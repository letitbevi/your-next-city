The women, who are duped into travelling to Damascus, often arrive in the country with no idea they are being sent to a war zone. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about Syria. I didn\u2019t realise there was war going on \u2026 The agent told me it was like America,\u201d said Gyanu Reshmi Magar, 25, who was promised a job in Dubai but found herself forced into domestic service in the Syrian capital.   Related: Domestic workers: 47 million people worldwide denied basic labour rights    Magar, who was trafficked to Syria through India and then Oman and Dubai, begged to be sent back to Nepal only to be told, \u201cWe bought you for $6,000 [\u00a34,000]. You can\u2019t go home unless you pay back that money.\u201d The trade in women from Nepal to Syria is thriving, according to a Nepalese diplomat. \u201cThere\u2019s a heavy flow of women to Damascus. Last year we estimated there were about 300 Nepalese women in Syria and since then the number has increased \u2026 It\u2019s a big, big number, maybe five to six hundred,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very easy [for agencies in Damascus] to get hold of girls \u2026 They place an order and then get the girls to come to Dubai \u2026 The girls don\u2019t know they are going to Damascus,\u201d explained the diplomat. \u201cWhen they arrive, they are shocked to find themselves in Syria.\u201d He added that Nepalese women are also being taken to other conflict zones, including Iraq and parts of north Africa. Nepal does not have an embassy in Syria or Iraq, but a spokesperson from the Nepalese embassy in Pakistan said there were about 3,000 Nepalese women working in Kurdistan and Iraq, adding that it was difficult to ascertain how many were working there willingly and how many had been deceived into going. Soon after Magar arrived in Damascus, she was taken to work for a family in the capital. \u201cI was completely cut off from the world. All I did was work and sleep \u2026 I wasn\u2019t able to contact anyone. I didn\u2019t leave the house for seven months,\u201d she said. At first Magar had no idea she was in a war zone. \u201cWhen I asked the family about the bombs, they just said it was the army training,\u201d she said. It was only when she got access to the house\u2019s Wi-Fi that she discovered the truth. \u201cI found out about the war through the internet. There were so many loud sounds \u2026 I was afraid, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d Internet access also proved to be Magar\u2019s escape route. She managed to contact her family in Nepal through Facebook, and eventually Nepal\u2019s embassy in Egypt arranged her rescue. After 17 months, Magar returned to Nepal virtually empty-handed. \u201cI was supposed to be paid $160 a month, but I was only paid for six months. When I left I asked [my employer] about my salary,\u201d said Magar. \u201cShe took $20 from her purse and threw it at me. Then she spat in my face.\u201d Nisha Baniya of the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions, who helped to secure Magar\u2019s release, says the Nepal government must do more to help. \u201cSince there is no consulate in Syria or Iraq, these women have no one to contact if they get into trouble,\u201d said Baniya. \u201cThe government says they do not have sufficient financial resources, but they should at least send a labour attache to these countries.\u201d Durpada Sapkota, a senior civil servant at Nepal\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, says about 25 Nepalese domestic workers have contacted the ministry asking to be rescued, but that it is difficult to track them down as they have not travelled through formal channels.  \u201cThe Nepal government has now appointed a Syrian national to work with the embassy in Egypt that deals with the cases of Nepalese in trouble,\u201d said Sapkota. \u201cWe are also looking into cases brought to us by families who are trying to rescue their daughters.\u201d One case taken to the ministry recently was that of Sunita Magar, 23. Magar, a mother of two young children, paid 80,000 Nepalese rupees (\u00a3500) for what she thought was a job in Kuwait; her agent tricked her into going to Syria instead.      Gyanu Reshmi Magar says she was paid for only six of her 17 months\u2019 work. Photograph: Pete Pattisson    \u201cSyria was a nightmare for me,\u201d said Magar, who worked there as a domestic worker for 18 months. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about those days. It was really tough. I had to work almost 20 hours a day. I wasn\u2019t given enough food to eat and didn\u2019t even get time to sleep. I was beaten time and again. I wasn\u2019t paid a single rupee. I went abroad for [my children\u2019s] future but got nothing. Even my husband left me and is now married to another woman.\u201d Sunita Magar was eventually rescued by a Nepalese man who helped raise enough money to buy her freedom. Now back in Nepal, Magar has a warning for other women looking to work abroad. \u201cI can\u2019t say don\u2019t go, but do go through the proper channels by doing all the necessary paperwork \u2026 so that if you get in trouble there will be someone to rescue you.\u201d It is a message echoed by Gyanu Magar. \u201cThe promises of all the agents are fake. I have brought nothing back [from abroad]. I only got punished there \u2026 I don\u2019t want anyone to go abroad for work, [but if you do] make sure you know everything before you go,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes when I wake up, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m still in Syria.\u201d", "title": "Nepalese women trafficked to Syria and forced to work as maids", "sentences": ["I didn\u2019t realise there was war going on \u2026 The agent told me it was like America,\u201d said Gyanu Reshmi Magar, 25, who was promised a job in Dubai but found herself forced into domestic service in the Syrian capital.", "Related: Domestic workers: 47 million people worldwide denied basic labour rights    Magar, who was trafficked to Syria through India and then Oman and Dubai, begged to be sent back to Nepal only to be told, \u201cWe bought you for $6,000 [\u00a34,000].", "\u201cIt is very easy [for agencies in Damascus] to get hold of girls \u2026 They place an order and then get the girls to come to Dubai \u2026 The girls don\u2019t know they are going to Damascus,\u201d explained the diplomat."], "publicationDate": "2016-01-01T06:00:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/01/dubai-skyscraper-fire-briton-tells-of-rescuing-disabled-mother", "tags": ["Dubai", "United Arab Emirates", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "A British man caught in a huge fire in a Dubai skyscraper on New Year\u2019s Eve has described how he carried his disabled mother from the 15th floor to escape. Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the inferno, which engulfed 20 of the 63 floors of the five-star Address Downtown hotel in the city as people were gathering to watch a New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display. The Dubai government said one person had a heart attack as a result of the smoke and the rush to get out of the building. Another person was moderately injured and 16 were said to have suffered minor injuries. The blaze, which continued to smoulder on Friday, may have been caused by an electrical fault, according to early reports. Angus Viller told reporters he had to carry his mother from the 15th floor amid scenes of panic and confusion. He said he had been pouring glasses of champagne in preparation for the fireworks from the family\u2019s balcony when his relatives noticed the blaze. \u201cI got to the fire escape before the actual fire alarm had started going off, by which point there were already people running in the corridors, panicking essentially, and I ended up having to put somebody on my back who was in a wheelchair,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cIt was basically absolute pandemonium.\u201d           Fire engulfs Dubai hotel before New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks    Viller said he had had to strap his mother, a wheelchair user, to his back as it was the only of getting her out of the building. \u201cIt was the classic thing where you would expect people to let women and children off first, but no, there was people shoving each other down the stairs and climbing over each other,\u201d he said. Nearly an hour after the fire began at 9.30pm (1730 GMT), some onlookers began to leave while others stood, pressed against crowd barricades, watching the blaze. Stuart O\u2019Donnell, a British nurse who works in Dubai, said he had been worried about those inside the building as it was in a prime location to watch the fireworks display. \u201cYou feel sad for the people inside \u2026 It spread so quickly when it started,\u201d he said. The Dubai government\u2019s media office said on Friday that 90% of the fire had been put under control. Randa, a resident of the area, said: \u201cWe heard a loud bang and then saw the fire. I was afraid the whole hotel would collapse on our heads.\u201d Police said the blaze started on the 20th floor of the building, which is also residential and where rentals of one bedroom can run to $70,000 per year. Footage taken by witnesses and uploaded to the internet showed huge flames rapidly climbing the hotel\u2019s exterior from what appeared to be a terrace or balcony. It took four hours for firefighters to put out the worst of the flames. A large fireworks display later went ahead at the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in front of tens of thousands of people, while plumes of smoke continued to billow from the nearby fire. A top Dubai security official, Gen Dhahi Khalfan, posted a picture on Twitter of a fire beneath a ledge of the building, saying the start of the blaze had been captured by a police criminal investigation photographer. \u201cThis is where the search begins,\u201d Khalfan wrote of the picture, which appeared to show a lower part of the building.    \u0645\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0644\u0634\u0631\u0637\u0629 \u062f\u0628\u064a \u064a\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0637 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0628\u0639\u062f\u0633\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u062a\u0647..\u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u0628\u062f\u0623 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u062b. pic.twitter.com/5MojgyVOoi&mdash; \u0636\u0627\u062d\u064a \u062e\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u064a\u0645 (@Dhahi_Khalfan) January 1, 2016    Outside the hotel, eyewitnesses described scenes of mass panic as hundreds of people visiting Dubai Mall, a huge shopping centre next door, fled in terror as the fire spread.  One resident, Malcolm Carter, saw the blaze catch and ran to the mall to try to find his friends. Within two minutes, he said, huge flames had spread 40 floors up. \u201cIt took hold so quickly. Initially I thought it was some sort of new year show but it kept on spreading. Security guards had no idea what was happening. Some thought it was a terror attack. Others didn\u2019t even realise there was a fire.\u201d The fire caused no loss of life and few injuries, but it poses tough questions about the safety of many of Dubai\u2019s high-rise buildings.  The emirate is renowned for its glitzy lifestyle and has constructed about 100 skyscrapers that are more than 180 metres high. More are being designed and built each year, and many have floors well out of reach of conventional firefighting equipment, relying instead on advanced sprinkler systems and other fire prevention measures. Thursday night is not the first time such buildings have caught fire. Less than a year ago a fire at Dubai\u2019s tallest residential building, the Torch tower, sent flames leaping up 20 floors, showering burning debris into the streets below. There were no fatalities.  In 2012, the 34-storey Tamweel tower suffered serious damage after a cigarette butt started a fire.  A preliminary investigation into the New Year\u2019s Eve fire is likely to focus on how the fire spread so quickly and whether it was a result of the materials used to clad the building.  According to industry sources, many of Dubai\u2019s high-rise buildings have been clad in aluminium panels with a thermoplastic core to give them a sleek and modern appearance.  Safety codes for high-rise buidlings were tightened in 2013, but many skyscrapers built previously have not incorporated the additional measures. With many people living in high-rise apartments, the authorities will want to send reassuring messages to its population that the buildings they live in are safe.  Last year, Dubai broke the world record for the largest New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display, releasing 479,651 shells.", "title": "Dubai skyscraper fire: Briton tells of rescuing disabled mother", "sentences": ["A British man caught in a huge fire in a Dubai skyscraper on New Year\u2019s Eve has described how he carried his disabled mother from the 15th floor to escape.", "The Dubai government said one person had a heart attack as a result of the smoke and the rush to get out of the building.", "\u201cIt was basically absolute pandemonium.\u201d           Fire engulfs Dubai hotel before New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks    Viller said he had had to strap his mother, a wheelchair user, to his back as it was the only of getting her out of the building.", "Stuart O\u2019Donnell, a British nurse who works in Dubai, said he had been worried about those inside the building as it was in a prime location to watch the fireworks display.", "The Dubai government\u2019s media office said on Friday that 90% of the fire had been put under control.", "A top Dubai security official, Gen Dhahi Khalfan, posted a picture on Twitter of a fire beneath a ledge of the building, saying the start of the blaze had been captured by a police criminal investigation photographer.", "pic.twitter.com/5MojgyVOoi&mdash; \u0636\u0627\u062d\u064a \u062e\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u064a\u0645 (@Dhahi_Khalfan) January 1, 2016    Outside the hotel, eyewitnesses described scenes of mass panic as hundreds of people visiting Dubai Mall, a huge shopping centre next door, fled in terror as the fire spread.", "Others didn\u2019t even realise there was a fire.\u201d The fire caused no loss of life and few injuries, but it poses tough questions about the safety of many of Dubai\u2019s high-rise buildings.", "Less than a year ago a fire at Dubai\u2019s tallest residential building, the Torch tower, sent flames leaping up 20 floors, showering burning debris into the streets below.", "According to industry sources, many of Dubai\u2019s high-rise buildings have been clad in aluminium panels with a thermoplastic core to give them a sleek and modern appearance.", "Last year, Dubai broke the world record for the largest New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display, releasing 479,651 shells."], "publicationDate": "2016-01-01T13:57:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/02/iran-business-gold-rush-us-business-investment-risky-economic-sanctions", "tags": ["Iran", "US foreign policy", "Business", "US news", "US economy", "Iran's nuclear programme", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "American companies risk missing out on a \u201cgold rush\u201d in Iran if sanctions are lifted as expected this year under the controversial nuclear deal, experts have warned. Companies from Asia and Europe are already flocking to do business in the emerging economy, which is set to come in from the cold should Tehran meet its obligations to not pursue a nuclear weapon. But while the accord has been billed as a flagship of Barack Obama\u2019s foreign diplomacy, the US might be among the last to benefit commercially. Only a small fraction of US sanctions \u2013 those related to Iran\u2019s nuclear activities \u2013 will be suspended as part of the deal, which also allows for a \u201csnapback\u201d of all sanctions in the event of non-compliance. Although US companies\u2019 foreign subsidiaries will be allowed to engage with Iran, a minefield of regulatory, transparency and legal issues could present more risk than reward in the eyes of many. Investors are also likely to be wary of the next US presidential election, with Republican candidates vowing to scrap the deal if they come to office. Other countries, however, appear to have embraced the deal and Iran\u2019s potential as a sleeping giant. \u201cIf you want to see optimism, you just go to Dubai airport at about 8am,\u201d Adam Smith, a lawyer focused on international trade compliance, told the Atlantic Council thinktank in Washington recently. \u201cTen flights a day between Dubai and Tehran, all packed. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite amazing and every discussion you have with big companies, small companies, middle companies throughout the Gulf starts exactly the same way. They say, \u2018Mr Smith, please have some tea. Let me tell you about my recent trip to Tehran.\u2019 It\u2019s exactly the same discussion every single time. Even companies that are subsidiaries of US companies: really, it\u2019s everybody.\u201d Smith struck a cautionary note about the long-isolated economy, however. \u201cBut I think to understand what\u2019s going on you have to be comfortable with having some cognitive dissonance, shall we say, over some inconsistencies here. While there\u2019s incredible, palpable excitement at a real gold rush that\u2019s going to happen, or is already happening, depending who you talk to, there\u2019s also real fear. You scratch a little bit below the surface and there\u2019s real fear. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much the companies that have set up in the free zones in Dubai. It\u2019s the necessary ancillary components when it comes to fair dealings with Iran. What do the banks think? What do the insurers think? What do the investors think? This is where the fear actually comes in.\u201d Speaking at the same event, Nadereh Chamlou of the National Iranian American Council suggested that Americans were being uncharacteristically downbeat and lacking in can-do attitude. \u201cI actually sense a great deal of pessimism in this room,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever Americans talk, they talk in very pessimistic terms. I think five minutes after you arrive in Iran you will see the incredible potential the country has ... Already what you find in the country is mind-boggling.\u201d Chamlou has visited Iran three times this year and recently organised a visit by 35 of her former World Bank colleagues, including half a dozen Americans, who found it an eye-opener. She added: \u201cThey kept telling me, \u2018Take us to where the real Iran is.\u2019 I kept saying, \u2018This is the real Iran! Where do you want me to take you?\u2019 \u201cThey were asking, \u2018Where are all the people dressed in black from top to toe? Where are all the poor people?\u2019 They were amazed. People looked good and well fed. They dressed nicely in the stores. Tehran is a very clean city; you don\u2019t find a cigarette butt anywhere.\u201d Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, visiting New York earlier this year, sought to persuade American chief executives that Iran\u2019s door is open, and this week the country sent a major shipment of low-enriched uranium materials to Russia, a key step in implementing the nuclear deal. The US is determined to maintain sanctions, however, over issues ranging from Tehran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorism to its poor human rights records to its continued testing of ballistic missiles in defiance of the UN security council. Chamlou said: \u201cThe constraints are more on the American side. I think the world is watching the United States more than it is watching Iran. It is important to really keep a little bit of an optimistic perspective in mind. The other countries are doing it. When you go to Tehran, it\u2019s impossible to find a hotel room. It\u2019s impossible to find a hotel room in any of the other cities as well.\u201d As the US Congress continues to snipe at the deal, Asian and European countries face significantly lighter restrictions on operating in Iran. British chancellor George Osborne has said he will lead a party of UK businesses to Tehran in 2016. Glenmore Trenear-Harvey, a British intelligence analyst who went on a fact-finding trade mission in October, observed: \u201cWe were very much johnny-come-lately. So many delegations were already ahead of us. \u201cAmericans, at the moment, are really going to be at the end of the queue ... As often happens, politicians haven\u2019t the faintest idea of the commercial implications of bloviating.\u201d With a population of 80 million, Iran has been described as the world\u2019s last great emerging economy. Despite its huge oil and gas reserves, US energy companies are treading carefully. Sara Vakhshouri, president of SVB Energy International, said: \u201cI really cannot imagine in 2016 seeing any major US energy companies going in. \u201cVery important for these firms is security. Even if the sanctions are lifted, if you\u2019re Chevron or ExxonMobil and you\u2019re sending American personnel to Iran, you\u2019re going to be concerned until relations are normalised.\u201d But Iran\u2019s youthful population, promising internet sector and middle class consumer base could prove tempting for less capital-intensive enterprises. Jeff Furman, chairman of the board of directors at ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, said: \u201cThis is total speculation, but the companies that require less investment are the most likely to go in. There\u2019s less risk for Starbucks or McDonald\u2019s to get a foothold with a few stores. It\u2019s an easier thing to do than building a hotel.\u201d Apple, Hilton Worldwide, McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks declined to comment on any possible plans. Not everyone regards Iran as a golden egg, however, especially compared with the likes of Cuba, which is geographically and culturally closer to many Americans. Kenneth Katzman, a specialist in Middle East affairs at the Congressional Research Service, told the Atlantic Council: \u201cThe problem is the US economy is a $14tn economy. The European economy is a $14tn economy. There are not US companies that are so active in complaining why they\u2019re being shut out and the fact the US trade ban is not being lifted and they\u2019re not participating, with the exception of some of the energy companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a big enough deal for them to risk political capital to go against criticism of the deal. Iran is very far away, it is very unfamiliar and there is a very negative perception among many corporate leaders. The memory is of the hostage crisis and all the various schisms, et cetera ... This is just not something that American companies are really going to be up in arms about.\u201d  This article was amended on 7 January 2016 to clarify that sanctions against Iran are expected to be lifted this year under the nuclear deal, not next year.

Air fares tend to be at their most expensive three days before travel and Friday is consistently the most expensive day to fly, so if possible, try to avoid those if you can.\u201d \u2022 Flight systems are loaded first thing every morning so flights that were on hold overnight (usually from business customers) will be released. This happens at around 1am, so you can often get better prices the earlier in the day you book, says Matthew Crummack, deputy CEO of Lastminute.com. And starting your long-haul holiday from another European city can save you lots of money. For example, take a low-cost flight to Sofia, Bulgaria, and you could bag a return flight to Dubai for under \u00a3150 with Wizz Air. The best days to fly anywhere are Tuesday to Thursday so you avoid the Monday morning rush of business travellers and also the weekend escapers.     Fly to Sofia, Bulgaria, first, and you could bag a really cheap flight to Dubai. Photograph: Rex    \u2022 According to Anna Watt at Travelbag.co.uk, passengers on a budget should avoid direct flights. She says: \u201cHave a stopover when flying long-haul. Indirect flights are often considerably cheaper, so consider having a day or more at your stopover destination.\u201d She adds that it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on social media for special offers. \u2022 Zoe Cornwall at Islands of Greece advises us to keep an eye on travel news and airline launches, as new flight routes will have discounts. Booking outbound and return flights with different airlines sometimes works out cheaper, she says. Cheap hotel rooms     Grand Place in Brussels this week: there can be great weekend deals in the city\u2019s business hotels. Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP    \u2022 Denise Bartlett at Trivago.com says her company\u2019s research indicates that booking hotel rooms one month in advance is the optimum time. Booking further in advance does not yield cheaper prices, with hotel rooms at their most expensive two to three months in advance. She says that although prices do increase closer to the travel date, they rarely reach the same rate as two to three months before, making last-minute booking a viable option. \u201cWe also looked at discrepancies between countries,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn general, hotels in Spain should be booked the furthest in advance (up to seven weeks before the travel date), followed by Italy, the UK, Germany and finally France, where hotels can be booked just two weeks in advance for the best prices.\u201d \u2022 Book a weekend break in a city\u2019s business district, says Matthew Crummack at Lastminute.com. Cities that are popular for business travellers, such as London, Brussels and Zurich, have fantastic room rates at the weekend once the suits have left. You can sometimes find rooms at five-star hotels for under \u00a3100 a night. Sunday nights are usually the cheapest night of the week to stay in a city hotel. You\u2019re also more likely to bag an upgrade to a suite when the hotel is quieter on a Sunday, he adds. Christmas and New Year is a particularly quiet period for corporate hotels. The last two weeks in December (excluding New Year\u2019s Eve) and first two weeks in January are usually the least busy. Check in as late as possible \u2013 there is more chance that the hotel will have run out of standard rooms and will give you a higher room category.     Hotel rooms in city\u2019s business districts, like London\u2019s, can be more affordable at weekends. Photograph: Jon Arnold/JAI/Corbis    \u2022 Bob Atkinson of Travelsupermarket.com says hotels often have non-refundable early-booking deals, often via comparison and booking websites, which can save a lot of money, especially in the USA. \u2022 New hotels will book rooms for up to 50% cheaper than they will for following years, says Zoe Cornwall of Islands of Greece. \u2022 For the best deals on accommodation, book direct, advises Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall: \u201cMany hotels, B&amp;Bs and cottages offer guests an incentive to book direct rather than through a booking engine or agency. You could be rewarded with a discount, room upgrade or complimentary extra. For example, those who book direct with the Fistral Beach Hotel and Spa in Newquay, are offered a free cocktail.\u201d Villas      Bag a swanky villa with an under-occupancy deal. Photograph: Alamy    \u2022 Maymie White and Victoria Hooberman, co-founders of accommodation provider Scott Williams, say holidaymakers should always ask for under-occupancy deals when making a villa booking outside of the school holidays. Often villa owners and operators will be happy to offer larger properties at discounted rates if the party is much smaller than capacity. White adds: \u201cThis sometimes means that for not much more than you could hire a smaller property, you can indulge in a much bigger, lavish, party pad.\u201d \u2022 Yvonne Bonanati from HomeAway.co.uk says: \u201cOur data, taken over the past few years, has identified that the first Monday in January, this year the 4th, has consistently been the busiest day for UK travellers to book their next holiday. We are predicting the same pattern this year, and expect that thousands of UK travellers will be going online to secure their next getaway that day.\u201d Package and family holidays     Pick your summer holidays week carefully for the cheapest deals. Photograph: Gregg Vignal/Alamy    \u2022 Sign up to email newsletters from your favourite travel brands, says Travelsupermarket.com\u2019s Bob Atkinson, because these will let you know when there are special offers, additional discounts, seat sales and other offers. Late or early summer packages are cheapest, often 50% of school holiday prices. He warns: \u201cDon\u2019t travel in the first weeks of the school summer holidays \u2013 they are the busiest and most expensive.\u201d \u2022 Derek Moore, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, says: \u201cTake full advantage of early booking offers \u2013 the ones that say \u2018Book by 29 February\u2019, for example. You may save a couple of hundred pounds by so doing \u2013 and all you need to commit to is the deposit, with final balances due usually only 10-12 weeks before you travel.\u201d Costs in destination, exchange rates and money     The low cost of eating out in Spain makes a big difference to the overall holiday cost. Photograph: Alamy    \u2022 The cost of eating out, shopping and activities make a big difference to how much you spend on a holiday overall, so consider exchange rates and the cost of key items such as food and drink. Bob Atkinson at TravelSupermarket says the best mainstream destinations for low costs are Spain, Portugal and Bulgaria for beach holidays, and the former eastern bloc for city breaks, such as Krakow, Prague and Budapest. \u2022 Right now, Eurozone winter sun resorts Cyprus and Lanzarote offer the best value, says Post Office Travel Money\u2019s Andrew Brown. Further afield, Canc\u00fan and Orlando are the cheapest long-haul beach resorts. He adds: \u201cThe strength of sterling against currencies for long-haul destinations such as Mexico, Malaysia and Mauritius makes them appealing.\u201d \u2022 In the past 12 months, the pound has strengthened most against the Argentina peso (by 44.2%), the Brazilian real (37.7%), Colmbian peso (26.5%), South African rand (25.9%), Russian rouble (23.5%), Turkish lira (19.1%) and Canadian dollar (14.2%), said Simon Philips of No. 1 Currency, an exchange service. It was also up against the New Zealand and Australian dollars, the euro (5.6%) and the Thai baht, but down against the dollar (4.8%). \u2022 Jeff Paterson, co-founder of Fourex, says the average UK household has \u00a3110.45 in unused foreign currency lying around at home, so have a rummage and use it! \u2022 Change your pounds in a bank in the country you are visiting, as you could get a better exchange rate, says Lastminute.com\u2019s Matthew Crummack. Also, consider using your debit card to pay for things abroad because you\u2019ll get the exact currency rates of the day (not a rate that has fees and commission on top). But do check for any fees your bank might charge for this, to make sure it is cost effective. Single travellers     Outside of peak season, solo travellers can enjoy reduced price or no single supplements. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images    \u2022 \u201cLook for single supplement offers \u2013 many package companies offer reduced-price or zero-cost single supplements outside of peak travel season,\u201d says TravelSupermarket\u2019s Bob Atkinson. \u201cOr try specialist companies for solo travellers (Solos Holidays, Just You) which omit singles\u2019 supplements.\u201d Tour companies such as Exodus and Explore offer adventure-style trips specifically aimed at single travellers, so you don\u2019t feel like the gooseberry on a couples\u2019 road trip. This also means you can opt to share a room and cut the cost of your holiday. Be wary of booking a single room \u2013 it is often a false economy. You\u2019ll often get a small room with a single bed and no view. If your hotel is important to you, pay for a double room and have a better stay.  Skiing     Catered chalets can be more cost effective than eating out. Photograph: Alamy    \u2022 Oliver Bailey, managing director of Chalet Finder, says: \u201cStaying in a catered chalet may be more cost-effective than eating out, depending on the resort. Research average menu prices online. Unless there\u2019s a large group of you, a shared chalet (with strangers) will be cheaper. You\u2019re not just sharing a chalet, you\u2019re also sharing the costs for the operator, which will give you a better price over sole occupancy. Book lift passes through your chalet operator, as it will have more flexibility over prices, and will sometimes throw them into the package. Otherwise, try to book through the resort\u2019s tourist office ahead of the season; there are usually pre-season offers to take advantage of. \u201cShare transfers. Book with a transfer operator that looks to fill its vehicles; this is much cheaper than a private transfer. Or if there are four of you, hiring a car may be cheaper.\u201d Best websites for low cost trips      Snow\u2019s probably unlikely but find cheap flights to Rome (and other city break destinations) by using a comparison website Photograph: Gabriele Forzano/Reuters/Reuters    \u2022 For flights, shop around, be flexible on dates and times, and book early. An absolute must is using comparison sites such as Kayak, Skyscanner  and Hipmunk. The TripAdvisor Flight Finder scours hundreds of sites to find the best deals and also shows how you can save money by choosing alternative dates and nearby airports. Setting up an Air Watch alert ensures you\u2019ll be messaged when flights you\u2019ve got your eye on go down in price. It also lists cheapest last-minute flights. Flycheapo.com lists most budget airlines that fly between all European airports. \u2022 For hotel deals, Hotels.com, Booking.com and Hoteltonight.com (an app), are good for last-minute breaks. For lower-cost boutiques, try Dorisanddicky.com and Mrandmrssmith.com/budget-boutique-hotels are good choices. \u2022 Other room/home borrowing accommodation websites in the vein of Airbnb include Nightswapping.com (you trade a bed in your own home for \u201cnights\u201d that you can use in others\u2019 homes, only paying a \u00a39.90 reservation fee); Wimdu.com; Vrbo.com; Roomorama.com; uk.travelmob.com (for Asia); and for London, Paris, LA and NYC, try Onefinestay.com. \u2022 See our long list of home-sharing and swapping websites at  gu.com/p/4ehgd/stw. \u2022 There\u2019s sure to be a package deal to suit on Icelolly.com or Teletextholidays.co.uk.

The PhD students do the groundwork - they\u2019re the ones on the front line, slogging away and reporting back. You slowly move up the ranks but casualties occur all around you, as colleagues are enticed by the offer of permanent jobs in industry. Eventually, if you can survive long enough and prove yourself, you\u2019ll become the head of your own group. And so it goes on. To be fair, that\u2019s probably where the similarity with organised crime ends. My research group doesn\u2019t offer protection-racket or money-laundering services. Instead, we sit at computers all day. It\u2019s not glamorous, but then science rarely is.   Related: Life as a PhD student \u2013 in pictures    I\u2019m currently in the third year of my PhD, working on the ExoMol project based at University College London \u2013 except I\u2019m the German arm of the operation. I\u2019ve been sent to learn the dark arts of quantum chemistry in a sleepy town called M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr.  What\u2019s a quantum chemist? A bit of a laughing stock. At least that\u2019s what my experimentalist colleagues say. Here, at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung, working on theory means I\u2019m in a minority. I estimate we\u2019re outnumbered by about 10 to one. To make matters worse, my research topic makes me a complete outsider.  New planets Over the past 20 years, thousands of new planets have been discovered outside our solar system. People want to know what they\u2019re made of, and if they can support life. By studying the light from these planets (or exoplanets, to use the proper lingo), we can tell what molecules are in their atmospheres. Well, almost. At the moment, the majority of molecular data needed doesn\u2019t exist. And that\u2019s where the ExoMol project comes in. Using theoretical methods (like those in quantum chemistry), we generate comprehensive spectral information on molecules like water, carbon dioxide, methane. The goal is to create a massive database for astronomers to use in learning more about exoplanets. There are other reasons, too. Certain industrial processes can use our data and we\u2019re developing cutting \u00adedge theoretical techniques to study larger molecules \u2013 but this isn\u2019t so interesting to the public. The big thing is that in the next five years, dedicated satellite missions will go into space to study exoplanets in more detail, and that\u2019s exciting.   Related: Who did you dedicate your PhD thesis to? Share your stories    Progress on the database has been good so far \u2013 the group\u2019s work on methane, for example, got a lot of media coverage.

It can take a while to get up to speed with the subject, but if you put in the hours and you\u2019re patient, it starts to click in to place. I\u2019m very fortunate to have two good supervisors; it makes a big difference, especially when things aren\u2019t going to plan, which is often. Mistakes creep in all the time. Days, sometimes weeks, occasionally months, are lost trying to find and correct them. I once spent three months trying to find an error in my work. I had to go systematically through each stage of the calculation \u2013 scrutinising every single detail \u2013 to change one line of computer code, run the whole thing again, and wait. In the end there was no mistake. The problem was with the experiment. I\u2019ll never get those three months back, but that\u2019s what scientific research is like. It\u2019s a slow and steady process, but a rewarding one when things work. Sometimes I\u2019m taken down unexpected paths. I was going over old data before the Christmas break and stumbled on new results \u2013 I have been consumed by elation (mixed with self-doubt) as I write up my findings before sending them off to be reviewed by the academic community.

Tolkin, from New York, reportedly reapplied for his job, which was opened to interviews after a World Cup in England in which the USA lost all four of their games in Pool B. Mitchell, 51, has a had a colourful coaching career. He coached the All Blacks between 2001 and 2003, losing only twice but leaving the role after a third-placed finish at the 2003 World Cup in Australia. He has also coached in England, as an assistant to Clive Woodward with the national team between 1997 and 2000 and at club level in two stints with Sale and at Wasps.  At the latter club he worked with Nigel Melville, then Wasps director of rugby, now chief executive of USA Rugby. In Super Rugby, Mitchell has coached the Chiefs in New Zealand, the Western Force in Australia \u2013 an association that did not end happily \u2013 and the Lions in South Africa, where last summer he was reported to have turned down an offer from the Stormers. While in South Africa, he survived being stabbed in the thigh and upper arm, during a break-in at his Johannesburg home. In New Zealand provincial rugby he coached Waikato, for whom he played in a distinguished career as a No8 which earned him six non-cap All Black appearances. He also coached at provincial level in South Africa. The US Eagles will this year take part in the first Americas Rugby Championship, kicking off against Argentina in Houston on 6 February.

I happen to love impressions and catchphrases, which is why I usually write in Shrek every election. I think Trump fancies himself more of a Batman figure, though. His first TV commercial positions him as a lone voice of reason in a corrupt world, a sour vigilante who has had enough of the bureaucrats and sycophants.

Photograph: Donald J Trump for President Inc    The ad goes on to remind the viewer that Trump is calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US. I\u2019m still a bit hazy on how he\u2019ll be able to differentiate between Muslim and non-Muslim would-be immigrants. It\u2019s not as though every Arab is a Muslim; nor is every Muslim an Arab. You might be surprised to find out that some Muslims are white! Boy, is that going to make for a lot of conflicted Trump voters.

Four years from now, Trump could appear before Congress at the State of the Union and explain how we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on \u201cover there\u201d and the ban must continue.

Isis and other terrorist organizations do not function with top-down org charts like they\u2019re a traditional army or a Walmart. There\u2019s no head to cut off, just a series of slimy tentacles.

Photograph: Donald J Trump for President Inc    Back to the Trump classics, as we get a shot of some people storming a wall. Wait. There\u2019s a wall there already? Why do we need to build another one? That wall seems to be working just fine. I mean, in that footage, it looks like all those people walk up to the wall and stop. That\u2019s what walls do, typically. I don\u2019t know what that is, since the ad helpfully avoids telling the viewer where they got that footage. It could be a group of over-caffeinated moms storming a Best Buy on Black Friday, for all we know. I guess the important bit here is that the Mexican government will be paying for this extraneous wall thing. He hasn\u2019t explained how he\u2019ll get them to spend an exorbitant amount of money on a public works project they (and half of the American public) do not want, besides invoking his expert negotiating skills, but I guess that would be hard to explain in 30 seconds. Maybe he\u2019ll build it and then send them an invoice later. Just expect it to take longer than a month to process.      Trump approves of this message.

We wouldn\u2019t be able to race today and there\u2019s no way things will get much better by tomorrow, so we\u2019ve made an early call.\u201d Thurles\u2019 rearranged meeting on Friday has also been cancelled. Heavy overnight rain put paid to any notion of the card going ahead as parts of the course are unraceable. Thursday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood Horses will need to stay every yard of the trip and more at Towcester this afternoon, where the rain-soaked ground will make the long climb from the home turn to the finishing line even more gruelling than usual. Cloudy Bob (2.05) is one horse that might appreciate the conditions, though, as he stays three miles but races over two-and-a-half today, and has winning form, albeit over hurdles, on heavy going. He was a faller last time out but is generally safe enough at his obstacles, and is certainly weighted to have an obvious winning chance off a 7lb lower mark than for his only previous win over fences. September Blaze (3.05), who was beaten only narrowly on deep ground last time out when returning from a long absence, should go close in the mares\u2019 novice chase, but the best betting opportunities are probably on the all-weather cards. Crack Shot (8.10) has a big chance from a useful draw in the last at Chelmsford City, and could prove to be a useful addition to James Tate\u2019s yard, while at Lingfield, Seychelloise (next best 2.50) is still on a competitive mark despite a string of consistent performances in recent months. Kalkrand (2.20), who has put up a couple of decent performances on the clock in his four-race career to date, has a very fair weight and is another who is worth an interest at Lingfield. The first card of Dubai\u2019s Carnival, which culminates in the Dubai World Cup card at the end of March, also has several familiar names in the line-up. All-weather fans will certainly be looking out for Mick Appleby\u2019s Pearl Nation in the Group Two feature event at 4.45. The seven-year-old travels to the Gulf from the trainer\u2019s base near Southwell, where he has developed into one of the leading performers on Fibresand, and the dirt track at Meydan should not cause him any problems.

When the movie ends we learn that 40 years later, Star Axis is still a work in progress. These people are not fooling around. \nBeginning in the late 1960s, a group of artists got the itch to find a larger canvas and sling a little mud at the established gallery structure. Heading west, these likeminded pioneers traded paintbrushes for heavy machinery, creating gashes in the ground, erecting structures and manipulating the very landscape toward their own sometimes difficult-to-define goals. \nAs with all artistic movements, it is hard to know where the boundaries lie and whose work is or isn\u2019t considered land art \u2013 but Crump\u2019s film focuses primarily on three men: Robert Smithson, Walter De Maria and Michael Heizer. Forget Dawn of Justice \u2013 this is the best superhero team-up we\u2019ll see at the cinema this year.  \nSmithson\u2019s Spiral Jetty, an enormous coil of mud and crystals on the shore of Utah\u2019s Great Salt Lake, completed in 1970, is arguably the most famous earthwork. (An aerial view may bring to mind some of the manmade Palm Islands off the coast of Dubai.) De Maria, whose sometimes playful work includes the New York Earth Room (141 Wooster Street in Manhattan, on the second floor \u2013 stop by!) incorporated not just the ground beneath us, but the heavens above in his masterpiece The Lightning Field.  \nThough he\u2019s the only one of the trio still alive, Heizer does not appear in any new footage, as he is very much hard at work on City, a massive complex of rock, earth and cement in the Nevada desert that, when it is completed, will be among the largest sculptures ever built. \n \n  \n  \n  Michael Heizer\u2019s Circular Surface, Planar DIsplacement Drawing in El Mirage Dry Lake. \n  Photograph: Gianfranco Gorgoni/Getty Research Institute \n  \n \nIn archival footage, Heizer exudes something of a True West persona \u2013 handsome, confident, gun-toting and eager to shrug off the philosophical implications of his famous 1969 work, an enormous trench cut across a natural canyon in Nevada called Double Negative. Smithson is so dedicated to his radical ideas that he actually died during a location-scouting process. De Maria\u2019s pieces show the elastic definition of land art, and while the others are seen getting their hands dirty, photographs of him measuring boundless vistas make him look like a cross between a master builder and mad scientist. While the three men did have their rivalries, Crump goes easy on forcing any triple yin/yang theories. (Though if you want to contextualise their output as a larger id, ego and super-ego, it isn\u2019t too much of a stretch.) \nThere\u2019d be no point in not glamorising these renegade artists, but Crump does a good job of keeping them human. Commentary from living contemporaries (among them, artist Lawrence Weiner, whose dulcet tones, Muppet-esque beard and compassionate attitude make him among the world\u2019s finest interview subjects) remind us that after the flash of inspiration, the 99% of perspiration is more keenly felt with large scale projects like these. There is also no pussyfooting around that most gauche of subject: dough. Gallery owner and 3M heiress Virginia Dwan, interviewed in the film, had her chequebook out during land art\u2019s halcyon days, and that\u2019s how everyone stayed fed. No Scotch tape, no Spiral Jetty. \n \n  \n  \n  Nancy Holt\u2019s Sun Tunnels in Great Basin Desert in north-western Utah. The tunnels are aligned with the sun on the horizon (the sunrises and sunsets) on the solstices. \n  Photograph: Nancy Holt/Holt Smithson Foundation \n  \n \nDwan isn\u2019t the only woman to get some screen time. Nancy Holt, who was married to Smithson, develops into an artist of great merit, but her early role was, as Weiner eloquently puts it, being an essential part of the stew. As with so many bold art movements, its origins were energetic people hanging out, talking, drinking and trading ideas during a turbulent time. Luckily, Holt made a name for herself with her piece Sun Tunnels, but Troublemakers touches on the often overlooked point that there are frequently very important people in the artistic process whose name never gets in the museums. \nOf course, the gargantuan pieces under discussion in this film aren\u2019t really for museums. (Though key exhibitions at Dwan\u2019s gallery in New York, an event at Cornell University and a later, less successful event in Bern are all discussed in great detail.) These are works that are meant to be the next Great Serpent Mound or Stonehenge, and when you get to hear devoted critics speak passionately (be it Willoughby Sharp in archival footage or Germano Celant today) one is quickly convinced that future generations of pilgrims will indeed head to the American desert like they do to the great churches of Europe. \nWhile Troublemakers\u2019 subject concerns some of the most unique and immersive artistic environments yet created, Crump, an author and editor of numerous books about artists, keeps his form comparatively pedestrian. Only toward the end, during some sweeping aerial views of Heizer\u2019s Double Negative, does the music on the soundtrack get echoey and the mood get contemplative. Though one could argue that there\u2019s no point in trying to recreate the experience on film. Best to rent a car, head west and see them for yourself.

That is what we have been working to achieve as part of a pilot project that Valerio has supported together with artisanal miners from east Africa. When I visited Migori, a Kenyan community close to the Tanzanian border, last year, I was welcomed by Bismarck Onyando, chairman of the MICODEPRO mining co-operative. 90% of the labour force involved in gold mining is made up of small-scale miners who work in small groups or by themselves with minimal or no machinery and produce just tiny volumes and often work in difficult, sometimes hazardous conditions. MICODEPRO was one of nine co-operatives across Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda funded by Comic Relief to learn new techniques, safer practice and more efficient means of extracting gold. This training is an important first step in the journey towards becoming Fairtrade certified, which they have all now applied for.     Two members of MICODEPRO building a new mine using timber, which under the Fairtrade pilot is designed to prevent mines from collapsing in the future, a common threat in mines. Photograph: James Robinson    As well as MICODEPRO there are some 10,000 informal gold mines in Migori county alone, a small proportion of the vast numbers of people scratching a similar, meagre living across the African continent, taking a chance that they too might strike gold. Mining for gold in this way is a dollar a day existence. It can occasionally be relatively lucrative if the miners hit a good seam of gold ore. For a few grams of gold miners descend a pit over one kilometre deep in the African soil to extract ore which is then crushed by hand and mixed with toxic liquid mercury by the bare hands of women and children. These workers pay a high price in terms of their health but earn very little. Most of these miners are tied into confusing cycles of debt. They are indebted to the owner of the land on which the pit is situated. MICODEPRO, for instance, has to pay a 40% cut of the miners\u2019 earnings to the landlord. Miners are also indebted to middlemen who loan them money to buy mercury and equipment. Typically miners will work one shift per week to repay each of their debtors, then a final shift for themselves.   Related: From bean to bar: meet C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\u2019s cocoa farmers    As Bismarck and his group build a new pit following the safety requirements which Fairtrade enforces, they work alongside other miners in other pits, who are making money but are not using any protective gear. The others mine bareheaded in broken shoes and ripped vests and shorts. They descend on manmade wooden ladders into complete darkness with the smallest of torches tied to their heads with an elastic band. Outside, the women of the wider community use hammers to crush the rocks brought out from the mines, pounding them into smaller pieces, one sack after another. The rubble then gets put in bowls with water and mercury, and is swirled about with bare hands. It\u2019s a clear sign of the sheer size of change that needs to happen. The miners talk of their regret about not knowing mercury is poisonous. \u201cWe are so sorry,\u201d says one. \u201cWe used to do panning using our bare hands. We used to burn and inhale the air. So many people have been affected for life in this area. Their hands shake. Their lungs have been ruined. We are explaining to other miners in the region about the dangers of mercury.\u201d They talk about animals drinking river water polluted with mercury and dying; the same river where local people wash their gold, their children and clothes. Fairtrade regulations are there to ensure mercury does not run into the local water supply. Once the gold has left the miner\u2019s hands, they never see it again. According to Valerio, most of the gold makes its way across the border to Uganda, then to Dubai for refining and then on to China. China and India are currently the biggest gold markets in the word. Demand for gold is growing in these countries, but concern over where it comes from and the grief it leaves behind, is perhaps not.    Related: A little less conversation, a little more action please    In 2015 America\u2019s Dodd Frank Act came into force. This requires US companies to provide information identifying the source of their gold, to prove they have addressed the risks that their gold might be conflict minerals (traded by armed groups). One unfortunate side effect has seen American companies avoid buying gold from unregulated, informal miners like MICODEPRO and other groups in the Great Lakes region of east Africa as they will not have the paperwork and be able to get these official guarantees. This makes the work that Fairtrade is doing in Kenya even more vital. As well as offering these communities protection by improving their understanding of health and safety and environmental issues, Fairtrade offers a small but potentially trailblazing transparent supply chain. US buyers can come back to the region, together with all others who want ethics with their sparkle.     A group of small-scale miners from MICODEPRO who have benefitted from the workshops and training offered as part of this pilot project to improve safety and help them to work towards Fairtrade certification. Photograph: James Robinson    The present looks grim, but for these communities who are working towards becoming certified, Fairtrade Gold may just symbolise the \u201cpeace, justice and prosperity\u201d they all want to see. Soon the miners will be able to start extracting ore from a new safer pit they have built. They are already talking about the plans they have for spending their Fairtrade Premium once they become certified, the extra money which comes with Fairtrade sales. There are beginnings of a loan fund for individual members so they won\u2019t get indebted to middle men. They have dreams of building their own office, of investing in secondary schools and clean water. One miner, Johannes Ojowi, tells me of his dream that future generations will not just mine, but also find other ways of making a living for the benefit of future generations. \u201cMaybe they will keep cows, sheep, goats and fish and the environment will be protected,\u201d he says. \u201cFairtrade has enlightened us here. It has taught us how to mine, to be safe.\u201d These are small steps, but for this small group of miners the future does seem different. MICODEPRO members are clear. History is being made.

The non-Olympic endurance events \u2013 points race, scratch, madison \u2013 are not normally a priority for GB cycling but at the 2012 world championships in Melbourne, as part of the run-in to the London Games, they decided to target them as well as the Olympic events to put on a show of strength and mark psychological points on the home turf of their key opponents, the Australians. The ploy proved hugely successful, with Ben Swift winning the scratch, taking a close silver in the points race and adding silver in the madison with Geraint Thomas. Something similar could be likely for London, given the strength in depth in the men\u2019s endurance squad, where Cavendish is one of six riders in contention for a place in the team pursuit and one of three possible starters in the omnium.   Related: Cavendish explodes to the front and all power to his elbows    Cavendish\u2019s complete race programme for the spring has yet to be finalised by Dimension Data \u2013 a rebranding of last year\u2019s MTN-Qhubeka squad \u2013 although he will race in next weekend\u2019s Track World Cup in Hong Kong for Great Britain before making his debut in his new team\u2019s jersey at the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race in Australia on 31 January. He will then race the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Qatar before the world track championships from 2-6 March, after which the decision will be made on whether he will race any one-day Classics this spring. Cavendish\u2019s view is that he and his new team should wait until he has some long races under his belt to assess his form after a winter spent training on the track rather than stacking up long miles on the road. As well as an Olympic medal on the track, another target is a second rainbow jersey of world road champion. The flat course in Doha should suit him as well as the one in Copenhagen in 2011, although there has been a change in the Great Britain team since that memorable day. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a build-up to this one like we did to Copenhagen,\u201d says the Manxman \u2013 the culmination of a two-year campaign stage managed by his former coach Rod Ellingworth \u2013 \u201cbut we don\u2019t need to. We have some of the strongest bike riders in the world and we can come together and ride well.\u201d Most of all, Cavendish wants to spend at least one day in the yellow jersey of the Tour de France. The maillot jaune is a key goal, being the one leader\u2019s or points jersey in the three major Tours that has eluded him. The Tour starts with four stages which should suit the sprinters, each carrying time bonuses for the first three, which, in theory, gives a decent window of opportunity before the hilltop finish on the first Wednesday. However, Cavendish is well aware that the sprint finishes at the Tour are not as straightforward as when he was in his pomp with the HTC-Columbia team between 2008 and 2011. \u201cThose big straight boulevard sprints, one kilometre long, don\u2019t exist any more \u2013 there was one last year, at Zeeland \u2013 so there are always roundabouts and corners. \u201cThe sprint trains have had to change, you have to be stronger earlier and you have to be ready to fuck [up] another team into a corner, so their sprinter can\u2019t compete. The general classification guys used to sit at the back and roll in together, now they try to flick each other for a few seconds. They actively want to stay at the front, so they can get some seconds if there is a crash. On a big straight run-in you can deal with all that, but on a tight run-in it\u2019s just carnage.\u201d Even so, the Grande Boucle remains the race that really draws him the most. \u201cIt\u2019s still what my season is based around. It\u2019s bigger than cycling. I was talking to one of the lads in the GB team about it \u2013 anyone who hasn\u2019t done the Tour, even if they rode all the biggest races in the world, can have no idea just how hard cycling can be. It\u2019s ridiculous how hard that three weeks is on the mind and body, but the rewards, the emotion you feel, the consequences of winning or losing, are just so amplified. It\u2019s a feeling you cannot get from anything else.\u201d", "title": "Mark Cavendish aims high with Olympic and Tour de France ambitions", "sentences": ["He will then race the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Qatar before the world track championships from 2-6 March, after which the decision will be made on whether he will race any one-day Classics this spring."], "publicationDate": "2016-01-09T10:00:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/white-man-pathology-bernie-sanders-donald-trump", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US politics", "Bernie Sanders", "Iowa", "Race issues", "US news", "US elections 2016"], "article": "The border You feel your whiteness properly at the American border. Most of the time being white is an absence of problems. The police don\u2019t bother you so you don\u2019t notice the police not bothering you. You get the job so you don\u2019t notice not getting it. Your children are not confused with criminals. I live in downtown Toronto, in one of the most liberal neighborhoods in one of the most open cities in the world, where multiculturalism is the dominant civic value and the inert virtue of tolerance is the most prominent inheritance of the British empire, so if you squint you can pretend the ancient categories are dissipating into a haze of enlightenment and intermarriage. Not at the border. My son\u2019s Guyanese-Canadian teacher and the Muslim Milton scholar I went to high school with and the Sikh writer I squabble about Harold Innis with and my Ishmaeli accountant, we can all be good little Torontonians of the middle class, deflecting the differences we have been trained to respect. But in a car in the carbon monoxide-infused queue waiting to enter Detroit, their beings diverge drastically from mine. I am white. They are not. They are vulnerable. I am not. Here\u2019s the thing: I like the guards at the American border. They\u2019re always friendly with me, decent, even enjoyable company. At the booth in between the never-was of Windsor and the has-been of Detroit, the officer I happened to draw had a gruff belly and the mysterious air of intentional inscrutability, like a troll under a bridge in a fairytale.  \u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d he asked.  \u201cBurlington, Iowa.\u201d  \u201cWhy would anyone ever choose to go to Burlington, Iowa?\u201d he asked philosophically.   \u201cI\u2019m going to see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\u201d Then, because it did seem to require an explanation: \u201cThey\u2019re giving rallies within a couple of days of each other.\u201d  \u201cWhy would anyone ever choose to go see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders?\u201d I didn\u2019t argue, because it was the border, but I could have said that the police chief of Birmingham estimated that 30,000 people showed up in Alabama to see Donald Trump in August and that in Dallas, he had filled the American Airlines Center, and that his counterpart, Bernie Sanders, has generated equally unprecedented numbers \u2013 vastly more than Barack Obama drew at comparable moments in the 2008 campaign.  \u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d I said instead. At this point he asked me to roll down my window. But it was all fine. Like I said, I\u2019m white.   Related: Rising deaths among white middle-aged Americans could exceed Aids toll in US    As I drove through the outskirts of the ruins of Detroit, across the I-94, one of the ugliest highways in the United States, the old familiar lightness fluttered to my heart. I love America. America is not my mother. Canada is my mother. But America is an unbelievably gorgeous, surprisingly sweet rich lady who lives next door and appears to be falling apart. I cannot help myself from loving it. For people who love to dwell in contradictions, the US is the greatest country in the world: the land of the free built on slavery, the country of law and order where everyone is entitled to a gun, a place of unimpeded progress where they cling to backwardness out of sheer stubbornness. And into this glorious morass, a new contradiction has recently announced itself: the white people, the privileged Americans, the ones who had the least to fear from the powers that be, the ones with the surest paths to brighter futures, the ones who are by every metric one of the most fortunate groups in the history of the world, were starting to die off in shocking numbers. The Case and Deaton report, Rising Morbidity and Mortality in Midlife among White Non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st Century, describes an increased death rate for middle-aged American whites \u201ccomparable to lives lost in the US Aids epidemic\u201d. This spike in mortality is unique to white Americans \u2013 not to be found among other ethnic groups in the United States or any other white population in the developed world, a mysterious plague of despair. In one way, it was easy to account for all this white American death \u2013 \u201cdrug and alcohol poisoning, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis\u201d, according to the report. It was not so easy to account for the accounting. Why were middle-aged white Americans drinking and drugging and shooting themselves to death? The explanations on offer were pre-prepared, fully plugged into confirmation bias: it was the economy or it was demography or it was godlessness or it was religion or it was the breakdown of the family or it was the persistence of antique values or it was the lack of social programs or it was the dependence on social programs. Case and Deaton call it \u201can epidemic of pain\u201d. Fine. What does that mean? On the I-94, you do find yourself asking: what the fuck is wrong with these people? I mean, aside from the rapid decline of the middle class obviously. And the rise of precarious work and the fact that the basic way of life requires so much sedation that nearly a quarter of all Americans are on psychiatric drugs, and somewhere between 26.4 and 36 million Americans abuse opioids every day. Oh yes, and the mass shootings. There was more than one mass shooting a day. And the white terrorists targeting black churches again. And the regularly released videos showing the police assassinating black people. And the police in question never being indicted, let alone being sent to jail. And you know what Americans were worried about while all this shit was raining down on them? While all this insanity was wounding their beloved country? You know what their number one worry was, according to poll after poll after poll? Muslims. Muslims, if you can believe it.  \u2018The American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it stronger!\u2019 My body is white and it is male. It is six foot tall and weighs 190lb. It is 39 years old and it has had to start running. It has had to start counting calories. There is a tingle in the joint of my right thigh, so I try not to think about my body. The tingling comes and goes. I know my body is going to kill me. \u201cA man who fears suffering already suffer what he fears,\u201d as Montaigne said. That\u2019s one of the reasons why men die so much younger than women \u2013 six years younger on average in America. Ninety-two percent of men say they wait at least a few days to see if they feel better before they go to a doctor, but I know what they mean by a few days. They mean a few more days than makes sense. It is hard to have a male and white body and to conceive of its weakness. In the same breath, my body cannot bring itself to believe it is the personification of power, though it evidently is in any rational accountancy of social status. It feels like a mere body. It feels mortal.     \u2018I\u2019ve never been to a place as white as Iowa. That\u2019s the honest truth.\u2019 Photograph: Darren McCollester/Getty Images    I\u2019ve never been to a place as white as Iowa. That\u2019s the honest truth. Whenever I go to America it\u2019s New York or Chicago or Los Angeles or Florida. In Burlington, at Jerry\u2019s Main Lunch, the signature dish is \u201cthe hot mess, eggs and bacon cooked right into the hash browns. The sugar shakers all have white crackers in them, to prevent clumping \u2013 a classic bit of commonsense American know-how. The hot mess is delicious. Why don\u2019t they make these everywhere? Why isn\u2019t there a chain of Jerry\u2019s Main Lunches serving hot messes all across the midwest?  The answer is in the rest of the town: everything that\u2019s going to leave has already left Burlington. The beautiful brick buildings downtown are mostly vacant. The most interesting street is the road out of town. The Memorial Arena, on the banks of the Mississippi, filled up early. Trump wasn\u2019t speaking until 6pm but by 4.45 the parking situation was grim. Outside the building, the hawkers who follow Trump on the road, event to event, sold T-shirts and buttons, three for $10. \u201cWe shall overcomb.\u201d \u201cCats for Trump, the time is Meow.\u201d \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\u201d Inside, every seat had been taken and the floor filled quickly with a standing room only crowd. Burlington is 10% black. The rally was 99.99% white. The people who attend political rallies in America are a specific genre of humanity, like the people who stand outside in lines for nightclubs. They know where they\u2019re supposed to go and how they\u2019re supposed to behave when they get there. They have gear. An elderly lady sat beside me wearing a sequined stars-and-stripes-hat she clearly takes out for just these occasions. \u201cY\u2019all from Illinois?\u201d she asked. I\u2019m not but I can pass. She goes to all the rallies, she explained. She\u2019s been a Republican her whole life, an active Republican, an Iowa Republican. For 30 years, she\u2019s been in crowds like this one. She plans to go, one time in her life, to the national convention. Like going to see the Stones. When the organizers passed around hand signs reading \u201cThe Silent Majority\u201d, she grabbed a dozen so she could pass them around to others. Cheerful helpful women were half the crowd. Angry and absurd men were the other. They wore T-shirts with whole paragraphs written on them: \u201cI am a United States Military Veteran. I once took a SOLEMN OATH to defend the CONSTITUTION against ALL enemies, foreign and Domestic. Be advised No one has ever relieved me of my duties under this Oath!\u201d  There were cars in the parking lot slathered with bumper stickers. \u201cWe the people are 100% FED UP!\u201d \u201cSo if guns kills people, I guess pencils miss spell words [sic], cars drive drunk and spoons make people fat.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m straight, conservative, Christian, and I own a gun. Is there anything else I can do to piss you off?\u201d A picture of Obama with \u201cDoes this ass make my car look big?\u201d The Republican style for 2016 is angry aphoristic humor. Behind comedy, absurd rage: America is the greatest country in the world but America is falling apart, government is the problem which is why government must solve it. This was a Trump production so naturally there was a VIP section. A door guarded by bald, unsmiling men, the bouncers who stand forever as the bored sentinels of indifferent celebrity. A swinging door at the side of the stage received and dispensed the best-looking people, the ones with the buffed neutrality of political professionals, the women whose faces have been tautened to a perma pout, the men who get their hair cut before every event. The woman beside me \u2013 Stars \u2019n\u2019 Stripes Hat \u2013 was wearing a pewter elephant pendant. A young girl in a bright orange dress passed out of the VIP entrance wearing an elephant pendant encrusted with diamonds. Elephant pendants were a theme, I noticed, and elephant brooches and elephant rings and elephant T-shirts. They came in all different price points and in all different styles: round elephants reminiscent of French cartoons from the 1960s, and strange pseudo-sexual shimmies, and with 1920s straw boater hats leading parades. There was one kind of elephant you couldn\u2019t find. An elephant that actually looked like an elephant. A realistic elephant might serve as a memento to the hundred elephants killed for their ivory every day. A naturalistic elephant would be inherently environmentalist. The elephants must all be fabulous. Like any good show, there was a warm-up act. In fact, there are two \u2013 three if you count the recitation of the pledge of allegiance. The first was Tana Goertz, an Iowa woman who had been runner-up on the third season of The Apprentice. \u201cWhat a good-looking crowd,\u201d she pandered. She vouched for Trump as a woman (\u201cHe loves women!\u201d) and as someone who had returned to Iowa (\u201cHow could you live in New York City if you didn\u2019t love people?\u201d). She promoted the idea which is at the core of every last thing that Trump does, that simple contact with the man brings prosperity. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the Trump train you\u2019re going places!\u201d She walked off to polite Iowan applause. The crowd would probably, all things considered, rather have listened to the Elton John music playing on the speakers instead, but at least she made the effort.  A more standard hype man followed. Sam Clovis hosts a conservative radio show and is a Tea Party activist who has run and lost a bunch of Iowa Republican positions. He just started right in with it. Trump was \u201cone of the greatest men to ever walk the face of this earth,\u201d a good line \u2013 the crowd could have laughed but instead they applauded, thus proving that they were not paying attention or would swallow anything. Clovis compared Trump\u2019s recent speeches to Reagan\u2019s A Time for Choosing at the Goldwater convention in 1964, which must have been, to his way of thinking anyway, roughly like comparing it to the Sermon on the Mount. Clovis knew what the crowd had come to hear and he gave it to them. \u201cAmerica and Americans will be first again!\u201d A collective roar shook the Burlington Memorial Arena. They so badly wanted to be first again. First in what was unclear but definitely first. After the roar died, the crowd was ready for Trump. But, showmanship. Trump let the tension build; the angry absurd men and the cheerful, helpful women hollered. Trump! Trump! Trump! I could barely imagine the pleasure the muted sound of his chanted name, from backstage, must have been bringing the man.  When he finally took the stage, the crowd surged; their phones surged. It was an orgy of phones. The men behind Trump scanned the crowd with their phones. The cameras in the back were recording everyone recording each other. Trump was the only person not holding a screen, the absence that brought desire. He started roaring, as everybody in the crowd stopped to check the footage they had gathered.  Trump started out with the clip he knew would appear on the news the next morning \u2013 Joe Biden had dropped out of the race and Trump approved of his decision because Biden never had a chance and Trump wanted to face Hillary. The mainstream media adroitly handled, Trump began his disquisition on the subject dearest to his heart: his own success. The Burlington rally marked the 100th day he had led the polls. He read the polls, poll after poll. He paused only to ask the crowd how great the polls were. \u201cBeating Hillary nationwide do you love that?\u201d The crowd approved of his approval numbers. And so he moved on to the more qualitative aspects of his greatness. His opponents just weren\u2019t winners. \u201cI speak from the brain but I also speak from the heart,\u201d he said, rambling like a rich know-it-all uncle \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m bringing back the jobs from China!\u201d \u2013 with brief digressions into self-pity: \u201cMacy\u2019s was very disloyal to me. They don\u2019t sell my ties any more.\u201d He described, in twists intermittently frank and self-deluded, the brilliance of his own capacity for political manipulation. He talked to the people he was spinning about how cleverly he was spinning them. So he declared \u201cI\u2019m a good Christian\u201d and that if he became president \u201cwe\u2019re going to be saying merry Christmas\u201d, but then he couldn\u2019t stop himself from acknowledging the cleverness of his Christian electioneering: \u201cI walked on to a stage with a Bible, everybody likes me better.\u201d Trump brought meta to Burlington, Iowa. And he did not deny the crowd that taste of celebrity they desired. What would he say to Caroline Kennedy, the ambassador to Japan? \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d A few spectators started to drift out to beat the traffic and Trump shouted about the silent majority and about how he says what nobody else dares to say and about how he will end free trade and how Mexicans are car thieves (big laugh) and how he wants a piece of the action from the Keystone pipeline and how he\u2019s going to help women\u2019s health and how America used to be emulated. \u201cThe American Dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it bigger and stronger!\u201d he shouted. At this moment he appeared to me the way every celebrity I have met in the flesh does, like a living pagan idol awaiting sacrifice, a puff-faced Baal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win so much,\u201d he promised before leaving the stage to Twisted Sister\u2019s We\u2019re Not Going to Take It.     Trump supporters at the Veterans Memorial Building in Cedar Rapids. Photograph: Scott Morgan/Reuters    I stayed to watch Trump work the line. Up close, in person, the hair is much more intricate than it appears on screen. Its construction is tripartite, its significance polyvalent. First and foremost, there is the comb-over, although it can be called a comb-over only in the sense that the mall in Dubai with a ski hill inside it can be called a building. It is hair as state-of-the-art engineering feat, with the diaphanous quality of a cloak out of Norse legend or some miraculous near-weightless metal developed in an advanced German laboratory. It floats over the skull, an act of defiance not only against ageing and loss but against time and space, against reality. Behind the technical display of the comb-over, as counterpoint, the back is as traditional and old-fashioned as a haircut can be. It\u2019s a classic ducktail. It\u2019s such a classic that I have only seen it in movies set in the 1950s. Not movies from the 1950s I should be clear, but movies from the 1970s about the 1950s. In between the comb-over and the ducktail, between the two follicular spaces representing the modernistic and the atavistic, the fantastical and the nostalgic, there is a third tranche. Even in person you have to look closely to catch sight of it. It bulges, slightly but only slightly. It is the real part of the hair, the human part, the actual hair. It is the hinge of Donald Trump. As Trump\u2019s campaign for the Republican nomination has unfolded, in all its unlikeliness, he has shaken hands with many thousands of Americans, and posed with many thousands for many thousands of selfies. And among those many thousands, not one has reached up to mess up his hair. Though he regularly brings up the physical appearances of his opponent, none of the other candidates even mention the fact that he looks ridiculous. Trump\u2019s hair is an act of defiant social pre-emption: call me a phony. I dare you. I fucking dare you. A few hardcore fans lingered on the fringes, just like at a concert. Everybody else had drifted into the parking lot and the town center of Burlington was soon returned to its emptiness. A Trump show is good value for the money, especially since it\u2019s free. They don\u2019t even ask for donations. The view from Fun City The morning after the rally, it has become clear that Iowa may be the bramble in Trump\u2019s path. A scandal over an errant tweet has cloudburst.       He blames the insult on a young intern. But the eight-point rise of Carson must be galling. Trump possesses the weakness of anyone who lives by the strength of their results. Results vary. When the results are down, where are you? Who are you? Trump is in the business of winning. Does Trump losing even exist?  I had a day between Trump and Sanders, and all I had to read was a pdf of Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s Between the World and Me, which I had agreed to look at for a book of the month club. After another hot mess at Jerry\u2019s Main Lunch, and a run to burn it off, I spent a day at the Motel 8 in Burlington reading, while across the street, the Winegard factory, manufacturing satellite dishes 24 hours a day, thudded like a heart without syncopation. Did you know you can buy a six pack of beer and a bottle of bourbon for just a little over 20 bucks in Iowa? What a great country.  The title of Between the World and Me comes from a Richard Wright poem called White Man, Listen! and it was never going to get much whiter or more male than me in the Motel 8 sipping bourbon and beer, on my iPhone, with the Jays and Royals highlights flickering in the background and the thud of the satellite dish factory in the background. The urgency of the book, the vitality of the historical imagination at play, rose like waves into crests of anger tumbling over their own force. It was all of a piece. And it all made very ferocious sense. Between the World and Me is one of those books that possess the powerful inevitability of a natural phenomenon \u2013 as if it accrued out of the ether that surrounds us, a crystalline formation of the outrage that defines the moment. To criticize is beside the point. It\u2019s just there. To me, the key passage in Between the World and Me, comes after Coates has been on television explaining to the host the desperate consequences of yet another police assassination of a black boy.   I came out of the studio and walked for a while. It was a calm December day. Families, believing themselves white, were out on the streets. Infants, raised to be white, were bundled in strollers. And I was sad for these people, much as I was sad for the host and sad for all the people out there watching and reveling in a specious hope. I realized then why I was sad. When the journalist asked me about my body, it was like she was asking me to awaken her from the most gorgeous dream. I have seen that dream all my life. It is perfect houses with nice lawns. It is Memorial Day cookouts, block associations, and driveways. The Dream is treehouses and the Cub Scouts. The Dream smells like peppermint but tastes like strawberry shortcake.   Right then, reading that passage, I knew that white people were going to love this book. What white people crave \u2013 more, they require it, they require it to live \u2013 is an alibi from their whiteness, an escape from the injustice of their existence. There are various alibis available depending on how much stupidity you can tolerate. You can say to yourself or to others that black people are stupid and lazy; you can say that you don\u2019t see color; you can call your uncle a racist so everybody knows you\u2019re not; you can share the latest critique of brutality on Twitter with the word THIS; and now you can tell a friend that she really has to read Between the World and Me.  Because that Dream of Whiteness, the dream of treehouses and cub scouts that tastes like peppermint and smells like strawberry shortcake, is a perfect alibi. Who lives that dream? Somebody else may live it but not me, not anyone I know, no one I could see in Burlington. That\u2019s a dream that belongs to somebody else. Always to somebody else. It certainly didn\u2019t belong to the Winegard factory workers who were drifting to their cars at the end of their shift. The whiteness of my existence was my iPhone and the fumes of bourbon and beer, and the game from last night and the tingling in my thigh. The tingling in my thigh was my body \u2013 the reality I can\u2019t look at because I\u2019m too afraid of my mortality.  To me, the best question ever asked about race in America has always been the one that James Baldwin asked, when an interviewer wanted to know if he was optimistic or pessimistic about the future of America. \u201cWhat white people have to do is try and find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a nigger in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you invented him, you, the white people invented him, then you\u2019ve got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on that.\u201d The obsession of intellectuals over the question of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, Jr active or passive resistance \u2013 was moot; the pressing matter was why white people were blowing up churches filled with children. Whiteness is a spiritual distortion, evidently \u2013 by the fruit ye shall know the tree. And on the question of white pathology, what good answers has America produced since Baldwin asked that question in 1963? And now that white pathology has returned to waste away its host, unexamined and mysterious, a golem.  In the evening, I finished the book and didn\u2019t want to think about my white and male body any more, or the tingling in my thigh. Across from my hotel, the Fun City complex contained an imitation midway, a bowling alley, a couple of bars, a replica diner and, tucked in between a hotel and a spa, the Catfish Bend Casino. The poker room is dingy but serviceable. A game started at six. I wanted to play. I wanted to find out how much fun can you have in a place called Fun City.  The youngest guy at the table, Curved Baseball Hat, grew beans and corn. A man with an angry mustache ran the conversation, a three-day beard beside him adding an occasional aside. The rest of us sat cooking quietly in the juices of our addictions, like in any casino. Everybody at the table knew everybody else, except for me and a black welder in town for a specialist job. It was happy hour in Fun City, and beer was a dollar. Everybody ordered a mess of them. And I felt just how lucky it is to be in America, despite politics, despite everything. Cheap beer and frank people and an honestly run game in a clean room. Even compared to Canada, the unthinking prosperity of the place is dazzling.  Three Day Beard had seen Trump the night before, and Angry Mustache asked his opinion.  \u201cI think he could win,\u201d Three Day Beard said cautiously, as if it were a criticism, as if it were all you could say of him, that he might have a chance to take the presidency, for what it was worth.  \u201cDon\u2019t matter,\u201d said Angry Mustache. \u201cNo matter who gets in, Washington just ruins them.\u201d  \u201cHe might be different because he doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d  Angry Mustache quoted a statistic, which I later check and turns out to be bullshit, that all congressmen become millionaires by the time they\u2019ve been in office for a year. Everybody agreed that Trump\u2019s main advantage is that he comes pre-corrupted.  \u201cIt\u2019s not even the money,\u201d Three Day Beard said. \u201cThey get there. They all have these schemes and plans. They can\u2019t do anything.\u201d Three Day Beard almost pitied the politicians.   \u201cIt\u2019s all broken,\u201d added Angry Mustache as a kind of given, the way you\u2019d state any historical fact, like \u201cGermany lost the second world war\u201d or \u201cFrances Farmer was once a star.\u201d The view of American politics in Fun City is snug despair. It is despair not just at who happens to be in power but at whoever could ever be in power. It is despair not simply that the system is broken but that any system, imaginable in the current iteration of the United States, would turn out to be just as broken. The choice is a choice between impotence and coercion. The response was not revolution but a shrug.  Curved Baseball Hat, the guy who grows corn and beans and who had delicate traces of soil in the lunulae of his fingernails, asked about an old gambling hall that used to be in town, and the reminiscences of the way Burlington used to be flowed \u2013 buildings that had been knocked down, women that were once beautiful and were now dead, fortunes made and vanished. Eventually the black player, who has said almost nothing except his calls and folds and raises, busted out. \u201cDid you see that guy\u2019s fingers?\u201d Angry Mustache asks when he had left. He gestured an inch past his middle finger. We were all, it was made very clear, in a room of white men. \u201cYou know what they say. My brother worked in the prison and he says it\u2019s all true. I guess that\u2019s why they say once you go black.\u201d  The rest of us nodded or smiled or said nothing, looking down at the cards. Now that we had all shown how white we were, it was a friendlier room. We knew that none of us would object to the evil of the others. What if the answer to Baldwin\u2019s question is as banal as it appeared to be in Fun City? What if it white people make the nigger to make themselves a little less lonely?  And I said nothing. I offered no resistance, though the line between the man in Fun City and the cop shooting a black child in the face was not hard to trace. Here was my alibi that evening: I am Canadian. Which means I am a spy from nowhere. Or perhaps I am a coward or something in between a coward and spy from nowhere. It\u2019s a pretty threadbare alibi anyway. Whose isn\u2019t?  Conversation drifted back to Trump. It was more polite.   \u201cI can see Trump,\u201d said Angry Mustache. \u201cHe\u2019s not the worst that I\u2019ve seen anyway.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m starting to like that doctor,\u201d Three Day Beard adds as an afterthought.  That doctor, Ben Carson, proposes a flat tax of 10% that would put the US government, estimating conservatively, in a $3tn deficit. He believes that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain, and he believes that Hitler never would have risen to power if the German people were armed, and that Obamacare is worse than slavery, and that Americans are living in a Gestapo age.  I wish that Coates had some crazy scheme, some utopian fantasy for communards in Georgia, or the return to one motherland or another, but he just wants the end of white supremacy. He just wants white people in America to grow up, to cede their inhumane sense of absurd superiority. I cannot imagine why they would. It\u2019s fun to drink and to play cards and to imagine what Donald Trump would say to the Mexican president the day after he was elected, or whether Ben Carson would set the flat tax at 10 or 12%. The ultimate alibi is ignorance \u2013 it lies closest to innocence \u2013 but if you can\u2019t manage ignorance, craziness does nearly as well.  I mean, none of it\u2019s going to happen anyway, right? Whoever gets elected, it\u2019s just going to be gridlock and outrage anyway, right? Did I mention that beer cost one dollar? A single, solitary buck.  \u2018Ellen Degeneres, eat your heart out!\u2019 The Bernie Sanders rally in Davenport was the precise opposite of the Donald Trump rally in Burlington and yet precisely the same in every detail. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d was replaced by \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d. Hawkers sold pins, three for $10. They read \u201cBernie Sanders is my spirit animal\u201d and \u201cCats for Bernie\u201d and \u201cI supported Bernie Sanders before it was cool.\u201d Davenport, at least near the Adler Theater, is the same Brooklyn-outside-Brooklyn that has conquered every corner of the world that is not a strip mall. The tattoo artists of Davenport do not go hungry. The cornfed hipsters at the Sanders rally look like they have probably attended a party at which somebody played a bongo. They may even have attended a literary reading.      Bernie Sanders at a town hall meeting in Ottumwa, Iowa. Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP    There were hype men as with Trump, too, although in this case they were twentyish women in glasses screaming \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Build a Revolution!\u201d Somebody with a camera from NBC asked a group who has brought their precocious children because they want them to be engaged in the political process \u201cCan I get you guys to look like you\u2019re excited about Bernie?\u201d They carefully placed their drinks on the floor, out of sight, to oblige.  The same specter of angry white people haunts Saunders\u2019s rally, the same sense of longing for a country that was, the country that has been taken away. The Bernie crowd brought homemade signs instead of manufactured ones, because I guess they\u2019re organic. They waved them just the same. They were going to a show. They wanted to be a good audience.  The fundamental difference between the Trump and Sanders crowd was that the Sanders crowd has more money, the natural consequence of the American contradiction machinery: rich white people can afford to think about socialism, the poor can only afford their anger.  Sanders\u2019s opening act was a congressional hopeful, Gary Kroeger. He hadn\u2019t been on The Apprentice but on Saturday Night Live, a forgettable lesser actor from the great period between 1982 and 1985. He started out, naturally, with a half-assed gag: \u201cthe fresh patchouli in the air is so beautiful\u201d. The sign language translator offered a mild smile to indicate it was a joke. Then, after a brief foray into leftwingery, calling America a \u201csocial democracy also known as a republic\u201d, Kroeger took a big selfie with the crowd behind him: \u201cEllen Degeneres, eat your heart out!\u201d he shouted. Everyone\u2019s phones rose up to take pictures of themselves in a picture imitating a picture from the Oscars: such was American socialism in the year 2015.  A few desultory bands followed, performing an assortment of leftwing songs from various historical leftwing movements. They harmonized on The Auld Triangle, a prison ballad that was covered on Inside Llewelyn Davis. The singer from Alice in Chains (remember them?) did an electric version of I Won\u2019t Back Down. An old The Clash song, Jail Guitar Doors, was sung by the subject of the first verse, Wayne Kramer. And it was all, so obviously, a nostalgia act, the indulgence for a longing of a time when music encouraged politics, when activism possessed an artistic face, and vice versa.  Eventually Bernie wandered out. The phones went up. The phones went down. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he shouted, leaving blank what there\u2019s been enough of. And then he talked about how he wanted to end the war on drugs and campaign finance reform and government that isn\u2019t for plutocrats, and how they were going to build a revolution (such an embarrassing word to hear uttered out loud), and America was going to be a social democracy, by the people of the people.  Sanders\u2019s exasperation was the principal fact to be communicated, more than any political content. Trump was about winning again. Sanders was about having lost. The vagueness of American politics is what astonished the outsider. It\u2019s all about feelings and God and bullshit. Sanders actually uttered the following sentence out loud: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is when millions of people come together to restore their government we can do extraordinary things.\u201d Nobody asked what he meant. Nobody asked for numbers. They applauded. Better to take it in the spirit in which it\u2019s given, like a Catskills resort comedian.  Sanders reminded me of a line from Seinfeld, maybe because Larry David\u2019s SNL parody was only a few days\u2019 old. \u201cThe sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup at a deli.\u201d When Ben and Jerry make a Bernie Sanders ice cream, I hope it\u2019s chili and ginger: the delicious hot flavour of nasal-passage clearing outrage.  Sanders\u2019s speech was much shorter than Trump\u2019s. There had already been the music, I guess. I had the impression, as with Trump, that I had traveled many hundreds of miles to look at a man\u2019s hair. Bernie Sanders\u2019s hair is as much a statement as Trump\u2019s. It looks like the hair of a tenured professor whose wife has stopped nagging him to get a haircut because the nagging doesn\u2019t work. You couldn\u2019t muss Sanders hair. The disorder is just as much an aesthetic as the comb-over. I mean it always looks the same. Somebody is cutting it to droop that way over the ears. The view from Tampico As despair has suddenly spread like a fabulous mist over the white people of America, as the white people die off in their unprecedented numbers, the commenters are surprised, a bit, but they have no plan of action. No policy proposals aim at ameliorating the conditions of white people.  How could they? If you believe the Case and Deaton report, white people are victims of their own privilege \u2013 literally. Their cherished right to own guns, and the vast increase in the ownership of weaponry, means that their suicide attempts are more effective. They have more access to opioids because doctors are more likely to trust white people with them. They have the money to make themselves lonely and drink.  I remember reading a passage from bell hooks once, the kind that circulates on Facebook because it sounds slightly unusual in its predictable virtue. \u201cThe first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage is psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves.\u201d Her compassion is admirable, glorious even, but also inaccurate. No one is more emotional than a piece-of-shit white man. They are sentimentality personified. How else can so many be moved to rage over the absence of a Christmas tree on a Starbucks cup?  That dream, that white dream that smells like peppermint and tastes like strawberry shortcake, comes with a cost of shit. If you take shit, if you eat shit, if you live through the shit, if you survive the stupid wars and the meaningless jobs, you should be sure of who you are and what you deserve. And if you are not sure and you have not received what you deserved, why did you take and eat and breathe all that shit?     Unharvested corn stands south of Council Bluffs, Iowa. Photograph: Nati Harnik/AP    In the aftermath of that deal, the choice, I suppose, is either to be proud to be white, which is a form of insanity, or to fantasize a post-racial cosmopolis, which is a kind of make-believe, or to be ashamed. So much easier to forget those choices, or to defer endlessly the choosing, or to debate the difficulties of choosing infinitely, because white male flesh is not under mortal threat, as the flesh of black men or the flesh of women. Our bodies are safe. Our bodies are the threat. In medieval monarchies, the state required the existence of a double body, one for the real world and one for the symbolic. There was the flawed and mortal body of the king, which wept and shat and screwed and died, and then there was the Body of the King, sacred, pure, indestructible. Race gives us all double bodies, \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d in WEB Du Bois\u2019s phrase, whatever you want to call having to live mortally through the judgment of others. The new white distortion, the sickness at heart, the pathology, may simply be the arrival of the awareness of two bodies: the dizziness and nausea that arrive with the onset of double vision.  Because they have to be like everybody else, their hearts are breaking in half. The morning after the Sanders rally, I found enough strength to look in the mirror at my white and male body, to examine its mortal and symbolic nature. At the corner of my groin, where it had been tingling, a brown patch spilled like spoiled milk down my skin. A wide brown patch shaped like post-climate change Florida in the corner of my thigh. Instantly, I knew I would die. And the next moment I started driving back to Toronto, to my wife and children, flesh of my flesh. Bernie Sanders wants a revolution to overthrow casino capitalism but the problem, or maybe just the first problem, is that the American people love casinos. They can\u2019t build them fast enough. On the road from Iowa, I passed at least a dozen, a dozen Fun Cities of various shapes and sizes, enduring various conversations about Trump and Sanders. The highways of Illinois are a unique vision of the workings of human desire \u2013 a nearly limitless marketplace for addiction and its cure. Strip clubs or fried chicken or gambling or church or rehab or cancer treatment. The I-94 spoke right to the unwounded body \u2013 the promise of processed sugar and pussy, or salvation from them.   There was one other attraction on the route home: Ronald Reagan\u2019s birthplace in Tampico. The beauty of the landscape around those towns, for some reason, has never been properly romanticized. There are no tourist buses to these fields, as there are to the ocean or the mountains, but the landscape is every bit as sublime. Reagan\u2019s childhood passed in the loin of the continent, the grand hinge between the industrial core of the Great Lakes and the agricultural heartland. The historical memory of his presidential monuments has been consumed by fantasies of small-town life but it is a landscape of whitewashed buildings against the undulating emptiness, a country roiling with dreams. You can picture Reagan as a boy in these fields, dreaming of movies and America \u2013 vast screens on which he could project himself. The highway runs like a river of craving through an ancient dream.  The ancient dreams are still so vivid here. In the United States, 240-year-old writings can be recited by heart by people who cannot be described as educated. Documents written by men who owned slaves are spoken of as if they could solve the problems of today and tomorrow and any conceivable future no matter how distant.  Thomas Jefferson believed that the constitution should expire after 19 years, so that the dead would not have dominion over the living. That fate seems to have arrived. The Americans are in constant debates with ghosts and their conversations with dead people are most powerful, most ferocious, at exactly the points where they are most nonsensical. They state defiantly that all men are created equal when any casual observer of life knows they aren\u2019t. They claim that men and women should be judged by the content of their character, when nobody can know the content of another\u2019s character. These dreams, these impossibilities, are the absolute and real foundation of their nation. And the dreams are so entrancing that it\u2019s unclear whether the problem is that the Americans believe them, or that they don\u2019t. It\u2019s supremely childish, either way.  Back in Toronto, my wife took a look at the brown patch on my groin and sent me to a doctor, and the doctor told me it was a rash from running too much, and I had been given the greatest gift anyone can hope for, in this time and this place. I had been forgiven, for a while, for my body.

Ever since James Bond used one in Thunderball in 1965, they have been a talisman of the hi-tech future. In every decade since, jetpacks have threatened to lift off. The world watched during the opening ceremony of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, when a pilot used a jetpack to zip from one side of the stadium to the other. But limited flight durations and the sheer danger has stalled progress. Now times are changing \u2013 and not just because Iron Man is the latest cinematic character to wear one. Several companies are racing to bring a practical jetpack to the market. \u201cThe technology is improving all the time, engines are getting smaller and becoming more powerful,\u201d says Yves Rossy, aka Jet Man, who has spent 20 years developing a personal jetpack. Rossy is a commercial pilot and his epiphany happened during a skydive. \u201cIt was freedom,\u201d he says. It prompted him to develop something that would recreate that sense of liberation but also restore the control that he was accustomed to as a pilot. His dream came true in November 2015 when he flew in formation with an Emirates A380 airliner over Dubai. \u201cI call that the magic moment. It was unreal: a parallel world of perfection and beauty. There was no past, no future. I was completely part of the moment,\u201d he says.           A recent roundup of jetpack technology.    Rossy is not the only one pursuing the dream of the jetpack. Mike Tournier of New Zealand-based Martin Jetpack says: \u201cWe have spent the last 34 years developing the world\u2019s first practical commercial jetpack that people can own and fly.\u201d They aim to begin shipping in 2017 with a price tag of about $150,000. Training will be essential, however. \u201cIt is fun when it works but dangerous when it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. The first public use is likely to be at \u201cflight clubs\u201d, similar to the way people can hire microlights and be taught to fly them. Emergency services could also use jetpacks for fast deployment across urban environments. But putting your money on jetpacks is still a leap of faith. \u201cYou don\u2019t make money doing this, you do it just for the love of it. I\u2019ve never seen anything as cool [as a jetpack flight],\u201d says Troy Widgery, CEO of Jet Pack International, whose company stays afloat by selling displays to shows. There is a long way to go before we see people jumping into a jetpack to nip off to work but, for the few, the era of jetpacks may finally have arrived. JETPACK AVIATION JB-9           The Jetpack Aviation JB-9 in action over New York City.    Employing the same engineer who worked on early jetpacks such as the one flown at the LA Olympics, Jetpack Aviation has developed the JB-9. The company claims that it is the smallest and lightest jetpack ever created and intends to show it off at as many airshows and other events as possible in 2016. As yet, they are not for sale; the company wants to first develop computer stabilisation to enhance the safety of the jetpack for inexperienced fliers. MARTIN JETPACK Named as a Time magazine top 50 invention for 2010, the Martin Jetpack is not dissimilar in appearance to the drone that Lady Gaga wore on stage in New York in 2013. Targeted at first responders, such as fire, police and ambulance services, the company has reached an agreement with Dubai\u2019s directorate of civil defence to supply up to 20 machines. According to the company\u2019s Mike Tournier, Martin Jetpack is also starting Iron Man clubs, \u201cwhere private individuals can come along and fly the dream\u201d. It runs on petrol, so you can fill up at your local garage. JETMAN DUBAI Commercial airline pilot Yves Rossy says he gave up having a nice new car every two years to invest in developing his jetpack. The result of this work is more like a personal aircraft, with a wing that sits across your back, as well as two engines. Rossy hopes that the product will become commercially available but, for now, he is happy to have attracted sponsorship to help with the development work. In exchange, he flies daredevil stunts that go viral on YouTube. JET PACK INTERNATIONAL On 24 November 2015, Jet Pack International showcased its product by flying across the Royal Gorge Canyon in Colorado. It has also been attracting interest from US television news, from ABC News to Fox News. The company is selling jetpacks, but only to those who have undergone extensive training in its flight simulator. The jetpack comes in two versions: one can fly for 23 seconds and the other for 33 seconds. NASA ASTRONAUT JETPACKS In space, jetpacks come into their own and not just for getting around. Just reaching for a tool or turning a screw will set the astronaut in motion thanks to the \u201cequal and opposite reaction\u201d that is masked on Earth by friction and gravity. Push a component into place in space and the astronaut floats backwards.

Its customers include locals and foreigners. Nearby is a UN office, a street popular with backpackers, and a five-star business hotel, the Sari Pan Pacific. Cars whizz past, or more frequently crawl, in both directions. A police traffic post sits in the middle of a grassy island. At around 10.50am local time on Thursday, a figure approached the ground-floor coffee shop. He appeared to be Indonesian, casually dressed. He arrived at Starbucks, which is attached to the Jakarta Theatre building. And then he blew himself up. The explosion caused mayhem, with glass blown out into the car park, screams within, chaos. At the same time two more attackers, carrying handguns, grabbed a couple of hostages. They were identified as an Algerian and a westerner, possibly from Canada or the Netherlands. Police spokesman Anton Charliyan said the Algerian managed to escape with bullet wounds.  The second hostage was less fortunate. He was shot dead on the spot, the police said. Another Indonesian man who tried to help the hostages was also shot and killed. It\u2019s unclear whether these executions took place inside Starbucks, which sits next to Burger King and Pizza Hut, or in the parking lot nearby, where the bodies of the dead hostages could be seen under a tree.            Jakarta bombings: I felt the blasts shake the building, says witness    Within minutes the police were scrambling to the scene, exchanging fire with unknown adversaries in the heart of the city\u2019s business and embassy district.  Indonesia\u2019s reformist government had long warned that the country might be a target for radical homegrown terrorists, taking their inspiration from Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  Over the holiday period Indonesia had been on high alert. Police said they foiled a new year suicide attack in Jakarta, arresting 10 alleged terrorists including a member of China\u2019s Uighur minority. Intelligence had suggested an attack was imminent. Now it was under way. At 10.55am a second group of attackers hit another target. They ambushed the police traffic booth in the middle of a busy intersection. Some witnesses suggested they had turned up on motorbikes. One of the attackers blew himself up. There was gunfire.  In the streets surrounding the building there was panic. Some fled, others stayed put. Black armoured cars screeched to a halt in front of Starbucks. Sniper teams were deployed near Sarinah\u2019s, Jakarta\u2019s oldest department store, across the street from the UN headquarters. Helicopters flew overhead as police tried to hold back crowds. After 15 minutes dozens of military troops arrived.    Related: Jakarta attack the latest step in Islamic State's global expansion plans    One of those critically wounded in the initial Starbucks attack was a Dutch national working for the UN Environment Programme (Unep). A renowned expert in forestry management, he was stationed in Jakarta as part of the UN team that provides support to the Indonesian government in combating peat fires. From the UN building on Thamrin Road his colleagues watched in horror at the events unfolding below them. Jeremy Douglas, the UN\u2019s regional representative on drugs and crime, peered out of his window. He tweeted: \u201cSerious exchange of fire in downtown Jakarta. Didn\u2019t experience this in 3.5 years in Pakistan.\u201d  In another tweet, he added: \u201cAmazing how some folks are walking and some running. Kind of denial or something.\u201d He said he had just got out of a car with a colleague when there was a tremendous bang. \u201cA massive bomb went off. Chaos and we\u2019re going into lockdown.\u201d     Police cover the bodies of victims of one of the bomb explosions in Jakarta, Indonesia. Photograph: Solo Imaji / Barcroft Media    Police pursued two of the attackers. The pair took cover behind a white vehicle in the car park in front of Starbucks and Burger King. Video footage captures what happened next. The two men \u2013 one in a long-sleeved white shirt, another wearing red \u2013 crouch down low. In front of them is a gruesome sight: the bodies of two people. One has been shot in the head. There is a loud pop pop \u2013 outgoing fire from the police.  One of the men fumbles with something in his hand. Then, casually, he stretches out his left arm. He appears to be trying to reach something inside a rucksack. There is a sudden explosion: a flash of orange and a whoosh of white-grey smoke ejected into a clear blue sky. The bombers had blown themselves up. It was unclear if this was an accident or deliberate.  By 11am, with the situation apparently safe, crowds had gathered to look at the bodies of three of the attackers, lying sprawled in the road. Several policeman stood nearby. Nobody noticed two men who approached from behind. One was wearing a Nike cap, blue trainers, and carrying a backpack. Another appeared to be his accomplice. The first man suddenly produced a handgun. He strolled calmly towards the crowd, weapon in front of him, and shot a policeman. A photographer, Aditia Novinsiyah, captured the moment in a set of remarkable photographs. The crowd ran for it. The second terrorist opened fire at another policemen. Soon after both gunmen were shot dead. By 11.30am the authorities seemed to be mostly in control of a confused situation. Witnesses had counted one explosion after another: five or six percussive blasts. Teams searched the Skyline building above the cafe floor by floor. No one was found hiding there. But police discovered improvised hand grenades and one other bomb, slightly bigger than a biscuit tin. The centre of Jakarta resembled a battlezone. Three bodies lay on the road near the police traffic post, its sign \u201cPOLIS\u201d visible in yellow capitals. The explosion in Starbucks had sent debris flying 30 to 40 metres. Rescue workers dragged away the body of a dead officer.  In the surrounding area guests and office workers were holed up, glued to their phones, and awaiting further news. MY Farooqui, general manager of a firm in Dubai, had been having breakfast in the Sari Pan Pacific. \u201cHotel is locked up from all sides and no one is allowed to got out or in. May God bless us,\u201d he wrote on a Facebook message to Reuters.  Ambulance workers took the injured to the nearby Gatot Subroto hospital. Staff wrote the names of those who arrived on a whiteboard. Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, meanwhile, condemned the attacks and appealed for calm. \u201cThe state, nation and people should not be afraid of, and lose to, such terror acts,\u201d he said. The casualty figures told their own grim story: two dead civilians and five terrorists. Five policemen had suffered gunshot or shrapnel wounds. After three hours, the authorities declared the incident over. Jakarta\u2019s police chief, Tito Karnavian, said the attackers were all Indonesian men from west Java, central Java, Sulawesi and the greater Jakarta area. Their targets, he said, were the police and symbols of the west. As if on cue, Isis claimed responsibility.  The Jakarta attacks seemed linked to recent events in Paris in November when a group of Belgian and French jihadis killed 130 people in a series of coordinated attacks across the city.  Indonesia\u2019s police spokesman General Anton Charliyan made exactly this point, telling the media: \u201cThey imitated the terror actions in Paris.\u201d This was true, up to a point. The attackers \u2013 apparently inspired by Isis \u2013 were certainly keen to demonstrate the organisation\u2019s global potency and reach. Their message: no western target anywhere is safe.

Visitors to the Algarve can expect to pay an average of \u00a316.77 for a three-course evening meal for two, including wine; \u00a3134 less than the equivalent meal at the most expensive destination, Jumeirah, Dubai.  The second-cheapest destination is the Bulgarian resort of Sunny Beach, which has seen a similar 18% price drop. There you can enjoy a local beer for 60p. Cape Town is the third-cheapest destination in the report, which found that a cup of coffee or a beer in the South African city costs around 91p.     View of Table Mountain and Cape Town.

However, a beer in a bar will still only set you back 83p and a 1.5-litre bottle of water costs just 29p. Last year Prague came out as the cheapest destination, but rising meal prices have pushed overall costs in the Czech capital up by almost 14%.

According to the Post Office, a fall in prices over the past year and a strengthening of the pound against the euro has left Portugal\u2019s Algarve the cheapest destination for UK tourists to spend money. Its latest holiday money report, published on Friday, shows that a typical tourist basket of goods \u2013 including suncream, drinks and meal for two \u2013 will set you back under \u00a330 in the Algarve compared with the \u00a3150 the same items would cost in Dubai, the most expensive destination surveyed.  Sunny Beach in Bulgaria is the second cheapest place to go, according to the report, closely followed by Cape Town in South Africa in third place, making it a cheaper place to holiday than the Costa del Sol in Spain. The report said competition for tourists among businesses in the Algarve and in Sunny Beach meant local prices in both resorts had dropped by 12%, a fall boosted by the strong pound. In contrast, the best-value destination in 2015, Prague, has been hit by rising meal costs that have left tourists paying \u00a340.19 for the basket of goods this year \u2013 almost 14% more than 12 months ago. Cape Town has become the cheapest long-haul destination, with the same basket of goods coming to \u00a335, beating Bali for the first time, mostly because the South African rand has fallen in value by around a third over the past 12 months.  The Post Office said prices for British tourists had fallen in 23 of the 44 key worldwide destinations surveyed as economies around the world struggle. Falling prices and the weak yen have made the Japanese capital Tokyo far more affordable than in previous years \u2013 its basket of goods will set UK tourists back \u00a346, making it a cheaper destination than Malta or Nice in France.  Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: \u201cIf sterling continues to hold its value, UK holidaymakers will have plenty of choice in the coming year. \u201cIn Europe, the best deals are likely to be in Portugal and Bulgaria, where increased competition to attract tourists has resulted in lower prices for tourist staples.

New flights to Costa Rica and Iceland are expected to help boost demand further in 2016, it predicted.  Brown said: \u201cWhen you look at many of the fastest growing currencies over the past year, it is clear that the strength of sterling has played an important part in determining holiday choice.  \u201cThe evidence suggests that holidaymakers have been doing their homework before booking and checking to see where their pounds will stretch further.\u201d Orlando (\u00a368.54 for the basket of goods) remains the best-value US destination, although prices are up almost 9%.

The Derby manager denied his expensively-assembled side were in \u201ccrisis\u201d but admitted confidence at the iPro Stadium is \u201cfragile\u201d at present.   Related: Gary Hooper strikes twice as Leeds are thwarted at Sheffield Wednesday    That said, this was a perfect away performance from a Birmingham side at the other end of the spending scale, tight at the back, and clinical in attack. Gary Rowett was spot-on with his tactics, but also perhaps in the way that he mentally prepared his team. \u201cI think when you look at the week Derby have had you could sense some nervousness around the place,\u201d he said. Rowett\u2019s men exploited that tension perfectly, pressing and haranguing from the earliest moments, and frustrating Derby with a perfectly organised defence as their pricy attackers tried in vain to find a way through. \u201cI think we\u2019re more suited to playing against the better sides,\u201d noted Rowett. The two managers live on the same street, and after a Birmingham victory that helped Derby out earlier this season, Clement and some other Derby fans put some congratulatory balloons outside Rowett\u2019s house. You would not imagine Derby\u2019s branch of Clinton\u2019s will be doing such a roaring trade after this result. The first half was relatively even, Jeff Hendrick missing the best early chance, arriving late in the penalty area to skew a Stephen Warnock cross wide with the Birmingham defence having decided against marking him. Bradley Johnson went close shortly afterwards with a shot from the edge of the area that arced beyond the far post, but pickings were slim. Frustration mounted. The visitors took the lead just before the hour mark, and it had been coming. They had counterattacked with purpose since half-time, one such foray resulting in a corner after Lee Grant brilliantly tipped a Jon Toral shot over the bar. Jacques Maghoma whipped the ball over from the left and the old warhorse Paul Robinson headed a queue of City players to nod home from close range. Exactly what the Derby defence were occupying themselves with while this was occurring wasn\u2019t immediately clear, but it was not marking.

Not that it did much good \u2013 the lead was doubled a few minutes later when Stephen Gleeson sliced a cross and Grant circled under it like a dizzy cricket fielder attempting a steepling catch, the ball dropping over his head and into the net.

Nine experts appointed by the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon produced the report on humanitarian financing to inform talks at May\u2019s world humanitarian summit. Officials at the meeting will be tasked with devising ways to reinvigorate the aid system in a time of unprecedented displacement caused by multiple man-made and natural disasters.   Related: People hit by disaster want us to do much better, says humanitarian chief    As well as providing concrete fundraising suggestions \u2013 including micro-levies on corporations, a voluntary solidarity tax, and increased use of Islamic funding such as zakat religious contributions and Islamic bonds \u2013 the experts had sharp words for a system often riven by \u201cturf wars\u201d. The world already spends roughly $25bn (\u00a317.5bn) \u2013 12 times more than it did in 2001 \u2013 to support the estimated 125 million people left destitute by war and natural disasters. But at least another $15bn is needed, the report\u2019s authors said. \u201cThis is a lot of money, but not out of reach for a world producing $78tn of annual gross domestic product,\u201d wrote the high-level panel of experts, noting that the funds raised for humanitarian aid in 2014 amounted to just 0.031% of GDP. The European commissioner Kristalina Georgieva, who co-chaired the panel, told reporters in Brussels that the number of people in need had almost quadrupled since the beginning of the millennium. \u201cIf they were a country \u2026 this would be the 11th largest country in the world \u2013 just between Japan and Mexico \u2013 and people in this country would most of the time be scared for their lives \u2026 They would be often out of their homes \u2013 60 million of them, with an average duration of displacement being 17 years,\u201d she said. Should the needs of citizens of this \u201cinvisible country\u201d remain unaddressed, the world will fail to achieve the sustainable development goals adopted at the UN last September, the report warned.     A Syrian woman and her child at a refugee camp in the town of Hosh Hareem, in the Bekaa valley, east Lebanon. Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP    Georgieva said fixing the aid system was possible: \u201cThis is one problem that, if we muster the political will, we can solve. Why? Because not only is it morally right, but it is also in our own self-interest. We don\u2019t have to look further than Europe\u2019s refugee crisis to understand this.\u201d The report focused on reducing humanitarian needs, raising more money and improving efficiency.  Global political leadership was identified as key to achieving the first of these goals, with the emphasis on preventing conflicts and increasing investment in disaster risk reduction. To this end, the report recommended that official development assistance should focus on fragile situations. The experts called for a threefold increase in funds for the International Development Association\u2019s crisis response window and an easing of eligibility criteria to allow middle-income countries to access grants and low-cost loans if needed. The experts also recommended that UN member states put 1% of core funding allocated to peace operations into the UN Peacebuilding Fund. They also advocated the creation of a voluntary solidarity levy at the May summit in Istanbul, although Georgieva said the panel was unable to agree on specifics. Some proposed an air ticket or gasoline levy, while others were \u201cdead against\u201d any tax. Georgieva, a Bulgarian national and former vice-president of the World Bank, said the panel had also looked at micro taxes on entertainment and travel. \u201cHere you have concerts, you have entertainment, movies, sport, potentially taxi rides,\u201d she said, adding that a working group should study the issue further before the summit.   Related: Syrian refugees: World Bank and UN urge major change in handling of crisis    Businesses must play a bigger role in the humanitarian system, helping to manage risk and modernise transparency, while there should be greater use of social impact bonds, micro-levies on corporations and Islamic social finance.  \u201cIf you take one of the Islamic financing platforms \u2013 this is zakat, mandatory giving \u2013 zakat is somewhere between $300bn and $500bn a year. Just 1% of zakat will go a long way to closing the $15bn gap,\u201d Georgieva said, adding that concrete products would be piloted to show how to tap into this funding stream.  To address inefficiencies, the panel proposed a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d under which \u201cdonors would not simply give more but give better, by being more flexible, and aid organisations would reciprocate with greater transparency and cost-consciousness\u201d. This pact would also involve the use of more cash-based aid, give a greater role to local organisations, and prompt donors to give more long-term, predictable funding. \u201cRight now, we have \u2018competitive inefficiency\u2019,\u201d said Georgieva. \u201cSomething happens and we are like eight-year-olds playing soccer \u2013 we are all chasing the ball.\u201d     A Yemen-based UN worker inspects emergency aid arriving at Sana\u2019a airport. Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA    The report praised the dedication of thousands of humanitarian workers but had sharp words for the \u201cwasteful\u201d competition between aid agencies for funds. \u201cWhile the need for joint planning is often talked about, in reality every organisation is an island. \u2018Turf wars\u2019 are a common occurrence, with each organisation trying to position itself as the best implementer,\u201d it said. The study was to be presented to Ban in Dubai on Sunday; the location was deliberate, Georgieva said. \u201cTragically this is the region that is now the example of people in need. Three out of every four appeals that exceed $1bn take place in the Middle East.\u201d The experts stressed change was urgent. If current trends continue, by 2030, when the SDGs are due to expire, the cost of humanitarian assistance will have risen to $50bn and 62% of the world\u2019s poor could be living in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Despite the challenges, they said they were optimistic. \u201cThe record sums being raised are a powerful signal that our collective humanity is a force to be reckoned with and can be harnessed to even greater effect.

He might kick me for saying this, but he wasn\u2019t the best player in the world yet he worked like a dog on the things he was better at than others and became the best footballer he could be. As a child, success to me revolved around the idea of being a successful footballer. I wasn\u2019t academic but always wanted to do something active or creative, something other than sitting behind a desk. I was a bit of a fantasist. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know where I was heading, but everything I did want to do, I wanted to be the very best at. When I was four, my parents had split and Mum said we were going on a little holiday to Skegness, but she never took us back to Worksop. She and the man who became my stepfather were strict, but they instilled in me that you only get out of life what you put into it, and if you do put your all in, you will succeed. From the age of 11 to 14, I did a summer job as a donkey boy on the beach. I\u2019d get up at 5.30am to cycle to the outskirts to groom, water, feed and saddle the donkeys. When I was 15, my mum encouraged me to help in the B&amp;B she ran \u2013 stocking the bar, preparing starters, emptying bins, everything. I\u2019d save up any money I made and buy a quality pair of trainers. When you\u2019re exposed young to some graft, it teaches you the virtues of work, an appreciation of money and an understanding of the mechanics of life. Around the time I was doing my GCSEs, I was being bullied and I turned inwards. Fishing had always been a big joy, so rather than go to school I\u2019d sneak off to Boston to go fishing. My parents went ballistic when they found out, but it\u2019d given me time to be alone and daydream, and thankfully I discovered the idea of being a chef. I\u2019ve always found daydreaming useful; nowadays I carry a Moleskine book to jot down ideas. A lot of people are too scared to follow dreams, therefore they don\u2019t achieve. What I mean is, if you do have big dreams, don\u2019t be afraid to chase them. At the same time, don\u2019t over-think things. Nowadays, I deal with restaurants and projects around the globe on a day-to-day basis and that has to be handled naturally, taking each new challenge as it comes along and making sure everything\u2019s done to the best of my and everyone\u2019s ability.     Jason Athertonin Hong Kong in 2013. Photograph: Richard Saker for Observer Food Monthly    At 16 I\u2019d worked briefly at the County Hotel in Skegness, making mediocre trout with almonds and tomato soups. But you need inspiration and mine came from a book I bought for \u00a312.95 from WH Smith in Skegness \u2013 Dining In France by Christian Millau. I thought, \u201cWow. As long as I\u2019m going to cook food, this is the sort I want to cook.\u201d And when you\u2019ve decided to do something for the rest of your life, you\u2019ve got to get your bum in motion and move to the best place to make a success of learning your craft. When I was 17, that clearly was London. If you send applications to lots of top chefs and get a day trial with one of them, you put your soul into getting the job. For me, that was a commis position at Boyd Gilmour\u2019s Covent Garden restaurant. My sister said, \u201cJason, if you leave without telling Mum, she\u2019ll go crazy\u201d, and I said, \u201cYes, she\u2019ll insist I stay in Skeggy, do college and wait until I\u2019m 20.\u201d So I just packed my bags and left. And thank goodness. (My parents still can\u2019t believe it when I mention that I\u2019m cooking that evening at 10 Downing Street or I\u2019m at a Lakers game with Benedict Cumberbatch). You have to overcome the terror of moving to a city, but I lived in a decent youth hostel, remained determined and got stuck in. It\u2019s a matter of impressing the chef-owner that you could be one of the special chefs who he can be confident will make his kitchen great. I think it\u2019s important for success that, after years of being a sous chef, I started learning about kitchen management and rotas and so on at [Oliver Peyton\u2019s] Coast, which had 150 diners for lunch, 350 for dinner. By comparison, you don\u2019t learn so much at Michelin-star restaurants, where everyone just turns up for work and does their own job. But going to Manchester to run Mash &amp; Air [again for Peyton] came too quickly after that. I was 26 and rented my first posh apartment there off Alex Ferguson\u2019s son. I suppose that\u2019s what\u2019s considered success and cool, after years of sharing little flats with five other chefs. But I was no way ready for the responsibility, with 55 chefs under me. Manchester in the 90s was a pretty brutal place, and staff would get wasted and not turn up for work. I was snowed under and it nearly broke my career. So sometimes you have to step back and admit you weren\u2019t ready. I literally dropped everything, including my girlfriend, and went off to Spain to do an internship as a chef de partie, working for free under the great Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli. It was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. It felt wonderful to go in every day and open scallops, prep asparagus and wash spinach properly. And then in the afternoon \u2013 rather than going through orders and attending meetings about hygiene \u2013 sit with my feet in the sea, daydreaming for two hours. It was like therapy.   Related: The kitchen apprentices: have knives, will travel    You want things perfect all the time as a young chef \u2013 especially when you\u2019re single-minded and starting to push yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s very easy to lose your temper and scream and bully, and very hard to be pragmatic and say, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it right tomorrow by doing this and this instead.\u201d You have to learn to behave maturely; you can\u2019t just wake up one day a better person. It\u2019s piece by piece. So, better today than yesterday \u2013 that\u2019s my mantra. When Gordon Ramsay asked me to go to Dubai in 2000 to executive chef at Verre, I was single and thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst case scenario? No one\u2019s going to die.\u201d Four years later, I came back and opened Maze and was credited with turning it into the biggest money-spinner in Gordon\u2019s empire, but there were assorted factors in its success. Every so often you hit on a concept that fits the time \u2013 this was the mid-noughties \u2013 and there was a boom going on, there was Gordon\u2019s name, backing power and restaurateuring skills to start a restaurant of magnitude, plus my cooking skills. And we achieved something quite unusual \u2013 haute cuisine stepped up and operated like an incredible machine. You couldn\u2019t get a table for months; people were willing to pay anything to get in. It\u2019s important what Gordon told me, late in 2005: \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Of course you want to be successful, we all do, but with everything you do, make sure you do it correctly.\u201d And he was so right. Once, I thought I was impressing him by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve not had a day off in four months\u201d, and he replied, \u201cThen you\u2019re stupid. You should be putting pressure on your sous chef. A kitchen should run just as well without you as with, Jason. I\u2019ll look at you as a success when you haven\u2019t got more bags under your eyes than I count at Heathrow.\u201d Since I left Ramsay Holdings and started Jason Atherton Ltd in 2010, I have combined my dreams with opportunities as they\u2019ve come along, and the company currently has investments in 14 restaurants worldwide. I spend up to 40% of my time travelling around them, but of course it\u2019s impossible, believe me, to run 14 restaurants day in, day out. You have to have strategic partners, really good restaurateurs doing that on the ground, with the chef de cuisines receiving a percentage so they drive up the covers, touch tables, work with the managers and report to me. It\u2019s very important that never at any point have I said, or implied by putting my name in the restaurant name, that I\u2019d be cooking in them, except at Pollen Street Social. That is the only restaurant where I\u2019m chef de cuisine. Yet every day I communicate with all the restaurants. Skype, text, phone calls, emails, you name it, plus weekly conference calls. Of course, every complaint received from a customer anywhere \u2013 about food quality, service or anything \u2013 is forwarded to and dealt with by me and my wife. The reason we handle those is that we have more of an emotional attachment and can use complaints to over-view failure and correct for success. I might spend four days in each city when travelling. Say, four in Hong Kong, four in Shanghai, four in Dubai, then home. At times it\u2019s pretty tough on the body, but I watch what I eat and go to the gym pretty much every weekday, then try to enjoy myself more during weekends, and it seems to work, you know. Functioning globally becomes natural, whether you\u2019re travelling or at home. Time zones become nothing more than just a number on a clock \u2013 you deal with situations as you or they wake up in different zones. There\u2019s always a possibility of something going on at any moment \u2013 there\u2019s no time within each 24 hours when nothing might happen.   Related: Jason Atherton: a 21st-century cook's tour of the east    It sounds odd to say, with some of the restaurants still having massive debt, but I don\u2019t feel under financial pressure. When I only had one, I felt under immense financial pressure, but now we\u2019ve got 14 \u2013 and there\u2019s another six opening over the next four years \u2013 I don\u2019t feel it. It\u2019s bizarre but true. Probably my biggest failure in life is that I wasn\u2019t as good a husband to my wife as I could have been in our first six years of marriage, as everything was about me. We were living separate lives and I regret that greatly, but I set about rectifying it by involving her much more, because I\u2019m a big believer in marriage, keeping family together and being a team. That\u2019s success. People always say, \u201cYou must be so tired, Jason.\u201d But it depends on which day you catch me. Some days I\u2019m more tired than others, but I definitely live in a constant state of varying tiredness and have been since I was 16. But it\u2019s not my thing to drown in alcohol. Yesterday, after we\u2019d been super-busy at Pollen Street Social, I went home, had a cup of tea and a chat with my wife and then we started to watch the film Kajaki: The True Story, and I nodded off to that, no problem. I feel really privileged and honoured to have a job I love, a family supporting and enriching my life, that customers are eating our food and appreciating it and coming back for more, and that I have a great team who have the same ethos as me. So that\u2019s as good a work/life balance as I can think of. Once I\u2019m 58, I\u2019ll stop working nights and my kids will be in their early 20s. I won\u2019t be able to go to clubs with them but at least there\u2019ll be time for family dinners. It\u2019s intriguing how people perceive my success. An old chef friend I bumped into a while ago said, \u201cOh everyone\u2019s so proud of your success\u201d, then added, \u201cI heard you\u2019ve just bought a massive house in Mayfair.\u201d Yet I still live in the same house in Balham as when I started the company.

Does it offer viable solutions to the widening gap between humanitarian needs and available resources? Is the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d it offers enough to transform a struggling aid system? All eyes are on humanitarian financing in 2016. The World Humanitarian Summit in May is fast approaching and the launch of the report comes against a backdrop of the displacement of millions of people in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Iraq and other disaster and conflict-affected countries. Their suffering reminds us of the need to get this right fast. The report contains many good ideas; the strongest and most exciting are those that speak to audiences beyond the usual humanitarian crowd. For example, giving middle-income countries access to grants and low-income loans to finance large-scale refugee hosting, working with the insurance industry to adapt its risk-financing strategies to humanitarian situations, and tapping into the billions of dollars generated each year through Islamic social finance.   Related: The aid system is broken \u2013 how can we fix it?    Few of the initiatives suggested are new \u2013 nor does the panel claim they are. Many have been discussed at length by other groups, and already piloted and reviewed in some cases. But seen together for the first time, and presented as compellingly as they are in the report, they have the potential to expand the responsibility to act beyond the narrow confines of the humanitarian community. The recommendations use finance as a driving force to enrich the aid ecosystem and push for institutional changes to bridge the humanitarian and development divide. This challenge is more pertinent than ever today given the increasingly protracted nature of crises around the world. How radical is the \u2018grand bargain\u2019?   The \u201cgrand bargain\u201d comes at the end of the report and may leave many readers asking whether the deal is radical enough. It proposes that the major donors and largest humanitarian organisations commit to make their spending more flexible, efficient, transparent and effective. The bargain is aimed in particular at the five largest government donors of humanitarian assistance, those that supplied over 60% of the international humanitarian resources in 2014; and the six UN agencies that spent nearly half of it. The logic is that if the giants can get it right, other donors and aid organisations will follow. But starting here does risk establishing the terms of the bargain in favour of these powerful few and thereby entrenching the concentration of funds even further, rather than encouraging a more diverse and equitable distribution of resources as recommended elsewhere in the report.  There is also the question of those without a seat at the bargaining table. The Gulf states and other emerging donors are clearly a central part of the financing solution. The choice of Dubai for the report launch yesterday reminds us of how important they are. The report is unclear however whether Gulf states are invited to negotiate the terms of the bargain, or to be bound by it. The same goes for international, national and local NGOs \u2013 vital links in the chain between UN agencies and crisis-affected populations \u2013 who are already asking what their role is in the bargaining process. The specific components of the bargain also appear to fall short of the panel\u2019s ambition to ensure that resources are found to meet the needs of those most likely to be left behind. We don\u2019t just need more joint assessments between a few big humanitarian agencies, we need a radical rethink of what we know about what makes people vulnerable to crisis in the first place and how to match their needs with the right resources. On transparency, the grand bargain may do something to improve reporting of international humanitarian assistance by a few, but we should aim for more. A bigger vision is required, in which all resources, beyond just international humanitarian resources can be counted.    Related: The world's 3.5bn young people are the key to change \u2013 let's not shut them out    Turning the grand bargain into a big deal will clearly be a challenge. Vested interests, competition for scarce resources, and the humanitarian-development divide are as old as aid itself. What\u2019s different now, perhaps, is the window of opportunity that the World Humanitarian Summit has created. Responsibility for taking the panel\u2019s recommendations forward now passes from the hands of technical experts to those of the political and financial decision-makers who will be represented en masse in Istanbul in May. This combined with the scale of the problem, and the reputation and clout of the panel members themselves as they go out and canvass support, may be the tipping point that we\u2019ve all been waiting for.  The grand bargain will be a central topic of numerous global-level humanitarian meetings in the coming months. Even more interesting will be to see whether the panel\u2019s recommendations get picked up outside of the humanitarian calendar. Will other actors agree that this is too important to ignore, and that they too have a stake in addressing the humanitarian financing gap? If the answer is yes, then the grand bargain may turn out to be a big deal after all.  Charlotte Lattimer is senior policy and engagement adviser at Development Initiatives.

Neither he nor his family knew it, and wouldn\u2019t for several years yet, but he was suffering from a genetic disorder. His optic nerves had been damaged and he had lost his sight overnight. He was three. Hassan and his family lived in a small village in Pakistan, outside Multan. No one there really knew what to do with a little blind boy. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Hassan says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d He didn\u2019t go to school, didn\u2019t study at all. \u201cMy daily routine was to wake up and walk around the shops on my own, visit people\u2019s houses. And that was it,\u201d he says. Hassan learned to listen. He would often eavesdrop and he heard things he should not have. \u201cPeople used to say to my parents: \u2018What is he going to do when he grows up?\u2019 And I used to wonder. I heard people say: \u2018God forbid, if something happened to his parents he might be out on the street begging.\u2019 But there was nothing I could do because I didn\u2019t understand what had happened.\u201d No one did.   Related: Adil Rashid\u2019s Big Bash stint a success, says England\u2019s Trevor Bayliss    Hassan is 29 now and a key member of England\u2019s visually impaired cricket team. They play with a small plastic ball, stuffed with ball bearings. Hassan is an excellent fielder at short square leg, a job that requires agility, bravery and extraordinary hearing. In blind cricket the bowler has to bounce the ball twice, in either half of the pitch. So it travels low and batsmen play the sweep shot hard and often. Hassan likes to stand close in so he can get underneath the batsman\u2019s skin. When he\u2019s not talking, he\u2019s listening for the ball, waiting. As soon as he hears the shot, he dives to try to intercept it. \u201cYou have to have balls to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ball is hit so hard I\u2019m always getting smashed at short square leg.\u201d He and the rest of the squad have just flown to Adelaide, where they will play eight matches against Australia. He has had to take annual leave from his job with the Thomas Pocklington Trust charity, so he has time to travel and play. Cricket was always there, in the background. Both Hassan\u2019s parents are crazy for the game. Before he went blind Hassan used to carry a little bat with him. After, he would invite friends around to play games in his family\u2019s back yard. \u201cI would never play; it was so I could watch them and listen to them.\u201d He would tuck a rolled-up newspaper into a hole in the wall, then pretend it was a microphone and commentate on their games. \u201cI made a friend from a poor background. He came and they started playing. He said that he wanted to go and get his own bat. He went \u2013 and I knew he was not going to come back.\u201d Later that day, Hassan heard that the boy had died. \u201cHe had decided that we were too rich for him and that he wanted to play cricket with his friends near the lake. He was chasing a ball and he fell in and drowned. After that I hated the game.\u201d Everything changed when Hassan was nine. His younger sister went blind, too, at the very same age as he had done. Hassan\u2019s parents had the medical reports sent to Great Ormond Street hospital. Then they travelled over to talk to the specialists there. The family moved to London in 1995. His father took a job driving a minicab. \u201cIt was a battle,\u201d Hassan says. Hassan had never studied. Did not speak any English. Had never met a white person. \u201cAnd now I was in a land of strangers.\u201d He became even more reclusive. His parents still had no idea what to do with him. Eventually he was sent to Linden Lodge School for the visually impaired, in Wimbledon. \u201cOne day, and I remember this vividly, a teacher wrote my name in braille and said to me: \u2018This is your name.\u2019 I picked it up and I took it home, and I said to my parents: \u2018I\u2019m not going back. Even if the Queen wants me out I\u2019m not going back. I am staying here to study.\u2019 That\u2019s really when my life started.\u201d Soon after, Hassan was twiddling about with the radio on his Walkman and tuned in to Test Match Special. He became addicted to it. \u201cInstead of playing with the kids at lunchtime, I would sit there listening to this strange game that I used to know.\u201d TMS helped him learn English. \u201cBut I never attempted to pick up a bat because I knew I couldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m blind and cricket\u2019s not for blind people.\u201d It was an Australian teacher who taught him otherwise. \u201cHe started playing cricket with us during lunch breaks and after school, and I just thought: \u2018This is amazing.\u2019 It was just with friends, nothing competitive.\u201d The boys were told about a nearby club, Metro, who played blind cricket. Four of them went along for a session. Hassan, too used to being patronised, expected more of the same. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019ll turn up, and it\u2019ll be like school. A bunch of blind boys hitting a ball around and hip hip hooray.\u2019\u201d What Hassan found, instead, was a new world. \u201cI was 17. These guys at the club were 40, 50, 60. I was the youngest by 10 years and I was overawed, hearing their conversations. They had wives, jobs and lives, and I thought: \u2018This is amazing.\u2019\u201d Until then Hassan had never left home on his own. \u201cOne of the cricketers came to pick me up that first week and I said: \u2018Whatever happens, next week I am going to do this on my own. Whatever happens.\u2019 And that\u2019s really how I started to travel on my own.\u201d His family were not comfortable with it. \u201cI think I know why. They were overprotective. It was a scary thought for them. I hadn\u2019t ever even gone out on my own.\u201d He took two catches in his first game. This, he thought, \u201cis crazy\u201d. A year later he was invited to train with England. Hassan says he owes everything he has now \u2013 his England career, his education at Birmingham City University, his job with the trust \u2013 to Metro. \u201cIt is thanks to cricket that I am in this position. It was only because I saw people who were able to live on their own, who were able to hold down good jobs, that I felt able to do it myself. I was emulating them.\u201d England hasn\u2019t been easy. He quit after his first training sessions, couldn\u2019t stand being away from home. He came back in 2006, however, when his friend and mentor Heindrich Swanepoel took over the national captaincy. Hassan made his England debut that year, in a match against Sri Lanka in Colombo. In 2006 he played in the World Cup in Pakistan. England\u2019s second match was against the hosts, in Islamabad. \u201cI fielded really well in that game and I remember one of the Pakistanis said in Urdu: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, keep hitting him hard as you like, they\u2019ve got good hospitals out in England.\u2019 That\u2019s when I realised I was coming into my own.\u201d Back then the England and Wales Cricket Board was not involved in blind cricket. The players had to scratch together the money to play. \u201cI spent the last four or five weeks going around my college collecting sponsorship, buying my own prizes to give out in raffles. Other lads who were in London were standing outside tube stations with guide dogs, shaking buckets. That was the reality of it. If we didn\u2019t raise enough there would be a danger we wouldn\u2019t travel.\u201d They had poor kit and too little of it. Selection was ad hoc, practice infrequent, coaching nonexistent. Hassan dropped out in order to concentrate on studying for his degree. When he came back to play for England again, things were different. The ECB had taken on some of the responsibility for organising the setup. There are 22 teams in the domestic competition and more than 400 players. Then there are the six regional development centres. A pyramid is in place, with the England team at the top. Now England have a nutritionist, a psychologist, a strength and conditioning coach. For the first time in his life, Hassan is doing one-on-one work with a qualified cricket coach. Last year they played India at the Oval. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing that they are investing money in me and the other players.\u201d It\u2019s worth remembering, the next time you read, hear, or make a complaint about having to pay to watch the game on Sky, that this is where some of the money goes. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved so much since the ECB have come in because we have had more coaches, more backroom staff, better venues to train in. I\u2019m a big cricket fan and I would love to see more cricket on terrestrial TV but, actually, if this is what comes out of it, then I\u2019d rather cricket remain on Sky.\u201d It is not only the visually impaired team. The physical disability team have just been to Bangladesh and the learning disability team to Australia. The deaf team are about to go to Dubai. Hassan hopes that one day the blind cricketers will be paid to play. \u201cNot now. I\u2019m not saying I should be paid to go to Australia but in 40 years I want to sit back and know that someone else is.\u201d This isn\u2019t so very far-fetched. Pakistan\u2019s visually impaired team are already professional. \u201cThat\u2019s my dream,\u201d he says. He wants other visually impaired children to have even better opportunities than he did. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can thank the sport enough for what it has done for me.\u201d If you\u2019d like to learn about opportunities to play visually impaired cricket in your area, you can find more information by emailing disabilitycricket@ecb.co.uk, or by visiting www.bcew.co.uk.

It named them as Leila Alaoui and Mahamadi Ou\u00e9draogo. Amnesty said Alaoui, a French-Moroccan photographer, was shot twice, in the leg and chest, and was quickly taken to hospital. She was initially in a stable condition following an operation and was about to be evacuated when she suffered a fatal heart attack. Ou\u00e9draogo \u2013 a father of four who has accompanied Amnesty staff and consultants on missions in the west African country since 2008 \u2013 was killed as he sat in his car.  The two were parked outside the Cappucino cafe, opposite the Hotel Splendid, when the attack occurred on Friday. Alaoui, described by Amnesty as a talented photographer, was on assignment for the group on a project about women\u2019s rights.  The human rights group said: \u201cAmnesty\u2019s absolute priority is to ensure the best possible support for Mahamadi and Leila\u2019s families. The organisation\u2019s representatives are at the hospital liaising with their families, doctors and all necessary officials.\u201d Alaoui, described by Amnesty as a talented photographer, has had her work exhibited globally, including at the Institut du Monde Arabe, Art Dubai and the Maison Europ\u00e9enne de la Photographie in Paris. Her work has also featured in the New York Times and Vogue magazine.  Much of her work has focused on migration and displaced people. In 2013 she organised a photo workshop for young refugees in Rabat with the help of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  In an interview to mark her recent video project \u2018Crossings\u2019, featuring testimonies of migrants crossing the Mediterranean which exhibited last summer in Marrakech, Alaoui told Al Jazeera: \u201cThroughout my adolescence in Morocco, stories of migrants drowning at sea became regular on the news. \u201cIn my eyes, these stories were constant reminders of deep-rooted social injustice. My French-Moroccan identity gave me the privilege of crossing borders freely while others couldn\u2019t. \u201cWhen I turned 18, I moved to the United States and became even more exposed to questions of belonging and identity construction. I developed strong interests in ethnic minorities, sub-cultures, and marginalised groups. \u201cThis strengthened my conviction to develop my own style and voice, using photography, video art and social activism.\u201d Born in Paris in 1982, she studied photography at the City University of New York before spending time in Morocco and Lebanon. Her personal website says that her work \u201cexplores the construction of identity and cultural diversity, often through the prism of the migration stories that intersect the contemporary Mediterranean.\u201d  French culture minister Fleur Pellerin tweeted that she was \u201cshocked\u201d at news of the death of Alaoui, whom she described as \u201cyoung and talented\u201d.

France\u2019s foreign office has demanded a full inquiry. \u201cDespite the treatment she [Alaoui] was given, the state of her health suddenly worsened during a medical evacuation that was in the process of being organised,\u201d a ministry spokesman said. Twenty-nine people died in the attack on the five-floor hotel. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), an offshoot of the Islamic extremist group, said it carried out the attack. On Tuesday the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said three assailants were still being sought for their role in the attacks. \u201cOf the six assailants, three were killed and three others were being sought,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intention was to hurt foreigners. It is a place where you find a lot of foreigners. That explains why they attacked it,\u201d the security minister, Simon Compaor\u00e9, told Reuters. After nine hours, the three attackers were cornered in the nearby Bush Taxi restaurant. They fired on a troop carrier at the crossroads before a machine gunner in the vehicle\u2019s turret shot them dead. AQIM said the militants had enough time to make a phone call to the group to report there were \u201cmany Crusaders dead\u201d.

A Facebook page called Djibo soutient Dr Ken Elliot (Djibo supports Dr Ken Elliot) has attracted many comments calling for the couple\u2019s release.

Hotel Splendid is sometimes used by French troops with Operation Barkhane, a force based in Chad set up to combat Islamist militants across the vast Sahel region. This is understood to be the first time militants have targeted Ouagadougou.  Burkina Faso has been in turmoil since its longtime president was ousted in a popular uprising in late 2014.

Alaradi was arrested in the middle of the night nearly three months earlier, pulled from a Dubai hotel where he, his wife and children were staying on a trip to see extended family. A father and son, the Libyan American dual citizens Kamal and Mohammed al-Darat were arrested that same month. Like Alaradi, they have been charged with supporting terrorism. Canadian and US officials attended the hearing but their respective embassies did not respond to requests for comment.   Related: Canadian family pleads for father detained in the UAE: 'torture until I wished for death'    The four detainees, all businessmen, have denied that they ever supported the two militias, the Libyan Dawn and the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, which formed during the 2011 revolution. The latter sided with the post-revolution government, but both pro-Islamist groups have splintered in the wake of Libya\u2019s increasingly fractious civil war. The defendants have had limited access to their lawyers, according to Alaradi\u2019s Canadian attorney, Paul Champ. Alaradi\u2019s brother, Mohamad, who was detained for four months, also alleges that they both suffered torture and human rights violations such as detention without charges. Alaradi\u2019s 17-year-old daughter, Marwa, told the Guardian that Monday\u2019s hearing lasted about 20 minutes. She said that her father rolled up his sleeves during the hearing to show the court bruises along his arms, consistent with the beatings and electric shocks her uncle described to the Guardian in an interview last year. \u201cThe judge told him his concerns would not be heard right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe the UAE was avoiding a trial because my father was severely tortured, and he could not be presented in the public because his bruises would put the UAE in a predicament as torture is a grave human rights violation.\u201d The fourth defendant is a Libyan national named Essa al Manna. Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have condemned the treatment of Alaradi and the others and called for their release. Last June, the UN special rapporteur for justice, Gabriela Knaul, reported that Emirati authorities have in the past violated the right to a fair trial and their international obligation to investigate torture. A year earlier she concluded that the courts act as an arm of the ruling royal family. Emirati authorities cracked down on protests almost immediately after revolutionary movements stirred in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in 2011. The country intensified its war on dissenters when the Egyptian military ousted the Muslim Brotherhood from power in 2013. When Libya devolved into a chaotic civil war, the governments in Cairo, Abu Dhabi and other Gulf states began an extended intervention. In 2014 the UAE banned dozens of groups, including the Islamic State, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council of American-Islamic Relations \u2013 a US-based civil rights group \u2013 designating them all terrorists. \u201cMy father is a victim of UAE meddling in Libyan affairs,\u201d Alaradi\u2019s daughter said. She and human rights activists say Alaradi was likely swept up in the Emirati security service\u2019s pursuit of anyone who might help them influence events in Libya.  Alaradi denies any involvement in Libyan affairs, though he supported the revolution and one of his brothers briefly sat on the internationally recognized National Transitional Council. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange, to be honest, how it\u2019s all unfolded,\u201d said Shazi Arshad, campaign manager of the UK-based International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd way for a country to behave.\u201d Arshad said Emirati authorities are \u201ctrying to ensure that people don\u2019t rise up and claim democracy and their human rights\u201d, and that they have chosen to do so with a \u201ccrackdown on a multilevel surface\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no clearcut reason why they picked up these businessmen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely they were picked up because they have links to Libya, businesses and holdings in Libya, and therefore they\u2019re seen as a legitimate target.\u201d The Alaradi family has had to rely on local UAE lawyers to keep them informed of their father\u2019s condition as they wait at home in Windsor, Ontario. Like Alaradi, the al-Darats have lived in the west \u2013 in their case, California \u2013 for most of the past 30 years but retained business ties to the UAE. Alaradi\u2019s wife was briefly allowed to visit him last year in prison.  This article was amended on 19 January 2016 to clarify the charges against the businessmen.

Golden Horn, the Derby and Arc winner, had just finished a close second in the Turf, while American Pharoah, already the first Triple Crown winner for 37 years, was about to be saddled for the Classic. That, however, was as close as they ever got on a racecourse and so it was left to racing\u2019s international panel of handicappers to determine which of the two was the outstanding horse in a memorable year. When their decision was published on Tuesday, it was emphatic. American Pharoah, with a final rating of 134, was 4lb clear of Golden Horn, who was in turn another 4lb ahead of Treve, the Arc winner in 2013 and 2014. Shared Belief, who died of colic in December, was a second US-trained horse in the top three, rated the equal of Treve on 126.   Related: American Pharoah in spectacular Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic win at Keeneland    Some, perhaps many, racing fans, in Europe in particular, may disagree or point out that American Pharoah, like all but a tiny handful of US-trained horses, raced on the controversial anti-bleeding medication Lasix throughout his career. Yet the scale of his achievement in becoming the 12th Triple Crown winner is undeniable while the form of his final and most impressive success, in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic was franked a few weeks later when Effinex, the six-and-a-half-length runner-up, took the Grade One Clark Handicap. Nor is there any doubt that, between them, American Pharoah and Golden Horn dominated racing on either side of the Atlantic. American Pharoah recorded three of the top five individual performances of 2015, in the Classic (134), the Haskell Invitational (130) and the Belmont Stakes (129), while Golden Horn, in the Derby and Eclipse (both 130), was responsible for the other two. Treve\u2019s easy win in the Prix Vermeille (126) the only other victory in Europe rated above 125 Ahmed Zayat, Bob Baffert and Victor Espinoza, respectively the owner, trainer and jockey of American Pharoah, were all present at a ceremony in London on Tuesday to see their colt named the Longines World\u2019s Best Racehorse for 2015. \u201cNot only was he brilliant on the racetrack, he connected with everyone in America,\u201d Zayat said. \u201cFor 37 years, we were waiting for a horse like that and he was finally the one. What I want everyone to remember about American Pharoah is not only was he majestic and brilliant in the way he raced and how much he liked winning the way he did, [it] is how much he was the people\u2019s horse.\u201d Baffert said that American Pharoah \u201cwas the kind of horse who was unique and I could let him do that and share him; and to me that was fun. I was his trainer but I was also a big fan. It was so uplifting for the people of America.\u201d Epinoza, meanwhile, summed up the Triple Crown winner very simply. \u201cEvery time I sat on him, it was like I was in the clouds.\u201d At a press conference which followed the publication of both the international classifications and Europe\u2019s juvenile rankings, Phil Smith, the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s senior handicapper, paid tribute to the talent and consistency of both American Pharoah and Golden Horn. \u201cThey both kept their form remarkably well,\u201d Smith said. \u201cGolden Horn raced in four different countries, though he didn\u2019t quite log as many miles [in the air] as American Pharoah. Looking back at his form in the Derby, it really worked out this year, as the second horse, Jack Hobbs, went on to win [the Derby] in Ireland. It was as good as his performance shortly afterwards in the Eclipse,\u201d said Smith \u201cAmerican Pharoah was the champion in three categories [eight to nine furlongs, 10 furlongs and 12 furlongs] and Golden Horn was the champion in two.\u201d There was never a realistic chance that American Pharoah and Golden Horn would meet on the track, or race on as four-year-olds given their immense value as stallions. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that more three-year-olds don\u2019t stay in training,\u201d Phil Smith, the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s senior handicapper said later, at a press conference following the publication of both the international classifications and Europe\u2019s juvenile rankings. \u201cIf you look at Frankel, he was rated 126 as a two-year-old, 136 as a three-year-old and 140 as a four-year-old. Who is to say how far those horses could have gone? \u201cAs a racing enthusiast, I\u2019d love to see more of these horses kept in training, not just for European racing but for world racing. American Pharoah\u2019s last performance was his best performance, so who can say he would not have progressed ever further at four if he was still improving?\u201d   Related: Geoff Banks\u2019 action against BHA in Speculative Bid case will go to court    The outstanding three-year-old prospect for the Flat season ahead is Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Air Force Blue, who became the first horse to complete a treble in the Phoenix Stakes, the National Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes and was 2015\u2019s champion juvenile on a mark of 124. His rating is the joint-highest of the last five years alongside Dawn Approach, who took the 2,000 Guineas and St James\u2019s Palace Stakes as a three-year-old. In all, only three juveniles \u2013 Frankel, New Approach and Dream Ahead \u2013 have earned a higher rating in the last 12 years, and all were Group One winners at three. \u201cThere have been only four or five two-year-olds in recent years who were good enough to win three Group Ones in the season,\u201d Mark Bird, the handicapper responsible for Irish juveniles, said, \u201cso he is in good company with the likes of Arazi and Zafonic and more recently, Fasliyev and Johannesburg. \u201c[But] there are no guarantees as to what he may or may not achieve as a three-year-old.

To the right of King Salman bin Abdulaziz is his nephew, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef \u2013 middle-aged and bespectacled. To the monarch\u2019s left sits his favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman, the youthful deputy crown prince. \u201cWe pledge allegiance to our wise leadership,\u201d declares the Arabic slogan under the portrait. All three men are wearing traditional ghoutra headdresses and flowing robes. It is a standard declaration of public loyalty to the Saudi royal family as it marks the end of a turbulent year since King Salman came to the throne. Significant change has come to the kingdom, its neighbourhood and the wider Middle East. Collapsing oil prices, war in Yemen, the US tilt towards Iran, sectarian tensions and the rampaging jihadis of Islamic State have all left their mark. \u201cSaudi Arabia is more assertive, less predictable, and probably more nervous than it was,\u201d says a Riyadh-based diplomat. \u201cWe are seeing surprising moves.\u201d     The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, right, welcomes the Saudi defence minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, at the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris in June. Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images     Salman, now 80, will be the last of the sons of King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the founder of the country that bears his family\u2019s name, to use the title Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques \u2013 a reference to Mecca and Medina. The choice of Bin Nayef as crown prince last spring means that power will finally pass to the next generation.  But in recent months it is Bin Salman \u2013 defence minister as well as economic supremo \u2013 who has been making headlines: leading the Yemen campaign and initiating reforms to cope with a ballooning budget deficit and the end of the oil age and, some suggest, the autocratic rentier state it sustained.  The 30-year old is as tall as his revered grandfather, but chubbier; when their images were morphed together they went viral on social media. He is attracting enthusiasm at home and attention abroad. Born in 1985, he is close to the median age in Saudi Arabia. \u201cHe actually knows what PlayStation is,\u201d says a middle-aged admirer, with a laugh, and who, like many interviewed, does not wish to be named.  Efficiency, innovation and independence are the watchwords of a carefully managed public relations campaign that slips easily into sycophancy in Saudi media coverage. \u201cPeople who are normally very critical are all singing the same song,\u201d says a veteran foreign observer. Still, not everyone is convinced. \u201cYes, he is smart, but he has too much power and not enough experience, and that worries people,\u201d says a female Saudi academic.     A Saudi woman attends a book fair in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images     And transparency is still in short supply. Gossip about the monarchy is amplified by Twitter, used by more Saudis per capita than any other people in the world. Rumours and allegations about excesses, corruption and infighting, mostly made anonymously, are impossible to verify, though Riyadh\u2019s chattering classes have heard them all. \u201cThere are certainly princes who are afraid of Bin Salman\u2019s power,\u201d says the diplomat. \u201cThey are distancing themselves so he will get the blame if things go wrong.\u201d  Resentment at royal wealth and privilege is easy enough to observe even in casual conversation \u2013 for example about the high price of land being bought up from princes to build the Riyadh metro, a huge infrastructure project that disrupts traffic and gridlocks the centre of the sprawling capital. \u201cThe Al Saud are the best of the worst,\u201d says a middle-aged government employee. \u201cThere are 40,000 of them. But without them it would be like Yemen here.\u201d The vicious war next door, launched last March, is widely seen as a matter of self-defence, though there is unease about its enormous cost and duration.   Conventional wisdom is that the ruling family will never fall on its sword because the history of the Al Saud and their rivals, riven by conflict, has driven home the lesson that internecine strife must be avoided. \u201cIt is normal in all families to have disagreements,\u201d argues Talal Rizk, a banker. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with the Al Saud but you can see that they respect each other.\u201d     France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, left, speaks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as he arrives in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in October. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images     Bin Nayef, 56 \u2013 \u201cthe man who holds the country together\u201d in the colloquial Arabic expression \u2013 remains popular, not least because he defeated al-Qaida when Osama bin Laden\u2019s followers were at their most dangerous a decade ago. Western governments, anxious to maintain counter-terrorist cooperation, like him too.  But his young deputy is stealing his thunder \u2013 spectacularly. Saudis speculate quietly that King Salman may eventually abdicate in favour of his son and bypass Bin Nayef, who has no sons of his own. The precedent was established last year when the king removed his half-brother Prince Muqrin and appointed Bin Nayef crown prince. It is a grand title, but clearly no longer a job for life.   Al Saud family tree    Saudis scorn foreigners who are fascinated by the machinations of their secretive rulers. \u201cYou love this stuff in the west, it\u2019s like the Thousand and One Nights and Game of Thrones,\u201d says a young intellectual, with a laugh. But most believe that self-interest will keep the family together. And predictions of the kingdom\u2019s demise \u2013 through internal strife, crisis or bankruptcy \u2013 have been around since its foundation in 1932. So far the doom-mongers, including wishful-thinking opponents of the monarchy, have been proved wrong.  Not everyone is persuaded by the brave new vibe emanating from Riyadh\u2019s palaces. Repression is said to have increased in the last year, though no figures are available. Critics are reluctant to speak out. And the palpable sense of excitement is qualified by awareness of the limits of change. \u201cThis country is at a turning point,\u201d says Mohammed al-Zulfa, a historian and former member of the Majlis al-Shura (consultative council). \u201cWe have a new generation that expects a lot from the government. The government wants to meet the needs of the people \u2013 but there is still resistance from the religious establishment.\u201d     Men sitting outside a coffee shop in the Atturaif district on the outskirts of Riyadh, which is part of a major development project shepherded by King Salman. Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images     Salman\u2019s predecessor Abdullah, promoted the advancement of women and higher education, confronted powerful ulema (religious scholars), and tested the foundational bargain struck with them by his father, Ibn Saud. But the present king, who was governor of Riyadh for decades, has always been close to the clergy. And there is more at stake than the absence of cinemas and other leisure opportunities that drive hordes of Saudis to spent their weekends in Dubai or Bahrain where they can relax, drink alcohol and live less austerely. Bin Salman\u2019s ambitions for developing tourism on the pristine Red Sea coast are unlikely to go down well either.  \u201cReligious opposition to reform helped create Daesh [Islamic State],\u201d Mazen Sudairi, a businessman, says bluntly. Ahmed al-Issa, the education minister \u2013 who has written a book criticising school curriculums - is credited with an effort to loosen the grip of ultra-conservative Wahhabis. Still, one of Salman\u2019s first acts was to replace Abdullah\u2019s choice to head the body that runs the religious police \u2013 known as the Haya \u2013 with a more hardline figure. Displays of \u201cover-zealous conduct\u201d have been dealt with, said Prince Turki al-Faisal, a senior royal and former intelligence chief. \u201cBut no Saudi ruler will ever abandon or disband the Haya,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt is an essential part and parcel of sharia law.\u201d  Nor do signs of change extend to capital punishment. Salman\u2019s first year on the throne saw a record number of executions \u2013 including recently of 43 convicted al-Qaida terrorists and the dissident Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, who was portrayed by the government as a violent and sectarian subversive. These judicial killings were widely supported as necessary to deter Isis and Iran \u2013 seen as the kingdom\u2019s most dangerous enemies.     Bahraini protesters hold placards bearing portraits of prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr during protests against his execution by Saudi authorities. Photograph: Mohammed Al-Shaikh/AFP/Getty Images     Saudis often complain that their country is misunderstood and misrepresented by the international media. But there is a realisation in some quarters that improving understanding needs more than slick PR. Its appalling reputation for human rights abuses has been reinforced by the cases of the free-thinking blogger, Raif Badawi, sentenced to be flogged, and the Palestinian poet Ashraf Fayadh, who is facing death for the crime of \u201capostasy\u201d. Friends believe he is being punished for posting a video online showing the religious police in Abha lashing a man in public.  Liberals are dismayed. \u201cIt\u2019s so damaging, and for nothing,\u201d sighs one. Yet few blame King Salman or \u201cthe two Mohammeds\u201d, or question their \u201cwise leadership\u201d. Instead, they point the finger at intolerant judges seeking to advertise the rigours of sharia law. \u201cBadawi is a bone thrown by our government to appease the conservatives,\u201d says a Jeddah businessman who insists on anonymity to spell out this sensitive point publicly. \u201cExtremists they kill.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2016.

Compton\u2019s main contribution to England\u2019s series victory came in the first Test in Durban, with 350 of the 629 runs scored by Alastair Cook\u2019s side coming during the nine hours and 15 minutes he spent at the crease patiently accumulating scores of 85 and 49. But since the aftermath of that 241-run win, when Bayliss spoke of his tactical preference, the 32-year-old has appeared more skittish, with 86 runs across four innings including a second-ball duck when attempting to finish off the win at the Wanderers with a six.

If I were not contributing there might be a case to alter my style but, the way I\u2019m going about things, I\u2019m quite clear that if I do that properly I\u2019ll be doing my job for the side. \u201cIt would be nice to whack it like David Warner or AB de Villiers but having tried different things as a youngster I\u2019m settled in what I do and I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve given teams.

Having returned to the team after two and a half years out, Compton is happy to have played a part in England\u2019s first series win over South Africa in 11 years but admitted runs at SuperSport Park would further his claims for retention in the long term. Compton added: \u201cWhen I came back to the side my goals were pretty clear: one, I wanted to contribute to the team in every way possible and two, I wanted to earn the respect of my team-mates. Anything else above that was a bonus. \u201cThere\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve been frustrated at how I\u2019ve got out and not kicking on but generally my processes and the way I\u2019ve gone about it I\u2019ve been pleased with.

Finn\u2019s replacement for the limited-overs fixtures that follow, Liam Plunkett, is now a fitness doubt himself, however, after a thigh strain ruled him out of a five-wicket win for the Lions over Pakistan A in Dubai on Wednesday.

South Africa, meanwhile, will ring the changes after releasing the wicketkeeper Dane Vilas, fast bowler Hardus Viljoen and batsman Rilee Rossouw from the squad.

Austerity nostalgia announces itself in san serif fonts. It glories in the stripped-down design of the underground network and the homely experimentalism of the GPO film unit. Its influence is observable in fashion (\u201cfor men, moustaches and beards, sensible utility wear; for women, the semi-ironic sexualised style usually called \u2018burlesque\u2019\u201d) and in music (the folksy, whimsical jangling of Mumford &amp; Sons). In cuisine, its spirit is embodied by Jamie Oliver, with his commitment to a cockney-Orwellian interpretation of hearty English grub, and his deliberate appropriation of the institutional trappings of postwar bureaucracy \u2013 both paternalistic and nurturing \u2013 in the Ministry of Food TV series and chain of shops. \u201cOne could argue\u201d, and Hatherley does, \u201cthat he was the latest in a long line of middle-class people lecturing the lower orders on their choice of nutrition, part of an immense construction of grotesque neo-Victorian snobbery.\u201d The central image of austerity nostalgia is the \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d poster, the ubiquity of which over the past few years gives Hatherley the \u201chorror-film-like feeling that I was being chased wherever I went by an implacable enemy\u201d. It feels like an irreconcilably mixed bag of cultural artefacts, but Hatherley does a good job of arguing for the essential similarity of their origins. Born of an anxiety over where we are now, such objects betray a misplaced nostalgia for the aesthetics \u2013 but not the politics \u2013 of the recent past. According to Hatherley, austerity nostalgia informs political narrative. Both \u201cRed Tories\u201d and \u201cBlue Labour\u201d activists, the latter led by Jon Cruddas and Maurice Glasman, have woven these symbols of nostalgia into a retrospective vision of English radicalism in an attempt to appeal to that chimerical entity, the English \u201cwhite working class\u201d. Cruddas\u2019s proposal for the establishment of an English parliament to be based in York, the anthem of which would be \u201cJerusalem\u201d, was, according to Hatherley, simply one of many attempts to rejuvenate the left by constructing an image of historical common-sense solidarity that never truly existed. \u201cThe wager is that we can,\u201d he writes, \u201cjust by tapping into our own history, find a real popular radicalism that resonates with ordinary people, rather than with small groups of intellectuals discussing Fully Automated Luxury Communism.\u201d The book ends with the chapter, \u201cBuilding the Austerity City\u201d, in which Hatherley interprets recent developments in London architecture through the lens of austerity nostalgia. In doing so he identifies a \u201cnew typology\u201d of building: the \u201caustere luxury flat, the tasteful 50s-style modernist non-dom investment\u201d. Gone are the gaudy, festooned developments of early noughties regeneration schemes. Instead, London is peppered with sober, well-made, monumental developments (the vast buildings going up around King\u2019s Cross are primary exhibits) that echo the vernacular of mid-century modernism while \u2013 with their poor doors and astronomical \u201caffordable\u201d prices \u2013 retaining none of its utopian potential. \u201cWhereas in very recent memory,\u201d Hatherley writes, \u201cLondon seemed to want to look like Dubai-on\u2011Thames, it now increasingly resembles a cross between Islington in the 1820s and Poplar in the 1950s.\u201d   Related: Keep Calm and Carry On \u2013 the sinister message behind the slogan that seduced the nation    In tracing these cultural and political artefacts, and the built landscape in which they exist, Hatherley is seeking to describe what the cultural critic Raymond Williams called a \u201cstructure of feeling\u201d: \u201cwhere austerity\u2019s look, its historical syncretism, its rejection of the real human advances of the postwar era had seeped into the consciousness of people who would, when pressed, probably be in opposition to it, even as they performed its aesthetics.\u201d Once we romanticised our lost industrial past, and the loft warehouse flat was the aspirational pad du jour; now we romanticise a lost ideological past, all the while ignoring ongoing attacks on its real institutional legacies. We neglect the NHS because we cannot buy its products. \u201cIn Britain today,\u201d Hatherley writes, \u201cwe are living through exactly the kind of housing crisis for which council housing was invented in the first place, at exactly the same time as we\u2019re alternately fetishising and privatising its remnants.\u201d As Hatherley is the first to acknowledge, he has done a lot to contribute to this state of affairs: as a vocal and convincing champion of a certain kind of postwar utopian architecture, he has helped to make the council estates of east London look inviting to a generation of young hipsters. Hatherley is one of the finest \u2013 and surely the most provocative \u2013 architectural writer we have, and he is at his best here when he focuses on the built environment. Less convincing, because too homogenising, are his readings of the other arts. He offers hardly any literary examples of austerity nostalgia, and there is a curious belatedness to those he does include. He spends a great deal of energy close-reading Alexandra Harris\u2019s 2010 book Romantic Moderns, which argued for a revisioning of English modern \u2013 if not modernist \u2013 aesthetics as a form of spilt romanticism, dedicating the bulk of a chapter to debunking what he calls Harris\u2019s \u201cart-historical adjunct to the Ravilious print, the Mumford &amp; Sons record and the Keep Calm and Carry On tea towel\u201d, which is, he says, \u201cin many ways more dangerous\u201d than any of these.     Hatherley says austerity nostalgia is observable in the \u2018folksy, whimsical jangling\u2019 of Mumford &amp; Sons. Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for Bonnaroo Arts and Music Festival    Indeed, The Ministry of Nostalgia\u2019s great strength \u2013 its clear-eyed, self-confident certainty \u2013 is also its most frustrating quality. Hatherley is committed to a fairly monolithic notion of what modernism was, and what it represented. \u201cWhat, Alexandra Harris asks, if modernism wasn\u2019t really about the transformation of space, the destruction of slums and their replacement with something better for the working class, the overcoming of the 19th century and its physical legacy \u2013 but instead an upper-class movement about the rediscovery of roots?\u201d But what if it was neither? Or both? Hatherley ignores the fact that some flavours of modernism, particularly those associated with literature and the visual arts, were backward-looking and politically conservative. Take TS Eliot\u2019s description of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cmythic method\u201d, which, Eliot said, used the classical past to give \u201ca shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility that is contemporary history\u201d. For many writers and artists, nostalgia was modernism. Nevertheless, the big question asked by Hatherley here is an important one \u2013 and overall he asks it well \u2013 does the left now have something to conserve? Should radical socialism renege on its commitment to progressiveness and attempt merely to keep alive those small scraps of the postwar consensus \u2013 the NHS, comprehensive education \u2013 that do still survive? \u201cIf a social and democratic city is going to be built again, it will most probably be built by those who have no investment in the past, no fond memory of it,\u201d Hatherley concludes. But the sad fact is that the green shoots of dissent he does identify as possible solutions to the impasse of austerity nostalgia \u2013 the people of Derby Road in Southampton refusing to take part in the television programme Immigration Street; the student protests of 2011; the \u201cFocus E15 Mums\u201d who occupied disused council flats, supported by Russell Brand (the prancing prince of austerity nostalgia who, curiously, goes unmentioned by Hatherley) \u2013 hardly add up to much of a countermovement. One wonders what he made of Assemble winning the Turner prize. This is, nevertheless, a lively and gleefully argumentative book. Even when you disagree with Hatherley, he remains interesting. And there is a good chance, depressingly, that he is right about everything. \u2022 To order The Ministry of Nostalgia for \u00a311.99 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Hekmati, a US marine who was freed in a complex prisoner exchange with Iran last week, arrived at Flint\u2019s Bishop international airport on Thursday afternoon alongside his sisters and brother-in-law. He was greeted on the tarmac by his young nephew and niece, a group of veterans and a crush of reporters eager to know what the young man planned to do with his freedom.  \u201cHappy to be home,\u201d Hekmati, 32, told reporters as snow fell on the tarmac. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long road. It\u2019s been a very long journey, and unfortunately many people have traveled this road with me.\u201d He thanked everyone who fought for his release, from the president to local citizens to his brothers in arms. \u201cI\u2019m standing here healthy, tall and with my head held high,\u201d he said, before being escorted away from the media\u2019s glare. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be here and I appreciate everyone\u2019s support once again.\u201d Hekmati was picked up by Iranian security officials in August 2011, two weeks after arriving in Tehran from Dubai on a family visit. Iran\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus are generally suspicious of dual citizens like Hekmati. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to death for spying. Iran\u2019s supreme court annulled the death sentence after Hekmati appealed, ordering a retrial in 2012. The country\u2019s Revolutionary Court then overturned his conviction for espionage, instead charging him with \u201ccooperating with hostile governments\u201d and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. Hekmati was released last week, alongside other Americans including Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, Christian minister Saeed Abedini and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari. A fifth American, a language student, Matt Trevithick, was also released but was not part of the exchange deal. \u201cI am learning more about the grassroots support I received from ordinary people from across the world over the past 4 1/2 years,\u201d Hekmati said in statement on Wednesday. \u201cI wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you have done to keep my name apart of the conversation and for the kindness and support that you have given my family during the darkest period of our lives.\u201d Before landing in the US, Hekmati was taken to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for treatment.  In a press conference outside the hospital on Tuesday, Hekmati said freedom is \u201clike being born again\u201d and said he felt \u201calive for the first time\u201d in many years.  \u201cI was at a point where I had just sort of accepted the fact that I would be spending 10 years in prison, and so this is, it was a surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel extremely blessed.\u201d While Hekmati was in prison, his father, a former university professor, was diagnosed with brain cancer and placed on hospice care. In a interview from August, Hekmati\u2019s sister, Sarah, said her brother was deeply worried he would never see their father again.

As the December deadline for submissions approached, they crisscrossed the country holding on to nearly finished plans and proposals for the cities they had been assigned just two months earlier.  Their documents evoked those familiar, romantic overtures of urban development: constant electricity and an endless flow of water, cyclists with their own avenues, renewed rivers and promenades for families to enjoy each evening, and streetlights that sensed when they were needed. The effects would be felt far beyond the limited geography of each smart city, the consultants thought.  Pashim Tiwari, an urban planner working with the All India Institute of Local Self-Government, was among those who sensed change. The 98-year-old organisation had been assigned two prospective smart cities in the state of Haryana, and two in Chhattisgarh. Tiwari was in charge of the projects. With barely two weeks left until the deadline, he knew his way around government offices \u2013 armed guards would step aside when he approached the cabins of powerful officials. When the team\u2019s senior members went home now and then, their wives would reintroduce them to their children. The extreme pressure of the two-month deadline engendered a rare spirit of cooperation. Legions of city officials were free to find obscure information the planners required. \u201cCity managers have become more aware of their cities. Most weren\u2019t aware of the strengths and weaknesses \u2013 now, for the first time, this kind of thinking is getting institutionalised,\u201d Tiwari said thoughtfully one morning in Bilaspur, one of the two smart city prospects in Chhattisgarh. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before.\u201d     \u2018They\u2019ve ignored this place for so long ...\u2019 Bilaspur is one of the two smart city prospects in Chhattisgarh. Photograph: Mint/Hindustan Times via Getty Images    Outside, a roundabout dedicated to Jawaharlal Nehru wore political hoardings concealing India\u2019s first prime minister, and tinny speakers broadcast instrumental music from the 1950s. Wires \u2013 electrical, cables \u2013 hung over the low buildings like unruly hair. Store owners swept rubbish into piles left on the streets, and cows gathered around the biggest mounds. The town\u2019s pavement designs were a choice left to building owners.  Tiwari had arrived in Bilaspur from New Delhi early that December morning, wearing a sweater. The temperature outside was 30C. His eyes were glassy, and his cough was in no way helped by the coal dust carried into the city by slow winds. At the town\u2019s municipal headquarters, Tiwari spent his waking hours creating the town\u2019s smart city proposal with a team of young planners. \u201cThey aren\u2019t jaded by city policies yet,\u201d he grinned.  Bilaspur\u2019s municipal commissioner had vacated a conference room for this youthful team. Other than a few sofas and coffee tables cloistered in one corner, the room was bereft of fixtures, but thousands of questionnaires were stacked along one wall. Tiwari explained that more than 70 \u201curban local bodies\u201d (arms of government responsible for civic works) had conducted 35,000 detailed interviews for this single proposal.     Part of Bilaspur\u2019s smart city plan    Citizens had been asked to rate the government\u2019s accessibility, the town\u2019s cleanliness, broadband penetration, mobile connectivity, sewerage, and safety and security on a scale of one to five. Tiwari asked for a sample from the file. The respondent had suggested, in a mix of Hindi and English, \u201ca separate lane for emergency vehicles so that lives can be saved\u201d. Asked which part of the city they wanted rejuvenated for the smart cities project, a substantial number of people mentioned the Arpa river around which the town had grown. Because citizens wanted it, the planners\u2019 proposal would focus on the river. The whole smart cities endeavour, after all, was about what the citizens of India wanted. Tiwari believes that smart cities could fix the problems of regular cities. \u201cThe city can now run as a public limited company,\u201d he said, happily. \u201cWhen you look at a city that way, the moment the valuation increases, municipal bonds become a reality. I\u2019ll give you an example: city surveillance is amazingly viable in larger towns. If you have houses paying a small amount, you could have enough cameras to have an effective city surveillance network. And not one handled by the government, but by private companies.\u201d Like every other consultant vying for the government\u2019s approval, Tiwari had followed the rules and was preparing two plans for each of his cities. One detailed the ideas and budgets for a small area within the city; the other was an invisible technological grid laid over the entire city. Tiwari\u2019s team proposed a bespoke, city-wide digital operating system: \u201cIt will have electricity, water, healthcare, birth-death, credit card data, traffic licensing, penalties,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a city official, if dengue season is approaching, you\u2019ll get alerts reminding you that you have to put out particular tenders.\u201d Tiwari believes that, eventually, everybody will come to see the benefit of living in a \u201csmart area\u201d, and be willing to pay for it. He described a world where all the city\u2019s residents, from slum residents to the occupants of penthouses, could use services online \u2013 where electrical connections were easy to procure, and all kinds of payments could be made by phone or at a kiosk. A world of blissful information technology. \u201cWe realised that even in slums, people will pay nominally more for improved services. [With our system] everyone is able to access any resource if he is able to pay for it. Every citizen has the opportunity to access data for his survival and upliftment.\u201d     A model at the Smartcity Expo in New Delhi. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images    A mile or two east of Bilaspur\u2019s municipal headquarters, at the banks of the Arpa river, are where the trash returns to town. I walked there the day after meeting Tiwari and saw a boy who was squatting behind a mound of trash, scoop up handfuls of acrid water to rinse himself. Cannonballing children leapt off a pipe jutting above the river\u2019s surface. On the administration\u2019s side of the river, where nicer buildings are located, a woman in a burkha came down the bank, passing pigs and an immobile drunk. She hitched up the hem of her clothing, and trod carefully on a submerged path through the treacly stream. The full details of the new city plan were still unknown to residents of Bilaspur, but as often happens, the more ominous parts were beginning to leak out. Tiwari said that land around the river would be acquired for the smart city. In exchange, residents would receive another plot nearby: a third of the size of the land they gave up, but according to him, worth much more with the knock-on effects of the smart city. \u201cIt is quite lucrative for people to give.\u201d \u201cDuring Indira Gandhi\u2019s time, they promised us a bridge here,\u201d said a man living beside the river, who declined to give his name. \u201cThey\u2019ve ignored this place for so long, and now we\u2019ve heard they\u2019re breaking everything.\u201d As he spoke, a boy rode up on a bicycle, wearing only red underwear. He stopped at the river\u2019s edge and stared across, chewing a small red rag. \u201cLook at this addict,\u201d the man said, as the boy turned to go. \u201cSmell his rag.\u201d The cloth the boy was chewing reeked of turpentine. \u201cLook at his chest \u2013 it will curve inward. All this will go inside him and his insides will get stuck. He will die before he is 24.\u201d The boy, aged 14, nodded his head in agreement; he looked like he wanted someone to find him a place in the world. Then he mounted his cycle, rode it into the river, and fell off.  Making a smart city In February 2015, the Indian government announced that Bloomberg Philanthropies, the urban-focused charitable foundation set up by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, was to help the Ministry of Urban Development develop a means of identifying Indian cities that could be made \u201csmarter\u201d. Through Bloomberg\u2019s connections, local officials could reach out to experts elsewhere.    City managers have become more aware of their cities. Most weren\u2019t aware of the strengths and weaknesses  Pashim Tiwari     \u201cThis approach is different,\u201d the government\u2019s release said. \u201cIt will ensure that real citizen engagement happens, as people get involved both in design and execution of city development plans.\u201d  Each competing city had official webpages on a government-run website, where citizens were asked what kind of smart city they desired. The responses included working streetlights, better roads, regular garbage collection \u2013 the stuff of regular civic life.  Bloomberg Philanthropies has said its aims would include giving \u201clocal officials \u2026 broad flexibility to develop approaches\u201d that answered local needs. A Bloomberg video explains: \u201cSmart cities are about clustering smart people, smart institutions, and creating an economic model that can evolve with time.\u201d Last August, a shortlist of 98 cities was announced. Before the end of January, the first 20 winners of the smart city challenge will be revealed. A further 40 smart cities will be chosen the following year, and 40 more will follow the year after. Together, they will draw on the $100m funds from the smart city programme over five years. The funding will increase substantially with matching funds from each state, and other government schemes to utilise. But greater than this competition is the pull of history: smart cities have long been imagined, but never defined. To help create the model, technology companies have forged smart city agreements, hosted smart city conferences, and arranged smart city meetings. In Bilaspur, Cisco said it would charge the town \u00a32.6m for an information and communication technology platform. In addition, the planners had budgeted \u00a36.7m to lay broadband fibre. Meetings were arranged with Siemens. \u201cEven Google\u2019s getting into smart cities,\u201d said one planner.     How the \u2018Aerotropolis\u2019 at Durgapur, West Bengal, might look. As of now, it consists of a runway, a terminal, and roads surrounded by fields. Photograph: Townland    Elsewhere, Microsoft, Ashoka University and the Indian School of Business have begun a \u201cventure accelerator programme\u201d focused on smart city solutions. Dheeraj Batra, who heads the business school\u2019s incubator, said the accelerator would take a \u201cvery broad approach\u201d to smart cities. Asked why the school decided to focus on smart cities instead of regular ones, Batra said: \u201cHonestly, the smart cities idea gives these startups a better chance at success.\u201d To create the proposals, cities signed up a raft of international consultants: McKinsey &amp; Company, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Indian firms Infosys and Tata, and Aecom, a consultancy conglomerate whose revenues doubled from the previous year to $18bn in 2015. Cautionary stories circulated: in one of the largest corporate settlements in Australia, for example, Aecom settled for $201m for exaggerated traffic forecasts for a failed toll road.  There are others, such as \u201cAerotropolis\u201d, a sprawling real-estate project in West Bengal marketed as India\u2019s first airport metropolis. As of now, it consists of a runway, a terminal, and roads surrounded by fields. Townland, the international consultancy (with headquarters in Hong Kong) behind Aerotropolis, is now one of the official consultants for Tiruchirappalli, a city in Tamil Nadu which is also known as Trichy. At a mandatory hearing with local stakeholders, the consultants were viewed as outsiders who couldn\u2019t come to terms with this culture of the ancient temple town.    If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai, it will be a gated community  Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan     Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan, a local architect, was disapproving: \u201cI don\u2019t think a consultant coming from outside can draw a plan for Trichy in the next 10 or 20 years. They\u2019re totally unfamiliar with the nuances and identity of the place. They\u2019re not able to tell the difference between Trichy and [the neighbouring city of] Madhurai. They asked me what made Trichy unique,\u201d he said, seemingly a breath away from adding: \u201cthe heathens\u201d.  Sengottuvelan agreed to be interviewed soon after a smart city consultation with citizens had been held. \u201cThey said the city will have IT companies,\u201d he explained.  At the meeting, he and other stakeholders worried about the proposal. \u201cWe said that the identity of the city should be respected; that whatever development has to happen should focus on strengthening these identities, rather than making every city the same. If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai \u2026 it will be a gated community.\u201d The proposal for Tiruchirappalli was less gated community, more a weird mix of marketing speak and emotional pandering. Residents were promised \u201cenhanced last-mile connectivity\u201d, an \u201cintegrated bus stand with sky walk\u201d, digital signage, \u201cemployment opportunity for [the] economically weaker section\u201d, and health monitoring apps \u201cespecially for pregnant ladies\u201d.     Wired city: chaotic electricity cables in Old Delhi. Photograph: Arkaprava Ghosh/Barcroft India    But Sengottuvelan believed that the public hearings, a crucial part of the smart city challenge, were a facade: \u201cThe hearings give a false impression that things are transparent.\u201d He believed the agenda for smart cities had already been set, and the exercise was about the application of information technology for benefits that were unclear.  \u201cAs stakeholders, we know what the city lacks. But in their presentation, they said that technology would be used to stop electricity theft, and there will be CCTV on the streets, and they were talking about an app that tells you where parking is available.\u201d The thought left him cold. \u201cMy suspicion is that they have already developed technology, and are looking for a place where they can sell it en masse.\u201d  The decision process The question about technology\u2019s dominance in smart cities is surely the tip of a deeper concern: who decides what a city\u2019s priorities should be? In 1992, an amendment to India\u2019s constitution devolved power to city governments. People affected by city life, the thinking went, should have a say in city affairs. The urban ministry\u2019s approach to smart cities swings the other way. \u201cThe cities programme nudges us toward information technology, rather than local government,\u201d said Pavan Srinath, the head of policy research at the Takshashila Institution. Sensing that the mission to create smart cities was an important moment in urban governance, Srinath has led the thinktank\u2019s study of the endeavour from 2014: \u201cYou have to ask, is the smart cities mission furthering local government, or putting a spanner in it? \u201cI think, for a city like New York, where problems have been solved, putting sensors on sewage pipes is a wonderful idea. For India ... \u201d his voice trailed off, leaving scepticism to fill the void. \u201cI think what the conversation needs to be about is what is smart for your city, for your area.\u201d    Related: Delhi Mumbai Corridor: how the world's largest infrastructure project is uprooting Indian farmers    The planners and architects I met, who initially saw the smart cities programme as an opportunity to examine the deficiencies of existing cities, also feared the course it seemed to be taking. \u201cWe have the opportunity to not make mistakes,\u201d Biju Kuriakose, a Chennai architect, said. \u201cBut you have an American in Indonesia as the consultant for Trichy. The logic is, they know smart cities. But consultants look at cities with a spreadsheet, and walk around with their 10 bullet points about sustainability.\u201d In Raipur, a two-hour drive from Bilaspur, in a mouldy room at the district headquarters, the consultants frowned at their spreadsheets; the numbers were startlingly small. A junior planner, one of the group\u2019s workhorses, read out the cost of touchscreen kiosks and his manager, a senior planner, smiled. \u201c35,000 rupees for a touch display is not possible. It\u2019s at least 600,000 rupees.\u201d Tiwari stretched out on a chair, conserving his energy for later presentations. These final days of the bidding process involved winning the approval of the people most likely to be affected by the smart cities programme: government employees. The next meeting was two hours away. \u201cEveryone is creating their own platform,\u201d Tiwari said. \u201cCisco is, Microsoft is, IBM is, Infosys is. The question is, who is going to deliver the right mix? The trick is not technology so much as understanding the regulatory system and the user system, and then creating middleware in a manner that can integrate both of them with appropriate technology.\u201d  Tiwari said the organisation he worked for hoped to lay a fibre network and leave the very last stretch, the part that reached homes and offices, open to whatever technology people adopted. \u201cThe network will belong to the governing company. If any private company has an application they want to put on it, we\u2019ll ask them to pay an access charge.\u201d Tiwari\u2019s phone kept buzzing in the silence. He answered every call. On a wall behind the planners, a diagram consisting of clouds and arrows reminded them that technology, energy, people and the economy were bound to each other.  Tiwari is comfortable with technology\u2019s complexities. \u201cI had access to tech a long time ago. Always. Others did too, but they weren\u2019t enamoured by it. We had a BBC Micro in college.\u201d He was fascinated by the Raspberry Pi, and said that the openness of his smart city system would allow citizens to plug in devices such as the Pi for their own use. The vision was appealing: the city as a programmable device.     The humble smart city planning office in Raipur. Photograph: Rahul Bhatia    At a quarter to six, a man stuck his head into the room. \u201cYou can go in now. He\u2019s waiting.\u201d The office of the municipal commissioner, a powerful administrative official, was a floor below. In an enormous room, behind an enormous desk, sat a muscular man no older than 40. He was dressed in a grey shirt and beige jacket. He held documents with one hand, and used the other to smoothe his hair. The plan did not make him happy. Tiwari shifted forward on his chair, eager to respond to any problem the commissioner brought up. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he began, \u201cthe ministry has said that for the pan-city solution, no costs on infrastructure should be incurred. They will only approve websites, information technology. It could be a traffic solution also.\u201d This struck the commissioner as mad, and so inconceivable, that he stuttered: \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? We don\u2019t need information technology here.\u201d An assistant agreed: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe need money for flyovers here ... \u201d \u201cWe need those flyovers,\u201d the assistant repeated. \u201cSir, it\u2019s your party that has done ... \u201d Tiwari interjected, referring to the Smart City Challenge\u2019s driving force, the National Democratic Alliance, which forms India\u2019s present government. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been out on the streets, but we need wider roads, flyovers, proper pathways.\u201d The commissioner scoffed: \u201cHalf these things we don\u2019t understand: \u2018Intelligent traffic solutions \u2026 \u2019\u201d    Related: From Singapore to Amaravati: the battle to build India's new state capital    He put down the proposal. \u201cI wanted something we could implement immediately. I don\u2019t see any of that here. And what you\u2019ve proposed for the smart city area is very difficult. It involves a lot of demolition work.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to give responsibility to a software company. You\u2019ve written that the company will look at traffic violations, number plate registrations, handle the CCTV control room. But all this is the police\u2019s jurisdiction. You\u2019re saying they will do our job. We will have no powers left to enforce anything.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge for everyone, but the system that has been devised is just this,\u201d Tiwari replied, sounding frustrated. \u201cLook at this,\u201d the commissioner continued, engrossed in this vision of an alternate world where his post was irrelevant. \u201cIT tools for automatic speed detection.\u201d He looked at Tiwari, aghast. \u201cThere\u2019s no work for us here.\u201d At the end of the meeting, Tiwari left the enormous room in silence, walked upstairs slowly, and pushed open the door with a \u201csmart cities\u201d printout stuck on it. Briefly, only for an instant, his optimism failed him.  \u201cIt\u2019s been like this,\u201d he said, before catching himself. \u201cIf you look at other countries at a similar stage in their history, we\u2019re doing really well.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion  This article was updated on 26 January to clarify that Townland is an international consultancy with headquarters in Hong Kong ", "title": "'We don't need IT here': the inside story of India\u2019s smart city gold rush", "sentences": ["If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai, it will be a gated community  Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan     Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan, a local architect, was disapproving: \u201cI don\u2019t think a consultant coming from outside can draw a plan for Trichy in the next 10 or 20 years.", "If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai \u2026 it will be a gated community.\u201d The proposal for Tiruchirappalli was less gated community, more a weird mix of marketing speak and emotional pandering."], "publicationDate": "2016-01-22T06:30:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/austerity-saudi-style-cheap-oil-nudges-riyadh-toward-economic-reform", "tags": ["Saudi Arabia", "Oil", "Business", "Commodities", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Global economy", "Economics"], "article": "In the Faisaliyah mall in central Riyadh, the call to midday prayers brings down the shutters on shops selling luxurious global brands and the basement mosque fills up.

Just a few miles from the city centre, near walled royal estates, mothers and children huddle outside over makeshift fires to save electricity and take the chill off a winter\u2019s evening. Poor Saudis, badly educated and ill-equipped to compete with foreign workers, are not a contradiction in terms. An estimated 2 to 4 million of King Salman\u2019s 21 million subjects live beneath the poverty line \u2013 a challenge to every clich\u00e9 about the oil-rich kingdom, and to prospects for future reform.   Salman\u2019s first year on the throne saw oil prices drop to below $35 a barrel, and even if they recover longterm, demand is shifting. The growing scale of shale oil production in the US is a major factor. Iran\u2019s re-entry into the market after the lifting of sanctions related to its suspected nuclear weapons programme will also boost an existing supply glut. Mohammed is right. The conflict in Yemen is reportedly costing $6bn a month and shows no sign of ending any time soon. By any reasonable assessment, leaner times lie ahead. \u201cIt was OK when you could throw money at a problem,\u201d muses Hisham Alhegelan, the CEO of a solar energy company. \u201cBut when you have to start counting the pennies, the pennies matter.\u201d Austerity, Saudi-style, means the wealthy are talking about emptying their swimming pools, swapping gas-guzzling SUVs for something greener and even turning off the air conditioning when they travel abroad.     An estimated 2 to 4 million Saudis live beneath the poverty line. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images     Change is being driven by the king\u2019s ambitious and powerful son, the deputy crown prince and defence minister, Mohammed bin Salman. The idea is to raise non-oil revenue without hindering competitiveness and causing unrest. \u201cEveryone used to say subsidies were a political taboo and that if you increased the price of water, gasoline and electricity there would be revolution,\u201d says John Sfakianakis, a Greek economist who has advised the Saudi government. \u201cWell, people are not out in the streets, but that doesn\u2019t mean the government will be complacent and forget about the average citizen.\u201d   After years of over-spending, the 2016 budget bears the stamp of Bin Salman\u2019s quest for innovation. There is also rare transparency, including the revelation that military and security expenditure makes up 25% of the total. Talk is rife of improved governance and the use of key performance indicators to monitor a multi-year strategy of the kind employed by Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Ministers have come and gone with unusual speed, generating wry jokes about brisker management style.    Related: Saudi Aramco \u2013 the $10tn mystery at the heart of the Gulf state     News that even the state oil behemoth Saudi Aramco may be sold off has underlined the scale of an effort that will include an increase in the private provision of healthcare and education. The word khaskhasa, Arabic for privatisation, is being bandied around. Vast tracts of land could be up for grabs, along with lucrative untapped mineral resources. Tackling corruption and job creation are also being highlighted. None of these ideas are new. Subsidy reform has been discussed for years and VAT came up in 2012, but Salman\u2019s predecessor, King Abdullah, then still raking in healthy oil revenues, vetoed it. Now a sales tax is on the way, by agreement with the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. So are \u201csin\u201d taxes on fizzy drinks, which may help to tackle the country\u2019s obesity problem. Further subsidy cuts seem certain. Key details are expected with the publication of a heavily flagged \u201cnational transformation plan\u201d, drawn up with the help of McKinsey and other blue-chip consultants. \u201cWith some tweaking they can do a lot to raise revenue from non-oil sources and use it to invest and pay salaries,\u201d says Sfakianakis. \u201cThey can\u2019t let themselves believe that one day oil prices will rise again and the Saudi economy will recuperate. They don\u2019t want to let luck or Allah decide their future.\u201d  Saudis recognise the universal truth that economic reform will have political consequences. \u201cPeople will expect something in return,\u201d says the historian Mohammed Al Zulfa, a veteran of the appointed Majlis al-Shura or consultative council. \u201cThe government takes all the oil revenue, and there is huge government expenditure. But if Aramco does go to the private sector and you introduce taxes, people will ask \u2018what\u2019s in it for me?\u2019      Shoppers at the al-Hayatt mall in Riyadh. Photograph: Fahad Shadeed/Reuters    \u201cIf the king says the Majlis al-Shura has the authority to question ministers or check the budget, then maybe things will be different. But unfortunately our society is not ready for that. Saudi education does not promote the right to participate. We need more time.\u201d  The view that change needs to be slow and cautious appears to be widely shared. \u201cNo one talks about income tax so the representation-taxation equation is inapplicable in the Saudi case,\u201d argues Saud al-Tamamy, a political scientist at King Saud University. \u201cAnd the word representation has a different meaning here.\u201d    Related: Saudi Arabia and Isis: Riyadh keen to show it is tackling terror threat     If there is to be greater public participation in decision-making it is likely to be incremental, agrees Haifa al-Hababi, a Riyadh architect who stood in the recent municipal elections \u2013 the first time Saudi women were allowed to vote. Failure to win a seat has not deterred her, and she is already demanding more accountability from her local council. \u201cIn Saudi Arabia and the Gulf we are selfish,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what people get from the government. We treat the government as a father who must look after us. Prince Mohammed is doing what Thatcher did in Britain. That is a part of the solution, though it is not just an economic problem but a political one too.\u201d  Saudi dissidents, some of them Muslim Brotherhood sympathisers who call for constitutional monarchy, are behind bars, intimidated into silence or in exile, so it is hard to gauge the level of support for far-reaching change. Democracy is not discussed on the street, and the elite appear to have no interest in it.  The maximum that seems likely is \u201cthe habit-forming effect\u201d of limited political participation rather than any \u201cgrand departures\u201d, in the words of one academic expert. \u201cWhy would you want representation if you have a good standard of living and the government is responsive?\u201d asks Alhegelan. \u201cIf we were a democracy I don\u2019t think I\u2019d live here because it would be dominated by fundamentalists. Look around the countries that were autocracies and tried to be democracies and are now in ruins. That was the Arab spring.

My fear is that she\u2019s behind the door, dreading my arrival. I\u2019m thinking how difficult it will be for her to go over the grooming and murder of her son Breck yet again \u2013 and how difficult it must be to talk about Murder Games, a BBC documentary that unpicks each turn of the case, with interviews, analysis and sinister re-enactments.  Very soon, though, Lorin curled up by the fire sipping tea in a silent house, I realise that recounting how her eldest child was lured to his death is no more or less difficult than anything else \u2013 getting up each morning, shopping, attending parents\u2019 evening with her remaining three children. \u201cIt\u2019s all equally hard and I kind of dread everything,\u201d she says.  \u201cI do these things \u2013 I do everything in a robotic way, forcing my body when, really, I\u2019d rather sit and hide and disappear because the pain this has caused is just too deep.\u201d Murder Games is a hard programme to watch, harrowing beyond belief, but probably essential viewing for all teenagers, and teenage boys in particular. To be shown on BBC3, it will come with website links, access to advice and information on internet safety. There has also been a separate screening for teachers and charity workers via BBC Learning and BBC Outreach. \u201cThe reason I agreed to the programme is that I can\u2019t bear to have lost the most precious thing to me for nothing,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cI want everyone to understand the dangers.\u201d     Breck Bednar.    Lorin\u2019s story starts with a son who, like so many other boys, loved gaming. Breck was born in 1999 \u2013 his American parents, Lorin and Barry, had come to the UK two years before for Barry\u2019s work as an oil trader. Two years later, their triplets were born \u2013 Carly, Chloe and Sebastian, now 14. Though Barry and Lorin separated in 2006, Barry remained close, having the children every other weekend. \u201cFrom the start, Breck loved fixing things, taking them apart, putting them together,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cAt school, Breck wasn\u2019t with the footballers, he wasn\u2019t competitive. He was in the \u2018Lego gang\u2019 \u2013 a little group who made rockets and guns and ran around playing out little fantasies.\u201d Later, computers drew him in. \u201cHe dismantled and rebuilt them,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy the set-up he had. He was very resourceful, saving birthday and Christmas money, selling and exchanging parts.\u201d Though Breck excelled in school and was an A* student, Lorin describes him as chilled. \u201cHe never yelled, swore, slammed the door. He\u2019d come home, get his homework done, his chores out of the way, then go online.\u201d Online, Breck would game. At 14, he was invited into an online gaming group \u2013 a \u2018virtual clubhouse\u2019 \u2013 by school friends. \u201cBreck\u2019s bedroom door was always open and he\u2019d sit, with headphones on,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cThere was a gaming screen where they might be on a battlefield, a screen with icons for the boys who were online and another screen for live messaging, with images or music or YouTube clips \u2013 whatever they were talking about. \u201cI have to say, I\u2019d rather sit and talk face to face but I could see why they liked it. It was very interactive, social. I could hear everything they were saying \u2013 I loved hearing Breck\u2019s laugh \u2013 and there was nothing very sinister.\u201d Except for one thing \u2013 the ringmaster, whose server they played on. While the other members were known to Breck or his friends, Lewis Daynes was not someone they knew in real life. He claimed to be a 17-year-old computer engineer running a multimillion pound company. Sometimes he was in New York, working for the US government. Other times, he was in Dubai, or off to Syria. \u201cTo Breck, who still had his baby teeth and saw no evil in the world, Daynes seemed very cool, very exciting,\u201d says Lorin. When Lorin walked into Breck\u2019s room, he\u2019d say, \u201cMy mum\u2019s come in.\u201d While the other boys would go quiet \u2013 a mum is enough to silence most teenage boys, Daynes would say, \u2018Hey, Mum!\u2019 and start some banter. When she\u2019d just returned from a dance class, he\u2019d send a dancing lady across the screen. \u201cI might ask what was going on in New York, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Not a lot \u2026\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d ask why he wasn\u2019t out with friends on a Friday night and he\u2019d say he was too tired. My fear was that he was some 40-year-old paedophile sitting in his underpants.\u201d As the months passed, Dayne\u2019s presence loomed larger. \u201cI\u2019d get a lot of \u2018Lewis says \u2026\u2019,\u201d Lorin says. \u201c\u2018Lewis says I don\u2019t need to finish school as he can get me a Microsoft apprenticeship when I turn 16.\u2019 \u2018Lewis says as I don\u2019t drink or smoke and do well in school, I should be allowed to game as long as I want \u2026\u2019\u201d It became harder to get Breck offline, to do his homework or his chores. (\u201cLewis says I shouldn\u2019t have to do chores as it\u2019s the triplets who make the mess.\u201d) When Lorin walked into Breck\u2019s room, Daynes now sent images of wicked witches or goose-stepping Hitlers on screen. \u201cI\u2019d be telling Breck to get offline and he\u2019d literally have Dayne\u2019s voice in his earphones telling him not to listen. I could see Breck\u2019s face, torn between me or his cool mentor who had the whole world going for him.\u201d Lorin believes if it was a daughter enthralled by an online stranger, she would have been taken more seriously. \u201cI worked as a teaching assistant, I asked staff, teachers, other parents and not one person thought it sounded dangerous,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what boys do.\u2019 Or \u2018My son was a gamer \u2013 he grew out of it.\u2019\u201d Both Lorin and Barry offered to take Breck to meet Daynes. \u201cI wanted him to not show up and prove he wasn\u2019t who he claimed to be, but Daynes wouldn\u2019t. He was too busy with \u2018important work\u2019.\u201d In December 2013, Lorin could take no more. \u201cI knew I needed to do something so I did the biggest thing I could and dialled the police on 101. I told the call handler what I\u2019d heard, what I feared. She obviously didn\u2019t understand online grooming. She asked if Breck could just play on another website or if I could ask Lewis not to contact my son again. If it was that easy, I\u2019d have done it! I gave her Lewis Dayne\u2019s full name and his county \u2013 and by the end, I honestly believed he\u2019d be checked in the Police National Computer.\u201d     Lorin and Breck.    Had this happened, police would have seen that Lorin had good reason to be afraid. Lewis Daynes had led a troubled life \u2013 his parents had divorced, his mother had left the country, he\u2019d spent time in the care of his grandmother and his local authority. Now 18, he was unemployed, living alone in an Essex flat where he bought server space and used it to game with teenage boys. In 2011, he\u2019d been accused of raping a boy and possessing indecent images, though he was not charged. \u201cIn my dream life, the police look him up, then come and tell Breck who Daynes really is,\u201d says Lorin. Instead, she heard nothing. She confiscated Breck\u2019s computer equipment and organised a meeting with Barry, Breck, another boy from the gaming group and his parents where they set out their suspicions. But Daynes was one step ahead. He couriered a phone to Breck so they could communicate and persuaded Breck to record the meeting about him so he knew what was said. \u201cFrom then on, he knew we were on to him,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cIt sent everything underground.\u201d Realising that time was running out, police have now established that Daynes began to claim he was ill and dying \u2013 too weak to run his company. He\u2019d decided to hand it over to Breck, if Breck could come to his flat in Essex and learn how to take it over. It\u2019s not the grooming we associate with girls and predatory paedophiles, nor the kind we warn our children to watch for. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t sexting,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cPolice didn\u2019t find a single image or text about bodies or sex. Breck thought their relationship was about technology and computers.\u201d Daynes, meanwhile, was out buying duct tape and condoms. On Sunday 16 February 2014, Breck took a \u00a3100 taxi ride to Daynes\u2019s home (Daynes paid). It was the start of half term and he was staying with his father, but told him he was going to his friend Tom\u2019s to build a new server. Later, he texted to ask if he could stay the night there. What happened in Daynes\u2019s flat is still unknown. \u201cUnfortunately, you do try to imagine,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cAt some point, the tables turned and Breck must have thought, oh my God, my mum was right \u2013 and it would have been too late. My heart breaks to think how scared he must have been to be tied up and gagged and stabbed by someone he trusted so much.\u201d Dayne\u2019s utterly calm, utterly chilling 999 call on the Monday morning is played on the opening of Murder Games. \u201cMy friend and I got into an altercation \u2026 and I\u2019m the only one who came out alive.\u201d Barry and Lorin\u2019s life now crossed into the realms of a horror flick. Daynes had cut Breck\u2019s throat, photographed his body and sent the image to other members of the gaming group. The news quickly spread between phones to reach Breck\u2019s siblings just as police were informing their father. Daynes later pleaded guilty to murder with sexual and sadistic motivation and was sentenced to life imprisonment. \u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible,\u201d says Lorin. \u201cI have to carry on for the other children, but I\u2019ve aged 100 years. The triplets lost their youth. They went from 12 to teen, from \u2018yay, happy, poopoo\u2019 to \u2018duct tape, murder, stabbing\u2019. I didn\u2019t know Daynes was a murderer but I knew he was dangerous. All I\u2019d done with police, with other parents, with Breck, all the rules I\u2019d had, the talking we did \u2026 it all failed.\u201d Before the funeral, while they were still waiting for Breck\u2019s body to be released, Lorin decided to set up the Breck Foundation to raise awareness on internet safety. She speaks at schools, conferences, to parents and police. \u201cWhen I was worried about Breck, no one I turned to understood or knew what I should do,\u201d she says. \u201cBoys may report this less but I want everyone to understand that they can be groomed and hurt \u2013 maybe not murdered but hurt in other ways \u2013 by people who are not who they say they are online. I want police to understand what grooming is so that when a parent calls with a name, it will go into the system. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than thinking you could have saved your child and didn\u2019t. I cannot bear for another family to go through this.\u201d \u2022 Murder Games: The Life and Death of Breck Bednar is on BBC3 on 26 January, 9pm.

At the beginning, the gaming seemed like fantastic fun \u2013 when Breck first showed me I thought it was the coolest thing. And for Breck, it wasn\u2019t just the games. He built his own computers, he was into coding, he was passionate about technology. It turned horrible very fast. Lorin and I were separated but I\u2019d always seen a lot of Breck. We were very close. We talked all the time \u2013 even when he was playing that crazy game, he\u2019d always get off when I called. He\u2019d game when he was at my house too. I\u2019d hear Daynes\u2019s voice but Daynes never talked to me the way he talked to Lorin, maybe because I\u2019m a man. I was worried, though. I knew his stories were outlandish. No 17-year-old would be running a major consulting firm, working for the US defence. Like Lorin, I thought he might be a paedophile and I told Breck that if he wanted to keeping talking to this guy, I needed to meet him first. I offered to go along with Breck to meet Daynes but that never materialised. By the December before Breck was murdered, I was worried enough to move back from London to be very close. I had the children for half term and when Breck told me he was going to see a friend, I was happy that he was doing something that wasn\u2019t online. Later, when he texted to say he wanted to stay the night, that they\u2019d ordered pizza, I was still happy. We really don\u2019t know if Breck sent the text himself or what happened that day or evening. I can only hope that, at first, he did have fun. I\u2019ve been to Daynes\u2019s flat \u2013 it\u2019s a dump. But perhaps, to a 14-year-old, this place with no parents was great. There\u2019s no word for the impact except devastating. One thing that gets me through is seeing families like the McCanns, or the parents of Milly Dowler who was missing for six months before her body was found. At least we know where Breck is. We know the person who killed him and he\u2019s in jail. As a parent you\u2019re supposed to look after your child. We knew there was a problem but still Breck was murdered. If the police had looked Daynes up and told Breck that he wasn\u2019t who he claimed to be, that probably would have stopped everything. I believe that if Breck had been a girl, we\u2019d have been taken more seriously.\u201d Online grooming: What you need to know A new friendship or relationship may not appear to be about sex \u2013 there may be no sexual references as the groomer builds the relationship. It might not make your child uncomfortable, so it can be hard to recognise that they are being groomed. Breck enjoyed his relationship with Daynes. It may take others to spot what is really going on \u2013 perhaps another teenager worried that a friend is being controlled. Maybe that teenager confides in a parent. That parent isn\u2019t sure whether to intervene. Young people should be on their guard not just for themselves but for other children. Act on concerns by telling a parent or teacher. If you are worried that a child or young person is being groomed online, report it to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. All reports are reviewed by child protection social workers. The Child sex offender disclosure scheme (Sarah\u2019s Law) allows the public to check whether people in contact with their children have a criminal record for child sex offences.

England are in good nick having recently beaten South Africa, the current champions, by 125 runs in Dubai, where Callum Taylor, scored 78 from 88 balls. The competition has often showcased future stars. That includes Virat Kohli who led India to the title in 2008 and, more recently, Kagiso Rabada who was in the South Africa side that won in 2014 and who has proved so promising for the Proteas this winter. Coverage begins with the opening match Bangladesh v South Africa (Sky Sports 2, Wednesday, 2.30am); it clashes with England\u2019s first match against Fiji so their first televised encounter against West Indies is on Friday (Sky Sports 2, 2.30am).

The team, their development and journey to Lord\u2019s is told alongside their bid to end Female Genital Mutilation in their community. Brought together by cricket, the players are young and willing to challenge their elders. It is a difficult subject handled well. The film received limited cinema release at the beginning of the month and continues to have screenings across the country (warriorsfilm.co.uk) is out on Monday on DVD. NETBALL SUPER SATURDAY Fair play to Sky for giving netball the full Premier League treatment right down to the \u201csuper\u201d prefix. The new Vitality Superleague Season begins on Saturday with all eight franchises in action on the same day at the Genting Arena in Birmingham and all four games are televised (Sky Sports 2, from 1.30pm).

Andargachew Tsege was given the death penalty at a trial held in his absence six years ago, in contravention of international law. A prominent figure in an Ethiopian opposition party, he disappeared in June 2014 during a stopover in Yemen while travelling from Dubai to Eritrea, in what campaigners regard as a politically motivated kidnapping. He was then illegally rendered to Ethiopia on the command of the Ethiopian government, as part of a crackdown on dissidents and civil rights activists. Speaking ahead of Foreign Office minister James Duddridge\u2019s arrival on Wednesday in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for the annual African Union summit, Tsege\u2019s partner, Yemi Hailemariam, from north London, said she felt betrayed by the UK government\u2019s apparent indifference. Foreign Office officials, however, have yet to learn whether they will even be granted a meeting with Ethiopia to raise Tsege\u2019s case. \u201cSince Andy disappeared in June 2014 our family has been living a nightmare,\u201d said Hailemariam. \u201cMy children are desperate to see their father again. Andy believed in democracy above all \u2013 that\u2019s what he respected about Britain, and it\u2019s what he hoped for in Ethiopia. He was sentenced to death for holding these very British values \u2013 we simply can\u2019t understand why the government he believed in isn\u2019t standing up for him.\u201d It is now 18 months since Tsege was put in jail and UK ministers have yet to request the 60-year-old\u2019s release. Letters to the Tsege\u2019s lawyers indicate that Duddridge believes the father of three from Islington should appeal his conviction through the Ethiopian courts, a stance his family fear reveals that the UK government has accepted the validity of Tsege\u2019s conviction. Despite being pressed last week on whether its position had changed, the Foreign Office remains unmoved. By contrast, the European Parliament cranked up the pressure on Ethiopia last Thursday, passing a resolution demanding the country release Tsege \u201cimmediately\u201d. Tsege, who fled the country in the 1970s and sought asylum in the UK in 1979, has been unable to contact a lawyer since his arrest, and his family have similarly been blocked from seeing him. A redacted transcript from a 30-minute meeting on December 26 last year between Tsege and a British official allowed to visit him apperared to confirm he is effectively a \u201cghost prisoner\u201d. The transcript states: \u201cHe [Tsege] had been told there was a problem in that he \u2018wasn\u2019t in the system and hadn\u2019t been given a prisoner number\u2019. He was also denied other rights that other prisoners enjoyed such as watching TV, listening to the radio and reading newspapers.\u201d It added: \u201cHe didn\u2019t even know who was really responsible for him \u2013 he\u2019d written to ask but hadn\u2019t received a response yet.\u201d Maya Foa, the head of Reprieve\u2019s death penalty team, said the time had come for the Foreign Office to abandon soft diplmacy and call for the Briton\u2019s release. She said: \u201cTsege has been subjected to an outrageous, unlawful ordeal, and if the Foreign Office disagrees, it must explain why. \u201cIt is unacceptable that a British citizen was sentenced to death in a political show trial \u2013 where he wasn\u2019t present, and didn\u2019t even know about the court proceedings \u2013 and then kidnapped into indefinite detention by the same brutal regime. It\u2019s clear that there is no hope of \u2018due process\u2019 in Ethiopia\u2019s courts, and that Andy\u2019s very wellbeing is at stake.\u201d A psychological analysis of Tsege, based on the transcript from the prison visit suggest his mental state has deteriorated significantly. Dr Ben Robinson, of South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, said the transcipt suggests Tsege may have become suicidal. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe foreign secretary has raised Tsege\u2019s case with the Ethiopian government on 20 separate occasions, making it clear the way he has been treated is unacceptable. We welcome the improvement in access to Tsege, following the British Government\u2019s intervention, but it must be more regular and it must include access to a lawyer. The statement added: \u201cTsege has still not been given an ability to challenge his detention through a legal process.

No team has lost fewer games than Derby, only the top two have a better defensive record and Paul Clement\u2019s squad are the most talented in the division. They have gone four games without a win, but that is a run you would hesitate to even call a blip, particularly since Derby lost only one of their previous 19. On Friday they face Manchester United in a televised FA Cup fourth-round tie \u2013 a game that reeks of a potential upset. So why does the iPro Stadium feel like such a nervous place at the moment? Clement described their 1-1 draw with Reading on 12 January as their worst performance of the season, and the chairman, Mel Morris, was moved to visit the dressing room to tick the players off in the most strident terms. A proposed warm-weather training trip to Dubai was cancelled, in part because Clement did not believe it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d after such a poor showing.   Related: Birmingham\u2018s Paul Robinson sparks clinical victory at high-flying Derby    All of which did not really leave Derby anywhere to go following last week\u2019s 3-0 defeat by Birmingham, when they were thoroughly outplayed by a side who looked more organised, more threatening and, frankly, more of a team, but who were assembled at a fraction of the cost. And there lies the rub. In the summer Derby spent heartily to augment what had already been the best team in the division for much of the previous 18 months. Nine players, including Darren Bent, Tom Ince, Jason Shackell, Jacob Butterfield and Bradley Johnson, arrived and when the club decided that was not quite enough, Nick Blackman and Abdoul Camara were purchased this month too, taking the total outlay to roughly \u00a325m. This lavish spending was done to prevent a repeat of last season, when the Rams under Steve McClaren looked imperious at the top of the table until the end of February but then collapsed, winning two of their last 13 games to fall out of the play-off places altogether. This somehow managed to eclipse the horror of the previous season, when Derby lost the play-off final to QPR in one of the great muggings of our time, Bobby Zamora\u2019s late goal winning a game dominated by the Rams and providing perhaps the most heartbreaking promotion failure imaginable. Until 12 months later, of course. You can understand why they wanted to really make sure this time. Morris, a Derby fan and local businessman who also holds shares in the company which makes Candy Crush, took over as chairman in the summer and quickly replaced McClaren with the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid coach. It was a gamble in that this is Clement\u2019s first job as a manager, but a highly respected coach guiding a talented squad was surely a recipe not just for success, but a Roman procession to the title. The flip side of this is that the expectation that comes with the high-profile recruits, along with the crippling fear of Derby managing to find another new and interesting way of messing up a seemingly inevitable promotion, means that emotions are heightened and reactions to blips can easily be more extreme. \u201cWe are a team in a bad moment,\u201d said Clement after the defeat to Birmingham, admitting that his side\u2019s confidence was fragile. \u201c[But] I\u2019d certainly rather be going through this bad period now than in March or April.\u201d The other problem with a manager having so many options is that, well, he has so many options. Clement does not appear to know what his best team is, which might not necessarily be a problem in an age where football is more of a squad game than ever, but it does lead to confusing selections. Chris Martin and Butterfield were dropped last Saturday, and while the former has been in poor form (one goal in the last 12, and that from a penalty), the relegation of the latter to the bench seemed strange. Against Reading the balance of the team was altered to include Blackman, straying from the usual 4-3-3 formation and leading to the performance that so irked both manager and chairman. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is a crisis,\u201d said Clement last weekend. \u201cA crisis is when time is running out \u2013 time is not running out.\u201d It\u2019s easy to read too much into these things, but it was interesting that Clement brought up the word \u201ccrisis\u201d unprompted. He was clearly aware the word was lingering in the air, indicating that he is sensitive to the expectation that his side are under. Morris promised at the start of the season that failure to achieve promotion to the Premier League would not result in Clement\u2019s dismissal, but it is hard to think that another shortfall will be tolerated. Indeed, as illogical as it might appear, it would not be a colossal shock if Clement\u2019s position was in danger in the coming weeks, should this blip continue. But the manager knows he can rectify things. \u201cIt\u2019s not about cracking the whip,\u201d said Clement. \u201cWe need to focus on the good things we\u2019ve done this season. We need to be strong, maybe battle out an ugly result to just get that confidence back again so you can then do the stuff that\u2019s more difficult to do. Getting on the ball, being courageous in possession, taking risks in the right areas \u2013 things that we\u2019ve stopped doing.\u201d On Monday night they face Burnley, one of the teams lurking just behind them in the Championship and waiting to capitalise should the \u201cbad moment\u201d continue. In this most highly strung of seasons where Derby\u2019s fear of failure seems to have become more powerful than the hope of success, every game is amplified and more fraught. The rewards are potentially huge, starting with Burnley and then United on Friday.

It did not turn out that way. Instead, the foreign secretary Philip Hammond\u2019s office sent a message that the Scottish delegation was not entitled to hospitality. To avoid embarrassment, Scotland\u2019s former first minister hosted the dinner at his hotel in Tehran, paying for not only himself and his delegation but British embassy staff, too. Salmond, who is the Scottish National party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, is torn between whether the incident is comic or a piece of political vindictiveness on the part of Hammond\u2019s office. Salmond\u2019s treatment contrasts with that of the former prime minister Tony Blair, who was hosted at British embassies in Washington and Paris. The Scottish visit was at the invitation of the Iranian parliament.   Related: The week in radio: The Alex Salmond Phone-In; Word of Mouth; Rethinking Anorexia Nervosa    There is a potential constitutional issue over whether the Foreign Office sees itself playing host exclusively to Westminster delegations, rather than Scottish ones as well. Salmond, who is a member of the Scottish and Westminster parliaments, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a quite serious matter because it indicates the deep politicisation of the Foreign Office under Hammond and his Tory special advisers. The Foreign Office permanent under-secretary should be putting his foot down to make it clear it is the British Foreign Office, not the Tory Foreign Office. \u201cIt is worth noting that, while Foreign Office staff are being prohibited from offering elementary courtesy to a parliamentary delegation from the Westminster and parliaments, including privy councillors and members of the Council of Europe, they have been for years offering bed and board for Tony Blair.\u201d   Related: SNP's defence policies are 'laughable', says Philip Hammond    The Foreign Office said this month that Blair, after revelations in the media about his embassy stays, and other former ministers would not be provided with any assistance for visits unless they were in pursuit of government objectives. Asked specifically about Salmond, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cOverseas posts follow clear guidance on arrangements for visiting parties. Visiting politicians from a single party are offered a general political briefing, but it is not the role of overseas posts to provide hospitality or to arrange meetings unless it is for an official visit on her majesty\u2019s government business. All embassy expenditure is kept under close scrutiny to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer.\u201d During the visit, the six-strong Salmond delegation, which included two SNP members of the Scottish parliament, Azzam Mohammed, vice-chairman of the Muslim Council for Scotland, and two staff, met the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and the speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani. A British embassy team was included in the talks, which featured discussion of the nuclear pact, trade and human rights. Salmond said the British charg\u00e9e d\u2019affaires, Ben Fender, and his staff were helpful and co-operative: his beef was with Hammond\u2019s office. It was only as Salmond and his team were about to fly the last leg from Dubai to Tehran that he was informed that there would be no dinner at the embassy that night. Rather than allow the Iranian government, which was covering the costs, to pick up the tab for the British diplomats, Salmond offered to pay for the hotel dinner.

I love books and I love going to book festivals, both as an author and a reader. So it might come as a surprise to learn that I\u2019ve got together with book blogger Zoe Toft to organise the Think Twice Campaign that encourages authors and illustrators to think twice about appearing at a book festival. Before you think we\u2019ve lost our minds, I should say that we\u2019re only asking authors and illustrators to think twice about going to a particular festival \u2013 the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature that is held every year in Dubai. Lots of authors and illustrators we admire and respect attend the festival each year and it seems to be well organised and very enjoyable for everyone involved. So why are we kicking up a fuss about it? Our objection is to the festival\u2019s sponsor, Emirates Airline, part of an environmentally irresponsible industry and owned by a very oppressive government.     Jonathan Emmett: I hope that the Think Twice Campaign will help many authors and illustrators to see through that smokescreen and think twice about going to this particular book festival. Photograph: PR    Generally speaking, we are in favour of companies sponsoring book festivals to help them cover their costs. However it\u2019s important to recognise that both sides benefit from a sponsorship deal. By associating themselves with high-profile, respectable authors and illustrators, Emirates Airline are able to raise their own profile and make themselves appear more respectable. Zoe and I don\u2019t think that a company like Emirates Airline should be regarded as respectable. We think they are quite the opposite. And we\u2019ve given authors and illustrators three good reasons to think that too. One reason is climate change. While governments are making other industries reduce their CO2 emissions, the aviation industry\u2019s carbon footprint gets bigger and bigger every year. It looked like aviation was finally going to be brought under control at last year\u2019s Climate Change summit in Paris, but at the last minute, they were let off the hook again. Environmental groups have said that the absence of both aviation and shipping from the Paris agreement will make it \u201cclose to impossible\u201d to keep global warming beneath the 2\u00baC level needed to avert climate catastrophe. As the airline that flies the highest number of international kilometres, Emirates Airline\u2019s international flights already generate more CO2 than any other airline and instead of reducing their emissions they have just announced plans to double in size. Does that sound respectable? A second reason is free speech. The airline is owned by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and the book festival\u2019s patron. Dubai is part of a country called the United Arab Emirates or the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed is also the UAE\u2019s Vice President and Prime Minister. The UAE government is very different from the UK\u2019s and the Sheikh is more like a king than a UK prime minister. The UAE is not a democratic country, so the Sheikh cannot be voted out in an election, no matter how unpopular he is with his people. Many UAE citizens are very unhappy with the way the country is run. Unfortunately, citizens that dare to criticise the country\u2019s government are arrested and imprisoned for doing so (find out more in this link from Amnesty International). There are currently 67 prisoners serving long sentences just for speaking out in favour of democracy. Does that sound respectable? The third reason is human rights. If you\u2019re not a rich heterosexual man, you may be treated as a second class citizen \u2013 or, worse still, a criminal \u2013 by Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s government. Attacks against women are not taken as seriously as they are in the UK and often the victim, rather than the man attacking her, ends up being arrested and imprisoned. Homosexuality is illegal and people can be imprisoned for up to 10 years simply for being gay. People of both sexes working in low paid jobs are not protected by the law in the same way that rich people are. Low paid women are especially badly treated, with many being forced to work long hours with little to eat and no days off. Does that sound respectable? Zoe and I do have a lot of sympathy for children that might miss out on meeting an author or illustrator as a result of this campaign. However we have more sympathy for the people \u2013 children and adults \u2013 in the groups whose interests the Think Twice campaign are trying to champion: the women, migrant workers and gay UAE citizens whose human rights are being abused, or the future generations who will have to contend with the life-threatening consequences of climate change.  If authors and illustrators are thinking of cancelling, but are worried about disappointing a young audience, they could offer to Skype with UAE schools. There are lots of tips for authors and illustrators who are new to Skype at virtualauthors.co.uk.  Emirates Airline is an extremely rich company. They use their money to sponsor many other high-profile events and organisations, from football clubs to symphony orchestras. This all helps to create a smokescreen of respectability around a company and a government that is anything but respectable. I hope that the Think Twice Campaign will help many authors and illustrators to see through that smokescreen and think twice about going to this particular book festival.

A spokesman for Amanda Staveley confirmed the existence of the claim but declined to put a figure on the total being sought by the financier and her firm, PCP Capital Partners. However, the Financial Times reported that Staveley is suing for almost \u00a31bn. Staveley, who is using the London law firm Fladgate for the dispute, is believed to be arguing that the bank has not fully paid the fees due to her for setting in motion a crucial investment, said to be worth around \u00a33.5bn, from Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. In the aftermath of the financial crash, Barclays was desperate to bolster its balance sheet to stay out of the hands of the Labour-led UK government. Its share price plunged as a government rescue, as was needed by Lloyds Bank and RBS, became a very real threat. PCP Capital Partners is going ahead with the dispute against Barclays, which will be defended by an entirely new management team to the one embroiled in the controversy in 2008. The claim from PCP is likely to include an element for damages, a source said. According to the Financial Times, Barclays said in a statement: \u201cWe believe the claim against Barclays is misconceived and without merit and Barclays will be vigorously defending it.\u201d Full details of the case are expected to be unveiled in official court documents in 14 days\u2019 time. As well as Staveley\u2019s clients, the bank also attracted investment from a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority. That part of the deal is currently the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Staveley, 42, has always had extensive connections in the Middle East. Born and raised in Yorkshire, she was based in Dubai for several years but has now relocated to London. When asked in a 2011 interview to explain her success in leading deals, she said: \u201cI can see an opportunity or a problem faster than any lawyer. I can see a document and find a hole in it, or I can understand what I can put in to make the contract work.\u201d Staveley has been involved in several high-profile deals throughout her career.

They are through to the FA Cup fifth round, this victory the perfect riposte to last Saturday\u2019s dire 1-0 home defeat by Southampton.   Related: Juan Mata makes the most of his chance to shine and boost Louis van Gaal | Peter Lansley    It was only the result that was perfect, though. The well-documented failings of sluggish play and a quality-deficit under Van Gaal were again evident, at times, as his side struggled to perform from first whistle to last, as they so often seem to. Yet until Stoke City\u2019s visit to Old Trafford on Tuesday, at least, the furore over Van Gaal\u2019s position will be quelled and that, along with being safely in the fifth-round draw, is mission accomplished. For this there is Daley Blind to thank, the Dutchman deployed on this occasion as a central defender making a rare foray into Derby County\u2019s area to finish Jesse Lingard\u2019s cross after 65 minutes for what proved the decisive goal. The second game in this season\u2019s quest to prevent United\u2019s run without lifting this trophy extending to 12 years began with Marouane Fellaini running the ball straight out of play. Van Gaal had voiced hope his players would show the \u201cconfidence of training\u201d because then they would win, he argued. This lack of bullishness on game-day is one major flaw in the Dutchman\u2019s side. Another is the sideways passing and one more is a reluctance to bomb forward at pace. All of these were present in a tame opening and, when United took the lead on 16 minutes, it came via a moment of isolated brilliance from Wayne Rooney. Following a trademark over-patient build-up involving Blind and Anthony Martial, the captain took the ball on the left, cut inside and beat the Derby goalkeeper Scott Carson with a peach of a 20-yard finish that curled sweetly off his right boot for a 13th goal of the season for his club. Rooney may have been offside during the move but United and their travelling support did not care. It had the 5,000 fans who made the trip singing about going to Wembley and gave their side a welcome cushion after the weekend\u2019s travails.   Related: Louis van Gaal looks forward to bottle of wine after win over Derby    An early goal is also the key to the Van Gaal blueprint working its best. Having a lead to protect means the smothering of ball and opponent is done for a tangible reason. And when moving forward there is more invention as the players can relax, as was seen when Rooney and Martial cut through the home defence before the latter shot tamely from close range. The true cost of this miss became evident when Derby equalised as the interval neared. To this point Paul Clement\u2019s side had barely threatened. There was a regulation Cyrus Christie shot for David De Gea to scoop up and a Nick Blackman header into the turf that was as simple to collect for the visiting goalkeeper. There was nothing De Gea could do about George Thorne\u2019s finish, though, as his defence was shredded too easily by Derby. Chris Smalling\u2019s clearing header fell only to Chris Martin and he flipped a pass infield to Thorne, who took a touch and stabbed the ball home expertly to De Gea\u2019s right. Cut to a stony-faced Van Gaal who was surely concerned that confidence might again be drained from his men. And the truth was that United were fortunate to enter the break still level in light of the momentum swing. Juan Mata, handed a rare start at No10, dawdled, was dispossessed and the ball slipped through to Martin only for Smalling\u2019s tackle to save United. Before this Blackman had offered another warning, tearing in from the right and letting fly an attempt that De Gea had to keep an eye on as it went only marginally wide. Van Gaal made two changes from the defeat by Southampton. In came Mata for the dropped Ander Herrera and Guillermo Varela for the injured Matteo Darmian as the teams had walked out to an iPro Stadium filled with flag-waving fans and ticker tape, which gave the tie an old-fashioned feel. As United kicked off the second half the prevailing mood now was of the upset of knocking out the 11-times winners being on. This, surely, would be a result to try even the patience of an Old Trafford hierarchy who seem trenchant in their reluctance to sack Van Gaal. A pattern of play under the Dutchman is a bright start to halves before performance fades. A repeat seemed to be about to occur when Martial raced down the left and flashed the ball across goal in a cross-shot hybrid that came to nothing. Now came the fade, as Clement\u2019s team pinned United back, yet Van Gaal\u2019s side were to rally impressively as the game wore on.

Twice Blackman threatened on the left, the second occasion culminating in him taking aim but then firing the ball just too high to put Derby ahead. If Van Gaal is all about measure and control then as the hour arrived his team had been dragged into a dogfight. But, from here they prospered with the kind of helter-skelter play adored by their support.

It is far from unusual for a guest to find, on arrival in what may be an unknown city, that the host is out of reach by phone, or the apartment looks nothing like the description. Airbnb encourages all its members to be good hosts \u2013 and good guests \u2013 but in the \u201csharing economy\u201d, the onus is on the individual to provide a decent experience. If you\u2019re considering hosting, it\u2019s worth noting that Airbnb has over two million listings in 34,000 cities and 190 countries, so you need to stand out from the crowd. Being a great host \u2013 and getting good reviews \u2013 is a significant part of that.   Related: Airbnb's booming city neighbourhoods    To find out what makes a good host, I attended Airbnb Open in Paris last November. The conference welcomed more than 6,000 hosts from all over the world, including from Cuba, one of the site\u2019s latest additions. Cubans, with their tradition of casas particulares, are somewhat ahead of the curve when it comes to hosting. Many told me that listing their home on Airbnb had given them the economic freedom to pursue their dreams, or allowed them to make many friends and travel the world. Indeed, there was something quite utopian about the way members of the community discussed the Airbnb philosophy. Perhaps it was because so many of them are from California.     Airbnb Open, Paris 2015. Photograph: Thibaut Voisin    One such is Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk, himself a host in San Francisco. It\u2019s important, he told me, to be \u201csuper-responsive\u201d. \u201cOne of my things is to check in with guests the day before they arrive and make sure they have all the information they need. As soon as they\u2019ve arrived, I ask if everything\u2019s OK. If anything does go wrong \u2013 something\u2019s out of place, you\u2019ve run out of toilet paper \u2013 they have a chance to let you know before it bothers them.\u201d    First of all, you have to choose a guest you\u2019re compatible with  Helena Meireles     How your property looks is also, naturally, an important factor. Edma Balestri has three Airbnb properties in Sardinia, and said it was vital to have \u201ca well-organised house\u201d. (This automatically counts me out as a prospective host.) \u201cMake sure there\u2019s nothing missing that guests might want to use,\u201d she advised. \u201cAlso, make sure your house conforms with the description \u2013 people are usually happy as long as this is the case.\u201d Ian Wilkinson from London\u2019s Kensington, meanwhile, emphasised the more personal aspects of hosting: \u201cBeing honest and upfront, and being available \u2013 or having someone else available if you can\u2019t be there \u2013 is important. That\u2019s in the nature of Airbnb, because it\u2019s such a personal experience between host and guest. If you\u2019re at a hotel, you expect someone to be available, but with Airbnb you do it to have that connection between people, so want them to be themselves. If I\u2019m ever a guest I always want to feel as though I\u2019m meeting the person \u2013 even if it\u2019s just talking over the system.\u201d This is why Anton Karlsson, who has a property in Reykjavik, Iceland, makes a point, he told me, of welcoming guests personally, then sits down with them to tell them all about the area and its highlights.     \u2018Make sure the property matches the online description\u2019: A couple arrive at a characterful Airbnb apartment in Berlin. Photograph: Peter Stroh/Alamy    Helena Meireles from Rio de Janeiro agreed: \u201cI always try to provide a welcome package \u2013 a breakfast or a chocolate cake \u2013 and explain the area to them. I have a tip list with the local restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies and so on. And I usually take them out one night for a drink as well. You can become friends: it\u2019s very rewarding.\u201d Meireles also advised hosts to research their guests. \u201cFirst of all, you have to choose a guest you\u2019re compatible with,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like kids, don\u2019t choose a guest who has children. And make sure you find out what their expectations are.\u201d    Whatever people request, always keep in mind that they are coming from a different perspective  Jade Woo     Many of the hosts I met emphasised the importance of empathy. \u201cTreat people the way you would want to be treated as a guest,\u201d said Jade Woo from Toronto. \u201cWhatever people request, always keep in mind that they are coming from a different perspective, a different place, and that it\u2019s interesting to find out what they\u2019re about.\u201d My strong impression from this particular group of hosts was that welcoming guests from all over the world had been a transformative, not to mention emotional, experience.

Georg Friedrich Haas\u2019s Morgen und Abend takes place mainly in the afterlife. The new opera by Thomas Ad\u00e8s, being premiered at this summer\u2019s Salzburg festival, is based on Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s absurdist film The Exterminating Angel. The Scottish partnership of composer Stuart MacRae and novelist Louise Welsh, on their third collaboration, have combined both fantasy and reality with great deftness. Their new opera The Devil Inside, a co-commission between Scottish Opera and Music Theatre Wales, is based on a short story by Robert Louis Stevenson (The Bottle Imp), a pact-with-the-devil tale. A luminous green genie \u2013 in Samal Blak\u2019s clean-lined, minimalist design \u2013 wreaks havoc from within its glass bottle. At the same time two backpackers, now in thrall to the genie, discuss property development, high-rises in Dubai and a condominium in California. Whoever owns the magic bottle will gain untold power. If they die with it in their possession, they face damnation. As a final twist, the bottle can only be sold for less than the price it was bought: as the price drops with each transaction, getting rid of it becomes a finite option.

Surtitles are welcome but almost redundant since each of the four singers \u2013 Richard Sherratt, Ben McAteer (a Scottish Opera emerging artist), Steven Page and Rachel Kelly \u2013 enunciate clearly. They also sing MacRae\u2019s forgiving and conversational vocal style with rigour, and act well under the direction of Matthew Richardson. The excellent 14-strong ensemble of soloists, members of the orchestra of Scottish Opera conducted by Michael Rafferty, easily filled the Theatre Royal\u2019s 1,500-seat auditorium with their beguiling sounds, but the mood of the piece is intimate, intense, disturbing.

Scoring is transparent, quixotic, each strand audible and drawn together like a loose-woven mesh to encompass and support the voices. String players double on harmonicas. Occasionally there are sonic drifts into microtonality but mostly for the genie\u2019s strange, unsettling music. The pairing of tenor trombone with trumpet manages to sound like a full brass section instead of merely two skilled players. Harp and percussion are kept busy. When James (McAteer), the more questioning of the two protagonists, watches an old couple cross the road and ponders the end of life, the strings have a burst of sudden lyricism. Tender episodes such as these offset the brittle tale of the magic bottle and give the piece rewarding depth.     Found and Lost at the Corinthia hotel.

Hall has been artist-in-residence there for a month, the first composer in a scheme now in its fourth year. The drawback is that only a dozen people at a time can watch the hour-long event, since it takes place in lobbies, conference room, boiler room and a guest suite in the luxury hotel, just off Whitehall and once part of the Ministry of Defence.

He\u2019d just done a magnificent book on hunting, he was doing so many things. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t ease up, but I can\u2019t say why, who knows why?\u201d  Veyrat added: \u201cCooking is a high-pressured job. People don\u2019t realise how much. It\u2019s one of the few jobs where one is judged and marked all the time. What other profession would accept being constantly evaluated?\u201d  Pierre Gagnaire, another three-star Michelin chef, who was named by his peers as the \u201cbiggest star chef in the world\u201d and who has restaurants in Paris, London, Tokyo, Dubai, Moscow and Berlin as well as Sketch in London, added: \u201cTerribly sad news for an extremely talented chef.\u201d Paul Bocuse, named \u201cchef of the century\u201d by the food guide Gault et Millau and the Culinary Institute of America, said of Violier: \u201cA grand chef, a grand man, a gigantic talent.\u201d   Fr\u00e9dy Girardet, a friend of Violier and his wife Brigitte, and another three-star titan of Swiss haute cuisine who had previously run the restaurant in Crissier, said he was \u201ccompletely stunned\u201d.  He told the Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve: \u201cI can see no motive for such an act. He was a brilliant young man, with enormous talent and an impressive work potential. He gave the impression of being perfect. This news is so sad.\u201d     Flowers and a note reading \u2018The angels will really enjoy themselves with you ... But I have lost a friend\u2019 outside Beno\u00eet Violier\u2019s restaurant in Crissier. Photograph: Cyril Zingaro/EPA     If it is confirmed that Violier killed himself, he will not be the first to have cracked under the demands of maintaining the gastronomic excellence demanded by powerful restaurant guides such as Michelin and Gault et Millau, customers and the food critics. A Michelin star or three \u2013 the maximum that can be awarded \u2013 or a 20/20 from the Gault et Millau can bring international glory, but the pressure to maintain the rating can be intense.  In 2003, the food world was shocked by the suicide of Bernard Loiseau, 52, a three-star chef who was reportedly distraught about criticism of his restaurant, La C\u00f4te d\u2019Or, in Burgundy, France, and rumours that he would lose his third star. Violier\u2019s death came hours before the French gastronomic bible, the Michelin Red Guide, the oldest European hotel and restaurant guide whose star rating can make or break a restaurant, unveiled its 2016 French edition. Violier had retained his three stars when the latest Swiss edition of the guide was announced in November. Before the ceremony started on Monday, those gathered stood for a minute\u2019s silence in honour of Violier, but there were echoes of the earlier tragedy when it was revealed that Loiseau\u2019s restaurant, run by his wife Dominique since his death 13 years ago, had lost one of its three stars.  Veyrat, who sold one of his establishments, the three-star Auberge de l\u2019Eridan in Annecy, \u201cfor health reasons\u201d and whose restaurant, La Maison du Bois in the French Alps, burned down last March, said he did not blame influential guides such as Michelin for the pressure, suggesting much of it was self-imposed.     Beno\u00eet Violier was found dead at his home on Sunday. Photograph: JG Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my/Rex     \u201cWe are happy to have three stars. I gave up the evaluations and gave back my stars when I opened my last restaurant, but when it reopens I want to go chasing stars again. Because without the evaluations, the guide books, we feel orphaned. We complain about being marked, then we complain when we are not. We chefs are passionate madmen, mad with happiness.\u201d  Violier, the son of a wine grower from the Charente-Maritime departement in south-west France, joined the kitchen team at the Crissier restaurant in 1996. A year later, the chef Philippe Rochat took over the restaurant and in 1998 was awarded three Michelin stars.   Rochat retired in 2012. Violier and his wife then took over running the restaurant. The two men were close; Violier regarded Rochat as his mentor and a second father. He was doubly devastated when his father died in April last year, and Rochat, 61, died three months later after falling ill while out cycling.  \u201cIt\u2019s like a curse,\u201d Veyrat said of the Crissier. \u201cCan it survive this new drama? I think so. There are some super chefs in Beno\u00eet Violier\u2019s establishment. He knew how to create a strong human environment, which will continue to live \u2026 I remember having youngsters who\u2019d worked for him come to me. They were all so happy to be there, so enthusiastic to work for a great chef.\u201d  In an interview in December 2014 with the Swiss television channel RTS, a smiling Violier said the stress of haute cuisine was \u201cnecessary\u201d to maintain standards.  \u201cIt\u2019s my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI go to sleep with cooking, I wake up to cooking.\u201d ", "title": "'World's best chef' Beno\u00eet Violier mourned by his peers", "sentences": ["What other profession would accept being constantly evaluated?\u201d  Pierre Gagnaire, another three-star Michelin chef, who was named by his peers as the \u201cbiggest star chef in the world\u201d and who has restaurants in Paris, London, Tokyo, Dubai, Moscow and Berlin as well as Sketch in London, added: \u201cTerribly sad news for an extremely talented chef.\u201d Paul Bocuse, named \u201cchef of the century\u201d by the food guide Gault et Millau and the Culinary Institute of America, said of Violier: \u201cA grand chef, a grand man, a gigantic talent.\u201d   Fr\u00e9dy Girardet, a friend of Violier and his wife Brigitte, and another three-star titan of Swiss haute cuisine who had previously run the restaurant in Crissier, said he was \u201ccompletely stunned\u201d."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-01T16:11:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/01/jordan-spieth-singapore-rory-mcilroy", "tags": ["Jordan Spieth", "Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "Even a stunning rise to No1 in the world has not made Jordan Spieth immune to learning curves.

In Bloemfontein the first of five ODIs between England and South Africa takes place on Wednesday. These will be followed by two T20 matches, which should have a special urgency since England will be setting off for India in little more than a month for the World T20. And Jason Roy, the exciting Surrey opening batsman, has a most inconvenient back spasm. In fact the spasm may be more inconvenient to Roy than the England selectors. It afflicted him on Monday and he will be given a rigorous fitness test before the match on Wednesday. If there are any doubts he will be omitted. The simple fact is England have too many batsmen to choose from at the moment. Roy\u2019s absence could ease the pressure. Coaches and captains always say this is a nice problem to have. But it\u2019s not that nice and it will have caused Trevor Bayliss and Eoin Morgan a bit of heartache, however clear-headed they may be. In November England delivered some impressive ODI cricket in Dubai, winning three consecutive matches after a lacklustre start in their first game against Pakistan. They were equally impressive in the ensuing T20 matches. In the 50-over games they kept the same XI throughout in the United Arab Emirates but now there are some significant additions to their squad. Ben Stokes, destined for the cover of the 2016 Wisden, is back; so too is Stuart Broad, albeit as a consequence of injuries to Steven Finn and Liam Plunkett, and Jonny Bairstow has been batting like a prince (more Ranji than Ashwell, perhaps). Surely Stokes has to play; Broad may have to wait his turn but it would be mildly absurd if a player of his seniority was here merely to ferry the drinks for a fortnight. Likewise it seems that Bairstow, despite his rich vein of form, will have to begin the series as a bystander. If Roy is fit it is not even that straightforward to accommodate Stokes. Maybe James Taylor, a centurion in the warm-up match against South Africa A, might be left out. Hence the expectation Roy\u2019s fitness test will be pretty demanding. If he is unable to play in Bloemfontein England have three alternatives at the top of the order: Moeen Ali, Joe Root and Taylor. Of these Moeen would be the easiest choice, Root the most interesting, Taylor the most unlikely. Root has been playing so well there is a reluctance, which verges almost on superstition \u2013 and cricketers tend to be very superstitious people \u2013 to shift him. This certainly applies in Test cricket, where there is a good case for Root to bat at three, as well as in ODI cricket, where he might prosper as an opener, while enabling more form batsmen to be included down the order. If Root needs any persuasion perhaps he could be flattered by being invited to take up the \u201cTendulkar option\u201d. The task ahead for Morgan\u2019s team is severe. South Africa may have been wobbling in the Test arena in 2015 but they have won their past two ODI series, away to India and at home against New Zealand. Despite his three consecutive Test ducks AB de Villiers, who has hit three centuries in his past five ODI outings, remains the greatest threat. But runs can come from many quarters. However, De Villiers will be handicapped by the continued absence of Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander as well as the need to rest Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel along the way.   Related: India finally finish off AB de Villiers and South Africa to complete 3-0 series win    The challenge provided by the South Africans, especially when they have the bat in their hands, will exceed that provided by Pakistan before Christmas. As ever Morgan offers pragmatism rather than promises. \u201cAny away tour is about learning on your feet as quickly as you can and adapting to conditions,\u201d he said on the eve of the match. \u201cOne advantage we have had on this tour is that there are more guys in the Test team. They have been here a while and can share information. Another is that we have pushed our boundaries over the last eight months we have been together and that is becoming the norm. We are not quite there yet in terms of catching up with the World Cup teams that went out there and scored 300 on a regular basis. But we are making strides towards that.\u201d This time around the problem may not be reaching 300 but restricting opponents under that score, especially in the thin air of the Highveld. The last time England were here for an ODI, exactly 11 years ago, the match was tied (270 runs each) thanks to an astonishing final over by Kabir Ali, who until then had \u201cbowled like a camel and fielded like a drain\u201d, according to Bob Willis.

They had reached peak Garry. During a slapstick 24 hours, their much-derided chief executive, Garry Cook, returned home from Italy emptyhanded having had a \u00a3108m bid for Kak\u00e1 turned down, accusing Milan of \u201cbottling it\u201d for good measure.   Related: Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City move highlights how far United have fallen behind | Jamie Jackson    On landing in Manchester, he was told that the misfiring striker Robinho, signed for a then British record \u00a332.5m as a statement of intent, had quit their training camp to attend to family issues in Brazil. Seven years later and no one is laughing. City have just snared the most sought after coach in world football as part of a well-thought-out strategy that first involved bringing the executives that formed such a close working relationship with him at Barcelona. No longer noisy neighbours, their actions have spoken loudest of all. Four months before Cook\u2019s slapstick sojourn in Milan, Sheikh Mansour\u2019s Abu Dhabi United Group had ushered in a new era for English football by ending the chaotic, controversial reign of Thaksin Shinawatra in a deal worth around \u00a3200m. In the time since, hundreds of millions of pounds more have flowed from Abu Dhabi to east Manchester. On the pitch, progress has been sudden and dramatic in relation to City\u2019s history but, at least if the Champions League is also taken into account, perhaps merely above par rather than spectacular. It is off the pitch that the divergent paths taken by City and their rivals are fascinating. While Roman Abramovich burned through a succession of managers, ending up back where he started with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in a failed attempt to rekindle his first love and United have failed the post-Ferguson exam question, City\u2019s succession planning looks remarkably well engineered in comparison. It did not always feel that way at the time, not least in the slightly shabby way that the departures were handled, but in hindsight the progression from Mark Hughes to Roberto Mancini to Manuel Pellegrini to Guardiola looks as seamless as an upwardly mobile car fanatic trading in every couple of years for a new model. It was telling that City\u2019s statement confirming the much trailed arrival of Guardiola contained a reference to negotiations having started in 2012. Since then, the ongoing regeneration of the area around the Etihad in east Manchester has won the club\u2019s owners brownie points from local politicians. An academy has been built from the ground up that has so comprehensively outmanoeuvred its rivals that it has sparked jealousy and anger in the red half of Manchester, once so pre-eminent in youth development. Uefa\u2019s financial fair play restrictions have been seen off, with revenue growth (partly fuelled by the new TV deal) and the relaxation of the rules enough to ensure comfort on that score. And a network of overseas clubs that once looked like a curate\u2019s egg is starting to coalesce into shape with the highly rated Patrick Vieira bound for New York and Chinese investment making the idea of a global network of City branded clubs make more sense. If there is still a nagging unease about the extent to which an arm of a Gulf state (now backed by a Chinese investment fund) has bought into one of the biggest names in English football for its own ends, the club\u2019s owners are doing all they can to blunt it by doing the right things on the ground. It is not a factor that is likely to trouble Guardiola, with his long-time links to Qatar, for long. And City fans would be right to point out that similar queasiness could also be derived from a Russian oligarch who made his money in questionable circumstances or American buyers pulling off a leveraged buyout that has seen hundreds of millions flow out of the club. Manchester United retain the edge in commercial terms, having minted a global sponsorship model under the stewardship of Ed Woodward that traded heavily on their romantic history but in doing so became the envy of every other club in world football. But City are closing fast, with the recently published Deloitte Money League confirming they remain second only to United in the English game in terms of revenues. The respected financial blogger Swiss Ramble has pointed out that those once contentious sweetheart deals with Etihad are now arguably undervalued. Guardiola\u2019s very presence will bring a certain air of luxury and class to City\u2019s operations, adding a sheen that will play well with global sponsors. If Real Madrid and Barcelona have stolen a march on Premier League clubs in some parts of the world \u2013 visit the world\u2019s busiest airport hub in Dubai and count the number of families clad in Messi or Ronaldo shirts for proof \u2013 then City are thinking imaginatively about how to make inroads. Of course, their rivals are all thinking about how they too can best take advantage of the continued growth of the Premier League in exploding new markets from the US to China and India. But if the first phase of the Premier League\u2019s overseas expansion was characterised by a \u201cme too\u201d dash for commercial deals, what is fascinating is the extent to which the biggest clubs are now set on markedly different paths. Their scattered overseas owners might have had different reasons for buying into the Premier League growth story, and be motivated to a greater or lesser extent by prestige or profit, but there are now clear differences in strategy. In capturing a young sought-after manager from overseas, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool are perhaps closest in profile to City \u2013 but the move for the German was an opportunistic rather than strategic one. Meanwhile, the distribution model that keeps the Premier League competitive and the big bucks flowing in has also increased the jeopardy factor. As Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have found in different ways, it doesn\u2019t take much to send a season out of kilter in a ferociously competitive league. Pitching themselves somewhere between Abramovich\u2019s belief that he can perpetually rip things up and start again while continuing to win things (which appears to have cost him Guardiola) and the safety-first approach of Ivan Gazidis and Ars\u00e9ne Wenger to making no sudden movements at Arsenal (likewise), City have secured their new quarry. In doing so they have created the conditions in which they have the chance to create a dynasty on and off the pitch, potentially leapfrogging the local rivals who have long cast a shadow in the process. The question is: having invested so much forethought in luring their man to the Etihad, can they and Guardiola now take it?", "title": "From Garry Cook to Pep Guardiola: Manchester City have come a long way", "sentences": ["If Real Madrid and Barcelona have stolen a march on Premier League clubs in some parts of the world \u2013 visit the world\u2019s busiest airport hub in Dubai and count the number of families clad in Messi or Ronaldo shirts for proof \u2013 then City are thinking imaginatively about how to make inroads."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-02T17:42:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/02/yahoo-earnings-cutting-workforce-closing-offices-tech", "tags": ["Yahoo", "Marissa Mayer", "Quarterly results", "Business", "Technology", "Internet"], "article": "Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer has announced plans to cut the company\u2019s workforce by 15% and close five foreign offices by the end of 2016. The struggling tech company reported a $4.4bn loss for the last three months of 2015 as it wrote down the value of assets including Tumblr, the blogging site it bought for $1bn in 2013. Mayer, a former high-flying Google executive, has come under pressure from activist shareholders unhappy with her tenure. She announced an \u201caggressive strategic plan\u201d that is expected to lead to the sale of parts of its business. Mayer blasted \u201cfalsehoods\u201d she said had been circulating in the media, including reports that the company had spent $7m on its holiday party and $4m on a food program. Yahoo is a \u201cfar stronger, more modern company than the one I joined three and a half years ago,\u201d she told analysts. Yahoo\u2019s fourth quarter earnings for 2015 were better than expected, coming in at $1.27bn. Overall, the revenue for 2015 was $4.9bn, up from $4.6bn the year before. But the company\u2019s traffic acquisition costs (TAC), the amount Yahoo spends to attract users to its websites, rose to $271m in the fourth quarter, up from $74m a year earlier. Activist investor Starboard contacted the Yahoo board as the results were released demanding a change in management. Board member Charles Schwab announced he would step down as the results were announced. Yahoo said its strategic plan would simplify the company and narrow its focus. While revenue has gone up, Yahoo shares have fallen 33% over the past year. Over the past three months they have fallen by 17%. Its shares fell in after-hours trading. As part of its plan, Yahoo:  is expected to exit offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan by end of the first quarter in 2016.   expects its workforce to be down to 9,000 and have fewer than 1,000 contractors by end of 2016.  \u201cToday, we\u2019re announcing a strategic plan that we strongly believe will enable us to accelerate Yahoo\u2019s transformation,\u201d said Mayer. \u201cThis is a strong plan calling for bold shifts in products and in resources.\u201d The company also reinforced its commitment to spinning off its $31bn stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce business. \u201cSeparating our Alibaba stake from our operating business continues to be a primary focus, and our most direct path to value maximization,\u201d said Maynard Webb, Yahoo\u2019s chairman. \u201cIn addition to continuing work on the reverse spin, which we\u2019ve discussed previously, we will engage on qualified strategic proposals.\u201d  The job cuts announced on Tuesday are not the first round of layoffs under Mayer. About a third of Yahoo\u2019s workforce has left either voluntarily or involuntarily over the last year. Even as Yahoo contemplates further cuts, one former employee has filed a lawsuit in federal district court in San Jose, California, alleging that Yahoo\u2019s employee ranking system allowed senior managers to fire hundreds of employees without just cause. The California department of fair employment and housing is investigating Yahoo\u2019s use of the rating system. \u2018Dead elephant in the room\u2019 The lawsuit is not the only issue that Yahoo has had to address in the past couple of weeks. A small group of activists began the morning with a protest outside Yahoo\u2019s San Francisco offices, calling attention to what they call \u201cthe dead elephant in the room\u201d: Yahoo Japan\u2019s sale of ivory products on its online auction site. More than a million people have signed a petition circulated by online advocacy group Avaaz calling on Yahoo Japan to follow the lead of other online retailers like Google and Amazon in banning the sale of ivory. The protesters erected a seven-foot-tall inflatable elephant outside the company\u2019s doors and distributed copies of the San Francisco Chronicle, which contains a full-page advertisement urging Mayer to \u201cstop the bloody ivory trade\u201d. Yahoo Japan is a joint venture between Yahoo and the Japanese telecoms firm SoftBank. On 27 January, Yahoo released a statement emphasizing that, while Yahoo Inc does not allow the sale of ivory, the company does not control policy for Yahoo Japan. In the statement, Yahoo Inc said it was asking Yahoo Japan \u201cto reexamine and to clarify their company\u2019s policies\u201d toward sales of products from endangered species.", "title": "Yahoo cutting workforce by 15% after announcing $4.4bn loss", "sentences": ["As part of its plan, Yahoo:  is expected to exit offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan by end of the first quarter in 2016.   expects its workforce to be down to 9,000 and have fewer than 1,000 contractors by end of 2016."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-02T22:23:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/feb/03/tiger-woods-rory-mcilroy-golf-dubai-desert-classic", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Rory McIlroy", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "Two years ago this week Tiger Woods remained in his commercial prime. He could claim a substantial appearance fee to appear in the Dubai Desert Classic, had won five times in 2013 and was a crucial part of golf\u2019s narrative. On the Friday afternoon of that tournament, albeit linked to commitments which are tied into appearance deals, Woods took to the range alongside his old friend Mark O\u2019Meara for a golfing clinic. The pair provided a brilliantly enjoyable masterclass for 100 or so onlookers, complete with microphones and Woods\u2019 self-deprecation regarding the round of 73 he had just completed. It was educational and fun. Only a comment from the 14-times major winner\u2019s manager to an onlooking journalist spoiled the scene. \u201cThis is the Tiger you guys should be writing about,\u201d was the claim. This was a depressing snapshot of the attitude which has played a part in Woods\u2019s negative image. The man himself was relaxed and clearly not remotely concerned as to who was writing about what. There is, of course, no Tiger in Dubai this time. His future has never looked more bleak as he continues an attempted recovery from ongoing back issues. The serious spectre of him not competing at all in 2016 looms large given the continuing silence regarding the 40-year-old\u2019s professional aspirations.   Related: Jordan Spieth plans to reduce travel after gruelling spell ends in Singapore    An interesting insight into Woods arrived this week from Rory McIlroy. During an interview with Dubai Eye radio, when fulfilling commitments for Bose, the Northern Irishman spoke of personal appreciation for Woods, on and off the course. \u201cHe gives off this persona of being quite intimidating,\u201d McIlroy explained. \u201cI\u2019d love to achieve what he\u2019s achieved, but then again the life he\u2019s had to lead over the past 10 or 15 years is very, very difficult. He can\u2019t go anywhere. It would be tough to live that life so I can see why he is so guarded. \u201cBut once you gain his trust he\u2019s great. He\u2019s great fun both on and off the golf course. I only live 15 minutes away from him in Florida and we play some casual rounds together. He\u2019s just a normal guy. \u201cI think he craves that normality in his life because his life has been so abnormal for so many years. I\u2019m lucky I have a grounded life and I can do normal, everyday things and I can feel he craves that. \u201cHe\u2019s now with his kids trying to be the best father he can be. He\u2019s putting all his effort into that. I respect him for that and that\u2019s why hopefully one day he can come back and have another go at trying to win majors and give every golf fan what they want to see.\u201d McIlroy would be entitled to contrasting emotions regarding Woods\u2019s predicament. In one respect, it is clearly easier for this golfing generation to pursue major glory when not facing Woods in his pomp. In another, and McIlroy readily admits as much, there would be a genuine thrill attached to the heat of battle with one of this sport\u2019s legends. Phil Mickelson genuinely seemed to benefit as a golfer from having Woods as the highest bar to reach for. \u201cSelfishly, it\u2019s not a bad thing at the minute that Tiger isn\u2019t competing with us,\u201d McIlroy added. \u201cBut I\u2019d love to see him, as a golf fan myself, just have one more crack at it.

If he can do that and then piece his golf game back together I\u2019d love to see him get another year or two at it because it would be great to see him go out on some sort of a high. \u201cThis generation coming through, we grew up watching Tiger Woods and he was really the benchmark for us. So to see what he\u2019s done in the game and to see how successful he was, he really changed the sport. He made it younger, he made it cooler and he made it more athletic. We all wanted to emulate what he did. \u201cI am a huge Tiger geek. I could tell you all his achievements, when he won there, where he won them, where I was when he won them. I was a huge fan of Tiger, just like a lot of my generation were. It was definitely him that set the benchmark for us that we\u2019re trying to achieve now.\u201d The Desert Classic isn\u2019t the only reason to pause for Tiger reflection. This week\u2019s PGA Tour stop is the Waste Management Phoenix Open, the site of Woods\u2019s inauspicious 82 last year but, more memorably, where he called on spectator support to move a boulder before being free to play an otherwise impossible shot in 1999.

In Dubai on Wednesday, the Northern Irishman was at his most effusive when discussing the brilliance of Andy Murray, whom McIlroy described as \u201cone of the best British sportspeople ever\u201d. Murray is the world No2 in tennis, the same position McIlroy holds in golf. Murray appeared in his ninth grand slam final on Sunday, losing to Novak Djokovic and thereby unable to add to his record of two grand slam wins. McIlroy has an obvious link to tennis through his previous relationship with Caroline Wozniacki and it is an environment to which he previously, and still, pays close attention. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find a more driven, more dedicated professional athlete in the world than Andy Murray,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cHe does absolutely everything in his power to get the most out of his game. He\u2019s a Wimbledon champion, US Open champion, Olympic champion. He\u2019s one\u00a0of the best British sportspeople ever in my opinion.   Related: Sands of time running out for Tiger Woods as golf looks to Dubai Desert Classic | Ewan Murray    \u201cBut he\u2019s been unlucky. He\u2019s come up in an era with Roger Federer to start, Rafa Nadal and now Novak. And Novak looks like he could potentially be better than all of them. He could win more grand slams than Roger and could ultimately be the best ever. \u201cSo just to compete with that and come up against that the whole time, it must be tough in a way but at the same time, he\u2019s the second best in the world at what he does and he\u2019s already proven that he can win at the highest level. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll continue to.\u201d McIlroy acknowledged regular defeat to Djokovic on the biggest stages must prove tough mentally for the Scot. In golfing parlance, it would represent exaggeration to portray Jordan Spieth as Djokovic but McIlroy is still on a mission to claim back the status of his game\u2019s top-ranked player. A feeling of familiarity may well boost that quest; McIlroy begins the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday morning seeking to become the second player after Ernie Els to win the event three times. On his last Dubai start, at the DP World Tour Championship in November, McIlroy also\u00a0triumphed. \u201cThis place just seems to bring out some of my best golf,\u201d said the defending champion. \u201cI\u2019ve got great memories from the Emirates Club here: winning my first tournament, making my first cut as a pro. So it\u2019s always great to be back. \u201cThis is the 10th year since I started coming here and playing in the tournament, twice as an amateur. So I have a lot of great memories and get a lot of support here.\u201d With two months still to go, the prospect of McIlroy and Spieth jousting for a Green Jacket at Augusta National is already exciting the golfing masses. McIlroy is happy to be part of that discussion but will not be influenced by this week\u2019s comments of Lee Trevino, who asserted the 26-year-old will not only win one career grand slam of majors but multiple. \u201cIt\u2019s just someone giving their opinion,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThe difference between someone saying that and me actually going out and doing it are two entirely different things. Yes, I\u2019d like to think by the end of my career, I\u2019ll hopefully have won each major more than once. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to do it. I hope I do, of course I hope so, but I don\u2019t think it [that suggestion] takes any pressure off going into Augusta. \u201cI\u2019ve got hopefully 20-plus years of giving it a go and hopefully by that time, I\u2019m not going for my first Green Jacket. Hopefully I\u2019m going for my third or fourth.\u201d Spieth and Rickie Fowler both spoke in Abu Dhabi a fortnight ago about their desire to wrestle the Ryder Cup from Europe\u2019s grasp. The growing sense is of a youthful, motivated USA team \u2013 which does a slight disservice to Europe\u2019s tried and tested recipe for victory. \u201cThey are a young, hungry team for a reason,\u201d McIlroy observed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys on that team that haven\u2019t tasted success at the Ryder Cup. This is going to be hopefully my fourth Ryder Cup, and I\u2019m going for my fourth win in a row. I\u2019m going to be trying to be part of a team that\u2019s won for the last four times. They [the US] are motivated, they are hungry and I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to lose again. \u201cIf you look at the last few Ryder Cups, even though we have won them, they have been tight; maybe not Gleneagles, but you look at the previous two, Medinah and Celtic Manor, they were really, really tight.

When a house was recently burgled in the fishing settlement on Pakistan\u2019s desert coast, the only items stolen were cans of fresh water \u2013 a staple that has soared in value since reservoirs dried up. It lies in Balochistan, a province in the grip of a long-running separatist insurgency and Pakistan\u2019s most neglected. Yet local officials dream of a future where Gwadar becomes a second Shenzhen, the Chinese trade hub bordering Hong Kong. Visitors are told that with Chinese investment the small settlement will become a major node of world commerce boasting car factories, Pakistan\u2019s biggest airport and a string of five-star resort hotels along Gwadar\u2019s sparkling seafront. But residents are aghast, and not just because the fishing community, long settled on the neck of the peninsula, will be moved to new harbours up to 40km away. \u201cThis is all being done for China, not the people,\u201d said Elahi Bakhsh, a fisherman bewildered by the plans to turn Gwadar into China\u2019s deepwater access point to the Arabian Sea. Like others he complains of chronic underdevelopment in a district judged food insecure by the UN in 2009 and a town with only rudimentary health and education services. Bakhsh had not had enough water to wash his clothes in weeks. He and five of his colleagues turned down an offer of tea \u2013 the mandatory accompaniment to any meeting in Pakistan \u2013 in favour of bottles of mineral water.   Related: Balochistan: Pakistan's information black hole    \u201cThe whole area has been captured by the government with local people pushed aside,\u201d he said. If all goes to plan, the existing 80,000 population will be joined by another 2 million people over the next 20 years, including 20,000 Chinese residents, according to an official at the Gwadar Development Authority. It was Dubai, not Shenzhen, that was being touted as the model for Gwadar\u2019s future 10 years ago. But that initiative only succeeded in ruining countless property speculators. Officials say things are different this time because of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), a project announced last year with pledges from Beijing of $46bn (\u00a332bn) in investment loans. It will help pay for the expansion of Gwadar\u2019s currently unused deepwater port and the construction of a road network the exact route of which is subject to hot inter-provincial controversy that will connect the port to the Chinese border 1,800km to the north amid Himalayan peaks. Pakistan hopes the corridor will turn the country into a critical land route for the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. In theory exporters in Xinjiang will have a much shorter journey to the Arabian Sea and international markets than via China\u2019s eastern ports. In practice sceptics wonder whether trucking goods over one of the world\u2019s highest mountain ranges will ever be cheaper than existing sea routes. They suspect China is more interested in Gwadar as a potential naval base near the oil supplies of the Gulf. Ensuring security on long stretches of road in a province wracked by a persistent, low-level insurgency is the biggest challenge to CPEC. Fear of being outnumbered by outsiders from the rest of Pakistan is fuelling a violent rebellion in Balochistan.   CPEC   The Pakistan-China economic corridor is a particular target because separatists see it as a demographic threat to the native Baloch, who are thought to make up just over half of the 8 million people living in the province. \u201cThe corridor passes through what is currently the heart of the insurgency,\u201d says Kaiser Bengali, an economic adviser to Balochistan\u2019s chief minister. He said the notion that the two special brigades formed by the army will be enough to protect road traffic was \u201claughable\u201d.  \u201cIf every convoy of trucks has to be accompanied by half a dozen tanks, armoured carriers and helicopters the cost is going to be exorbitant,\u201d he said. All five rebellions that have hit the province since 1947 were underpinned by Baloch claims that Islamabad exploits the province\u2019s extensive gas and mineral riches for the benefit of the country\u2019s ruling establishment in Punjab. Pakistan says arch-enemy India also stirs up trouble. \u201cForeign adversaries have been more than eager to exploit any opportunity to destabilise Pakistan by harbouring, training and funding dissidents and militants\u201d, said army chief General Raheel Sharif, who joined the prime minister in Balochistan on Wednesday for the inauguration of a section of CPEC highway. The current rebellion was triggered by the rape of a female doctor by a military officer in 2005. The year before a car bomb killed three Chinese engineers in Gwadar.     Pakistan naval guards stand near the wreckage of the 2004 car bomb that killed three Chinese engineers in Gwadar. Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty Images    Chinese visitors say they remain worried about security despite the elaborate efforts to keep them safe. Investors and officials from Beijing only move about Gwadar accompanied by military vehicles and only after all the roads have been cleared of traffic. The road is picketed with policemen at 50-metre intervals. \u201cFor the locals it\u2019s like being a prisoner in your own town,\u201d said Shamshad Ahmed a retired army officer who has been coming to the town for years as part of his work at the Pearl Continental, Gwadar\u2019s only five-star hotel that recently reopened after being mothballed for years. \u201cOf course they are not happy about their freedom being taken away,\u201d he said. The sense of containment will only increase with plans to build a security fence that will completely surround the town as the port is developed. \u201cEveryone coming in will have to show a residency pass so we can keep a record of who lives in Gwadar,\u201d police inspector Chakar Khan explained. Officials in Gwadar say the main town is safe, even if trouble remains in outlying areas. On 9 January two Pakistan coast guard officials were killed and three injured by a roadside bomb in the district. Strenuous efforts have been made to secure the thinly populated but vast province, roughly the size of Germany. The military campaign to weaken a scrappy and deeply divided insurgency has had some success and in 2015 separatist violence fell 36% to 194 attacks, according to a tally of press reports by the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies. But critics say the army has disastrously mishandled the situation with improved security won at the cost of deepening alienation among the Baloch. Former moderates have been driven into the hands of increasingly intransigent separatists, detractors say. Road users complain of routine humiliations at checkpoints where busloads of passengers can be detained for hours. It is the issue of \u201cmissing persons\u201d that has caused most anger. Intelligence agents, often accompanied by the paramilitary Frontier Corps, are accused of snatching suspected militants who \u201cdisappear\u201d into secret detention sites. Many turn up dead in deserted areas, their dumped bodies often showing signs of torture.     An aerial view of Gwadar port in 2014. Photograph: Alamy    Last year the provincial government revealed the bodies of 800 people linked to the insurgency were recovered between 2011 and 2014. It also estimated 950 people are still missing, although some claims go as high as 14,000 according to a 2013 report by a UN fact-finding team.  Where previous rebellions were led by tribal chieftains in northern Balochistan, who were amenable to cutting deals with the state, the current uprising is dominated by the non-tribal middle-class in Makran, the belt stretching some 200km inland from Gwadar. And unlike in the past, rebels have targeted non-Baloch civilians. Human rights groups say more than 1,000 such \u201csettlers\u201d have been killed since 2006, including a teacher at a school where pupils were forced to sing the Pakistani national anthem. Civilians from Makran complain of being caught between the insurgents and the Frontier Corps, who are fighting where the infrastructure for the China-Pakistan corridor is to be built.

A brother of one candidate was kidnapped while another had his house burned down. Those who remain engaged in electoral politics have hardened their positions. Akthar Mengal, leader of the Balochistan National party (BNP) and a former chief minister of the province, said Pakistan\u2019s leaders \u201clook at us worse than slaves\u201d. \u201cIn their mind we are not a province of this country, we are a colony,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the name of development they want to turn us into a minority in our own land.\u201d Efforts by the provincial government to negotiate a political solution with separatist leaders, some of whom are living in self-exile in Europe, are under way. But civilian politicians say they are powerless to restrain the military\u2019s counter-insurgency operations.   Gwadar development plan   Moderate Baloch leaders meanwhile say any deal with the insurgents must include constitutional protections for indigenous people, particularly in Gwadar where many residents feel more attachment to Oman, which owned the peninsula until 1958. Aziz Baloch, a BNP party official in Gwadar, said a system of work and residency permits should be established so outsiders would be barred from voting in elections. Some hope the jobs and economic activity created by CPEC will weaken support for the separatists. Many locals are sceptical however, pointing out that people from Balochistan, with its tiny share of the national population, are entitled to only 6% of government jobs and are rarely qualified for the best ones. A newspaper advert for jobs last March in Gwadar\u2019s fisheries department offered senior, technical positions to Pakistanis from Punjab and only menial roles such as cleaners and guards to locals. \u201cThe suspicion is that all the Baloch will get from CPEC is the right to repair punctures on Chinese tires,\u201d said Bengali, the economic adviser. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, struck a conciliatory tone in December at a ceremony to inaugurate a section of CPEC. He said Balochistan must have \u201cthe first right over all resources which have been explored in the province\u201d. But he also announced an upgrade for an existing highway running along the sparsely populated desert coast. It would allow Chinese trucks to head east towards Karachi before going northwards on secure roads in other provinces, bypassing much of troublesome Balochistan entirely.", "title": "A new Shenzhen?

Relatively few people outside the tech world are aware of the so-called \u201cerror 53\u201d problem, but if it happens to you you\u2019ll know about it. And according to one specialist journalist, it \u201cwill kill your iPhone\u201d.   Related: Apple says iPhone 'Error 53' is to protect customers' security    The issue appears to affect handsets where the home button, which has touch ID fingerprint recognition built-in, has been repaired by a \u201cnon-official\u201d company or individual. It has also reportedly affected customers whose phone has been damaged but who have been able to carry on using it without the need for a repair. But the problem only comes to light when the latest version of Apple\u2019s iPhone software, iOS 9, is installed. Indeed, the phone may have been working perfectly for weeks or months since a repair or being damaged. After installation a growing number of people have watched in horror as their phone, which may well have cost them \u00a3500-plus, is rendered useless. Any photos or other data held on the handset is lost \u2013 and irretrievable. Tech experts claim Apple knows all about the problem but has done nothing to warn users that their phone will be \u201cbricked\u201d (ie, rendered as technologically useful as a brick) if they install the iOS upgrade.     No choice: journalist Antonio Olmos dropped his iPhone while covering the refugee crisis and had to use a local repair shop    Freelance photographer and self-confessed Apple addict Antonio Olmos says this happened to his phone a few weeks ago after he upgraded his software. Olmos had previously had his handset repaired while on an assignment for the Guardian in Macedonia. \u201cI was in the Balkans covering the refugee crisis in September when I dropped my phone. Because I desperately needed it for work I got it fixed at a local shop, as there are no Apple stores in Macedonia. They repaired the screen and home button, and it worked perfectly.\u201d He says he thought no more about it, until he was sent the standard notification by Apple inviting him to install the latest software. He accepted the upgrade, but within seconds the phone was displaying \u201cerror 53\u201d and was, in effect, dead. When Olmos, who says he has spent thousands of pounds on Apple products over the years, took it to an Apple store in London, staff told him there was nothing they could do, and that his phone was now junk. He had to pay \u00a3270 for a replacement and is furious.    How can a company deliberately make its own product useless with an upgrade, and not warn customers about it?  Antonio Olmos     \u201cThe whole thing is extraordinary. How can a company deliberately make their own products useless with an upgrade and not warn their own customers about it? Outside of the big industrialised nations, Apple stores are few and far between, and damaged phones can only be brought back to life by small third-party repairers. \u201cI am not even sure these third-party outfits even know this is a potential problem,\u201d he says. Olmos is far from the only one affected. If you Google \u201ciPhone 6\u201d and \u201cerror 53\u201d you will find no shortage of people reporting that they have been left with a phone that now only functions as a very expensive paperweight. Posting a message on an Apple Support Communities forum on 31 December, \u201cArjunthebuster\u201d is typical. He/she says they bought their iPhone 6 in January 2015 in Dubai, and dropped it the following month causing a small amount of damage.   Related: Be a smart phone user \u2013 follow our five steps to cheaper mobile bills    They carried on using the phone, but when they tried to install iOS 9 in November \u201cerror 53\u201d popped up. \u201cThe error hasn\u2019t occurred because I broke my phone (it was working fine for 10 months). I lost all my data because of this error. I don\u2019t want Apple to fix my screen or anything! I just want them to fix the \u2018error 53\u2019 so I can use my phone, but they won\u2019t!\u201d Could Apple\u2019s move, which appears to be designed to squeeze out independent repairers, contravene competition rules? Car manufacturers, for example, are not allowed to insist that buyers only get their car serviced by them. Apple charges \u00a3236 for a repair to the home button on an iPhone 6 in the UK, while an independent repairer would demand a fraction of that. California-based tech expert Kyle Wiens, who runs the iFixit website, says this is a major issue. \u201cThe \u2018error 53\u2019 page on our website has had more than 183,000 hits, suggesting this is a big problem for Apple users,\u201d he told Guardian Money. \u201cThe problem occurs if the repairer changes the home button or the cable. Following the software upgrade the phone in effect checks to make sure it is still using the original components, and if it isn\u2019t, it simply locks out the phone. There is no warning, and there\u2019s no way that I know of to bring it back to life.\u201d He says it is unclear whether this is a deliberate move to force anyone who drops their phone to use Apple for a repair. \u201cAll along, Apple\u2019s view is that it does not want third parties carrying out repairs to its products, and this looks like an obvious extension of that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat it should do is allow its customers to recalibrate their phone after a repair. Only when there is a huge outcry about this problem will it do something.\u201d The Daily Dot website features an article by tech writer Mike Wehner headlined \u201cError 53 will kill your iPhone and no one knows what it is\u201d. He relates how his own iPhone 6 Plus was left \u201ceffectively dead to the world\u201d.    Only when there is a huge outcry about this problem will Apple do something  Kyle Wiens     Meanwhile, an article by tech writer Reuben Esparza, published in November by iCracked, a phone repair service, states: \u201cWhen pressed for more information about the error, few, if any Apple employees could offer an explanation. There was no part they would replace, no software fix, and no way to access the phone\u2019s memory. The fix was a new iPhone.\u201d It continues: \u201cThough still largely a mystery to most, we now know that error 53 is the result of a hardware failure somewhere within the home button assembly.\u201d A spokeswoman for Apple told Money (get ready for a jargon overload): \u201cWe protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the touch ID sensor. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted, thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure.\u201d She adds: \u201cWhen an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorised repair provider, faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could cause the check to fail if the pairing cannot be validated. With a subsequent update or restore, additional security checks result in an \u2018error 53\u2019 being displayed \u2026 If a customer encounters an unrecoverable error 53, we recommend contacting Apple support.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Error 53\u2019 fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill your iPhone 6", "sentences": ["He/she says they bought their iPhone 6 in January 2015 in Dubai, and dropped it the following month causing a small amount of damage."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-05T06:59:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/05/rory-mcilroy-avoids-cut-dubai-golf", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Sport", "European Tour", "Golf", "Danny Willett"], "article": "For a brief Friday afternoon spell, things were not going to plan at all in this corner of the Middle East. Either for Rory McIlroy or the organisers of the Dubai Desert Classic, that is. When the world No2 took three putts at the 11th, he slipped back to level par and therefore to the wrong side of the cut line. For a player who was such short odds to win the tournament before a shot was struck, to depart the scene with 36 holes to play would have represented a serious shock and a blow to the allure of this event. A McIlroy recovery was to follow, courtesy of four birdies over the closing stretch. At six strokes behind the halfway leader, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, retaining the Desert Classic remains a strong possibility. For that to happen, McIlroy admits he needs both a \u201cfast start\u201d and improvement on a putting performance he described as \u201ctentative\u201d.   Related: Social cleansing at Wentworth golf club is merely a sign of the times | Richard Williams    Was a second missed cut as a professional in this event in McIlroy\u2019s thoughts? \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI was definitely thinking about it, especially over a putt on 12. \u201cI had a six-footer for par on 12. If I missed that, one over for the tournament, it would have been a long way back from there. So to make that putt and play the next six holes in four under par was a nice way to finish. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my best stuff with me, struggled at the start of the round and around the middle of the round. I needed something just to, first and foremost, be here for the weekend. Then birdieing the last three holes, that definitely gives me a little bit of momentum going into the weekend. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of players between myself and the lead but at the same time, I\u2019ve come back from bigger deficits than this and this is one of my favourite places. If I can get off to a faster start tomorrow, you never know. And I\u2019ll get better conditions, as well. I\u2019ll be out a little earlier. The greens and the course in general got very firm and very fast out there, so hopefully I can get out in the morning and post a good score.\u201d Ernie Els backed up a Thursday 68 with a 67 to lie within one of the lead. \u201cRory is obviously the guy to beat this week,\u201d said Els. \u201cHe is such an explosive player. I would love to be in the mix with him.\u201d Danny Willett is on the same aggregate score as Els with Thorbjorn Olesen, Andy Sullivan, Joost Luiten, Henrik Stenson, Bryson Dechambeau and An Byeong-hun among 36 players at four under or better. Sullivan is perhaps the Leicester City of golf; he simply refuses to go away. He is competing in style, too; as emphasised by back-to-back halves of 33 on day two. \u201cIt will be fun to have a run at them on the weekend,\u201d said a confident Sullivan. \u201cThis is a nice little position to be in, just tucked in there behind the leaders at the moment.\u201d Willett, who should be looking to join Sullivan in a Ryder Cup battle later this year, carded a Friday 65 which did not include a single bogey. The Englishman\u2019s superb 2015 has afforded him scope for rest time during the coming season which he aims to take full advantage of. Willett had previously struggled with a back problem. \u201cA big part of my year is my weeks off and trying to get the fitness levels good,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously spending time at home, making sure you get some good quality time at home and when I\u2019m at home, making sure I get a lot of quality work on my golf so I can come out to relatively short spells instead of some guys, this is their fourth week in a row.\u201d Lee Westwood, Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez and Louis Oosthuizen were among those to miss the cut.", "title": "Rory McIlroy digs deep in Dubai to avoid cut and give himself a fighting chance", "sentences": ["Either for Rory McIlroy or the organisers of the Dubai Desert Classic, that is."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-05T15:26:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/05/joseph-obrien-cheltenham-festival-ivanovich-gorbatov", "tags": ["Cheltenham Festival 2016", "Cheltenham Festival", "Aidan O'Brien", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "I haven\u2019t missed it yet,\u201d Joseph O\u2019Brien says of the career as a multiple Group One-winning Flat jockey that is now, at just 22 years of age, already behind him. Then again, he has probably not had time to miss it. A string of nearly 70 horses demands constant attention, above all when it includes a favourite for the Cheltenham Festival like Ivanovich Gorbatov, who goes on trial for the Triumph Hurdle at Leopardstown on Saturday afternoon. O\u2019Brien managed to squeeze two Derbys, two Irish jockeys\u2019 titles and wins at the Breeders\u2019 Cup and on Dubai World Cup night into a senior riding career which added up to about four seasons. Yet his height ensured that his time holding the reins was always going to be limited and his switch from rider to trainer has been a fact for several months, for all that it awaits the formal confirmation of a licence with Joseph\u2019s name on it.   Related: Ryan Moore taking over as Joseph O\u2019Brien struggles with weight    For the moment, the horses based at the O\u2019Brien\u2019s family home at Piltown in County Kilkenny, where both Aidan, his father, and Annie-Marie, his mother, have held the licence in the past, officially run in his father\u2019s name. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s priority, though, is Ballydoyle, the most successful stable in European Flat racing. The Piltown horses are prepared by Joseph, whose licence should finally be issued in April or May when he completes Horse Racing Ireland\u2019s course for new trainers. Given that he has been preparing for it all his life, gaining a pass is unlikely to be an issue. It will not arrive in time for Ivanovich Gorbatov to line up in the Triumph Hurdle as Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s first Cheltenham Festival runner, but he is as matter-of-fact about it as he always was about his brief window of opportunity in the saddle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019ll have it by then, but what can you do?\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI think how it works is that they have to wait until there\u2019s enough people wanting to do it to justify running the course. Hopefully, I\u2019ll have it soon. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll miss the riding at some point, but I\u2019m very happy doing what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m very lucky, I got to ride some great horses, I was in the right place at the right time, but I always knew that I wouldn\u2019t get to ride forever. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this for a long time.\u201d O\u2019Brien rode Ivanovich Gorbatov to win twice on the Flat, including a strong handicap at Leopardstown last August off a mark of 96. He looked like a natural recruit to jumping when he returned to the same track to win a maiden hurdle at the Christmas meeting, beating Let\u2019s Dance, the 4-7 favourite from the Willie Mullins stable, by an easy two lengths. The ease of his win alone would have been enough to shorten his Triumph Hurdle price, but for anyone who remembers the three-times Champion Hurdle winner Istabraq, the sight of Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s name against a hurdler in the JP McManus colours was a compelling image too. \u201cHe won nicely at Leopardstown and seems to be well since the race,\u201d Joseph O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of rain forecast for tomorrow and he\u2019ll probably be better when he gets nicer ground, but we hope that he\u2019ll run a good race. He needs the experience if he\u2019s going to go to Cheltenham, but he seems in good form and we couldn\u2019t be happier with him. I\u2019d suppose the best four-year-olds in Ireland will be running [on Saturday], but we\u2019d hope that he can run a very good race, and win, lose or draw, it\u2019s JP and Frank [Berry, his racing manager] that will decide about Cheltenham in the next week after. But if you\u2019re going to Cheltenham, you\u2019d like to be coming off a couple of wins in an ideal world. \u201cHe\u2019s only won a maiden hurdle, so obviously a lot of it [the short price] is based on hype. But he was always a natural jumper from day one. He\u2019s a hardy sort of a horse with a real forward-going attitude and things don\u2019t seem to faze him too much.\u201d Much the same is true of his trainer, who has considered riding some of his horses but prefers to concentrate on training instead. Having won Classics and jockeys\u2019 titles in the saddle, it is now possible that the first major success of his training career will come over jumps. \u201cWe\u2019ve about 60 or 70 horses here, mixed between Flat and National Hunt,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that training is any more or less satisfying [than riding], but you certainly have an awful lot more to do with each horse, you\u2019re seeing them every day and you deal with every little issue. \u201cI\u2019d love to ride them, but it\u2019s hard enough to do one thing properly without trying to do a couple of things right. I\u2019d rather be concentrating on one thing than trying to do everything, that\u2019s how I look at it. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much 50-50 here in terms of the jumpers and Flat horses, and I\u2019d find it hard to choose one or the other. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a jumper or a Flat horse.

How the Englishman comprehensively swatted aside any such notion with this, the biggest win of his professional career at the Dubai Desert Classic. The rapid rise of Willett shows no sign whatsoever of slowing in pace. The manner in which Willett triumphed in the Middle East was as notable as the fact that he did it at all. As he stood over a 10ft chance on the 72nd hole of the tournament, Willett knew Andy Sullivan and Rafael Cabrera-Bello had tied his 18 under par score. What happened next proved the epitome of calmness \u2013 Willett rolled in his birdie putt for a win which firmly endorsed already strong Ryder Cup prospects. It would count as a major surprise if Willett doesn\u2019t form part of Darren Clarke\u2019s contingent. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic,\u201d Willett said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy that feeling; coming down the back nine, the back three, in contention. It\u2019s something that you can\u2019t pay for in life, you\u2019ve got to earn it. \u201cIt is nice to know that I can dig deep there and produce what I can. Finishing in that way was brilliant.\u201d Willett could have taken up status on the PGA Tour but, with the Ryder Cup in mind, has opted to maximise his playing opportunity in Europe this season. It is a smart move; others have initially struggled when moving to the US and the Yorkshireman will have further scope to play in the States, once an appearance at Hazeltine in September has been marked upon his CV. Willett will leap, possibly as high as five places, from his current world ranking position of 20th. He has banked \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3307,000), which will come in useful with a first child due next month. In proving a player for all environments, the 28-year-old has secured European Tour victories in Germany, South Africa, Switzerland and now Dubai. Willett is the third English winner of the Desert Classic, after Mark James in 1989 and David Howell in 1999. Another couple of his compatriots, Chris Wood and Tyrrell Hatton, tied eighth here. Willett recalled: \u201cWhen we were at the [amateur] home internationals matches 10 years ago, it was pretty strong teams from all countries. \u201cAnd I think that the England lads, they are now kind of just feeding off each other. You look at the likes of Sully and Woody and myself, Matt Fitzpatrick as well in the EurAsia Cup, it was good fun to be in and around it, having a good craic and a good bit of banter with the lads. I think for the next few years, we\u2019re going to be the ones that are trying to beat each other. \u201cI think that European golf is strong. It\u2019s young but it\u2019s really strong. I think you saw that in the EurAsia Cup; that you just had a really thirsty group of lads there. The young British lads are just going to keep progressing, and I can see it being very competitive for the next few years.\u201d Willett, who started day four with a one-shot lead, was joined but never headed at the summit of the leaderboard. His 69 on Sunday was bettered by a shot by Sullivan with Cabrera-Bello\u2019s share of second coming after a three-under-par round of his own. Sullivan battled what he described as \u201cdriver demons\u201d throughout his last 18 holes. Sullivan said: \u201cI had the lead in Abu Dhabi after 36 holes and put myself in a real good position for the finish today. I just need to keep putting myself in that position and eventually I\u2019ll get over the line.\u201d There was a spell in which the most unlikely of Rory McIlroy triumphs looked possible. The Northern Irishman had to make do with a 65 and a share of sixth place; it is no exaggeration to point out he had been on course to threaten Willett at one stage, before falling short. McIlroy said: \u201cIt\u2019s a week of what could have been. There was a lot of really good golf in there. I played a lot of great shots and made a lot of birdies but just made a few too many mistakes as well. \u201cI\u2019ll rue the two front nines that I played on Friday and Saturday. I played the combined front nine five over par there and if I had not done that, things could have been different. But I\u2019m encouraged with the good golf that I\u2019ve played. It\u2019s been good because I know what I need to work on over the next few weeks.

We\u2019d love to hear your responses to these stories, and any others you\u2019ve read recently: share your thoughts in the comments below. Tokyo\u2019s flood-defence city When cities are threatened by floods, the obvious response is to build a wall \u2013 while other solutions may include creating permeable waterfront parks or floodable public spaces. However, one proposal for Tokyo, a city particularly prone to the impact of rising tides and rainfall, takes flood defences to a whole new level. As CityMetric explains, the \u201cNext Tokyo 2045\u201d proposal \u2013 designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates with Leslie E Robertson Associates, and purely at concept stage \u2013 involves the creation of a whole new city, built on reclaimed islands in Tokyo Bay, to defend against floods.  Arranged in a series of hexagons to form a barrier that minimises the impact of large ocean waves, the proposed \u201ccity\u201d would include a mile-high skyscraper to house thousands of residents \u2013 which, as an excited Daily Mail and Metro point out, would become the world\u2019s first mile-high tower, and twice the height of Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa. Which again prompts the question: how much higher can skyscrapers go? Night mayors Should cities have dedicated 24-hour areas where the night-time economy can flourish without disturbing the majority of the city\u2019s residents? That\u2019s the opinion of Amsterdam\u2019s very own \u201cnight mayor\u201d and former club promoter, Mirik Milan. But as he explains, it\u2019s not all about bars and clubs: \u201cYou could have working spaces there, and a library open 24 hours a day for students,\u201d Mirin tells CityLab.  The night mayor\u2019s role in the Dutch capital, created in 2014, involves managing and improving relations between night businesses, residents and city government. Thus far it seems to have worked so well in Amsterdam that other European cities are following suit: Paris, Toulouse and Zurich now all have night mayors, while London and Berlin are considering introducing them. Greening Madrid     A man jogs in Retiro Park, Madrid, Spain. Photograph: Alamy    Madrid\u2019s walls, roofs and unused spaces are soon to be covered with greenery in a bid to improve the city\u2019s climate resilience and help reduce the impact of extreme weather such as floods and heatwaves. As Fast Co Exist reports, 22 vacant lots in the Spanish city will be transformed into urban gardens, paved squares will become parks and river banks will be lined with trees. Roads may even be turned into linear parks as Madrid progresses with its city-centre ban on private cars. The series of green interventions are being undertaken by global engineering and design firm Arup. By creating green roofs and walls through extensive planting, buildings can save energy through insulation, air pollution can be mitigated and the carbon footprint of the city can be reduced. Shading from trees brings down local temperatures and the general increase in green coverage means water can be absorbed and stored after heavy rains, reducing the risk of flooding. It\u2019s also hoped that a greener Madrid will improve wellbeing among its citizens. Copenhagen: perfect after all? Copenhagen is often celebrated as the model of sustainable urbanism that other cities should look to learn from. But, as Feargus O\u2019Sullivan argues in Next City, even Copenhagen can make mistakes.  \u201cThe urbanism movement\u2019s model city is not immune to the challenges of growth, climate change and increasing economic disparity,\u201d writes O\u2019Sullivan, citing the fractures caused by Copenhagen\u2019s plans for a new harbour tunnel and its housing strategy among other issues. If the new harbour tunnel is built, the city known for cycling and pedestrianisation could end up being \u201cflooded\u201d with cars. And as housing demand exceeds the rate of construction, costs of homes are skyrocketing \u2013 while some of Copenhagen\u2019s key housing projects are targeted at the wealthy minority. Porto Alegre\u2019s resilience roadmap Last week, Porto Alegre announced its \u2013 and Latin America\u2019s \u2013 first resilience strategy, and committed 10% of the city\u2019s budget towards \u201cimproving resilience\u201d. Writing in Next City, Gregory Scruggs explains that the Brazilian city\u2019s strategy involves working towards a \u201cculture of peace\u201d, regularising land tenure, improving urban mobility and creating a \u201cdynamic innovation ecosystem\u201d, focused on revitalising an area of industrial land near the city centre called the 4th District. To design the new strategy, the city used the networks established by its celebrated process of participatory budgeting. \u201cThe policy, whereby the city is divided into 17 regions and everyday citizens have a say in how municipal funds are allocated among them, put the city on the map in the 1990s,\u201d writes Scruggs. \u201cThe project team made a conscious effort to solicit ideas directly from the participatory budgeting regions, rather than show up with their own preconceived plans.\u201d On commuting And finally: the morning commute can induce an array of emotions and sensations: anxiety, exhaustion, claustrophobia, irritation, boredom ... But for the lucky few, it can also offer a peaceful moment of reflection. A chapter from the Book of Life captures one experience of commuting to London:  The train moves off, resuming its rhythmical clicking along tracks laid down a century and a half ago, when the capital first began plucking workers from their beds in faraway villages. Familiar vignettes stream by outside: a power station, a patch of waste ground, a postal depot, a copse of ancient trees, a group of schoolgirls in grey-and-blue uniforms, a band of cumulus clouds spreading from the west, a shopping mall across a motorway, some underwear swaying on a line, and then gradually, the backs of suburban villas, heralding the train\u2019s arrival into central London itself.

Best, then, to stay in and settle down with some enthralling stories about everyone\u2019s favourite subject: sports administration. Giles Clarke, erstwhile chairman of the ECB, wannabe chairman of the ICC, has been known to tell journalists not to bother with the business of cricket. In the documentary Death of a Gentleman he tells the two filmmakers Sam Collins and Jarrod Kimber: \u201cPeople are not interested in cricket administration, and why should they be?\u201d The man has a point. No one ever fell in love with cricket because they loved reading about its various committees. Done right, cricket administration should be the dull and worthy work of unobtrusively efficient men and women. A necessary part of the sport, but, like the intricacies of Duckworth-Lewis calculations and an understanding of the respective merits of different varieties of grass, not one that need overly interest the average fan. Done wrong, however \u2026 For the last decade or so \u2013 ever since, oddly enough, it became clear that there was oodles of money to be made in T20 \u2013 cricket has been the backdrop for a fantastically entertaining soap opera. A little less brutal than The Sopranos, a little more convoluted than The Wire, a lot more ludicrous than Empire, I\u2019d strongly recommend it as Your Next Box Set, if you happen to have recently finished Netflix\u2019s excellent Making a Murderer. At the heart of it is the interminable conflict between two Texan Oil Families, the Ewings and the Barneses rival factions in the upper echelons of the BCCI and their assorted allies around the world as they fight for the right to control the global game. The series has stretched on so long that the plot is too labyrinthine to recount in any great detail. But \u2013 SPOILER ALERT! \u2013 here is a brief recap of some of the key characters, their best and most surprising moments from the show\u2019s last 10 years. Early series charted the rise of the slick young businessman Lalit Modi, mastermind of the new Indian Premier League, his alliance with the scandal-prone Indian politician Sharad Pawar, and the downfall of their rival, BCCI grandee Jagmohan Dalmiya. \u201cA worthy opponent\u201d, as Modi said when Dalmiya died last year. Dalmiya was outmanoeuvred and expelled from the BCCI board after he was accused of misappropriating funds. He spent the next few seasons caught up in a fight to clear his name, the first of the series\u2019 incessant high court subplots. Meanwhile, in England, we were introduced to the recently elected ECB chairman Clarke, a middle-aged businessman who made his money running a pet store. The ECB had once been the most powerful board around but were now a fading force. Clarke, mindful that Modi was looking to expand into new territories, was trying to find a way to shore up the ECB\u2019s position against this new threat. This was the catalyst for one of the show\u2019s outstanding storylines. The writers introduced the memorable character of \u2018Sir\u2019 Allen Stanford, a charismatic Texan financier who lived aboard a yacht moored off his compound on the island of Antigua. Stanford, of course, enticed Clarke into a partnership by promising to stake millions of dollars on the outcome of a single match between England and his own Super Stars team. In a twist some critics later claimed to have seen coming, Stanford turned out to be a conman. His billion-dollar business was, in fact, just a massive Ponzi scheme. The series ended with Stanford being sentenced to 110 years in jail. Stanford recently returned for a cameo from his cell. He spent it rabbiting on about how he was actually an innocent man. A little like the second coming of \u2018Nasty\u2019 Nick Cotton to EastEnders, this felt like a fairly transparent attempt to boost flagging ratings. Clarke was left casting around for a new ally. Fortunately, he soon found one. Because, back in India, a new character had come to the fore. His name was Narayanaswami Srinivasan. He had an extraordinary backstory, which included accusations that he was violently homophobic. These were made by his son, Ashwin. \u201cI was kept under house arrest for two years,\u201d Ashwin said in 2012, \u201cwhere I was given drugs by my father to make me straight.\u201d Srinivasan senior has repeatedly denied the charges. Otherwise, he was busy engineering his own rapid rise up through the BCCI, from treasurer in 2005, to secretary in 2008, to president in 2011. To get there, he had to get past Modi, who had been an ally of his in the early years. The internecine feud between the two was a key feature of the gripping middle seasons. In one of the most dramatic moments in the show\u2019s history, Modi was eventually deposed the day after the 2010 IPL final. He was expelled from the BCCI, and relocated to London. Modi has spent the years since in exile, plotting his revenge. Srinivasan, meanwhile, forged ahead towards his ultimate goals of controlling the IPL, the BCCI, the ICC, and world domination. He finally achieved this early in 2014, when, with the support of Clarke and the amiable old Australian buffer Wally Edwards, he staged a takeover at an ICC board meeting in Dubai. But, estranged from his own son, Srinivasan invested too much trust in his bone-headed son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, and gave him a senior role on his IPL team, the Chennai Super Kings. Meiyappan was then arrested and found guilty of charges of betting and passing on information to illegal bookmakers \u2013 and was banned from all cricket-related activities for life. And hard as Srinivasan fought to hold on, his grip on the game began to slip. In 2014, pressure applied by the Supreme Court \u2013 who accused Srinivasan of a \u201cnauseating\u201d conflict of interest \u2013 forced him to give up his position with the BCCI. A year later, he was dethroned from the ICC too. Of course these are only the broad strokes. There have been dozens of other storylines and subplots along the way, and hundreds of incidental characters. Fan favourites include the buffoonish Ijaz Butt, and the long-running joke about the contest between Zaka Ashraf and Najam Sethi for the chairmanship of the PCB, the slapstick exploits of Peter Chingoka at Zimbabwe Cricket, the ousting and excommunication of the former ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat, and the appearance of the mysterious multimillionaire Subhash Chandra and his Essel Group, with their odd promises of a new rebel league. All part of what you might call the programme\u2019s rich tapestry. Which brings us right up to the latest development, the rise of Shashank Manohar, the man who has taken over from Srinivasan at both the BCCI and ICC. Manohar has been a recurring character, but has never really caught the public\u2019s imagination. He is a lawyer. They say he likes sweets, owns a couple of nice cars, doesn\u2019t own a cell phone, and didn\u2019t even have a passport until 2007. He doesn\u2019t like the limelight. He has promised to reform both the BCCI and the ICC. Last week, he announced that he intends to lead \u201ca complete review\u201d of the changes made by Srinivasan, Clarke, and Edwards in 2014. He has said that the ICC must be more independent, and so from now on all future chairmen will have to give up their jobs with their domestic boards. He has said that the ICC must be more transparent, and so from now on all Full Member boards will have to present audited accounts on an annual basis. And he has said \u201cno Member of the ICC is bigger than the other\u201d, and so he has stripped England, Australia, and India of their permanent positions on the Executive Committee and the Financial &amp; Commercial Affairs Committee. All of which sounds a little too sensible. Manohar comes across like an actual sports administrator, not a star in a popular soap opera. He seems to believe that it is his business to be efficient, unobtrusive and even-handed. His reign promises to be good for the game, but terrible for the ratings. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

The States of Guernsey, which governs the island, has been examining the possibility of taking in about 20 Syrian refugees for several months. There are problems. For a start, Guernsey\u2019s status as a crown dependency, within the British isles but not part of the UK or the EU, means the mechanism for accepting Syrians under the Westminster government\u2019s scheme is not straightforward.

Housing is another issue: Guernsey is well-heeled \u2013 the median average wage is about \u00a330,000 \u2013 but there is little social housing for those who are not rich. Schooling is free but it is possible that extra teachers would have to be hired to look after children who do not speak English.      Karen Le Page Photograph: Andrew Le Poidevin for the Guardian     Last week the Guernsey government announced it would not take in refugees under the UK government\u2019s Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme, saying it did not have the infrastructure to meet their needs and that there were legal and practical issues relating to refugee rights. But, the next day, Le Tocq gave a BBC interview in which he mentioned Islamophobia and the storm began.  \u201cI was really upset at that,\u201d said Karen Le Page, an administrator for a charity supporting adults with disabilities. \u201cI think it has made us look selfish, unkind.

That squad surely gives us a clue.   Related: Captain Paul Collingwood hails England's Twenty20 world beaters    It includes Liam Plunkett, who was called up only when it became apparent that Steven Finn would not be fit to return from a side strain in time for the games against South Africa, but who had to miss them anyway due to a thigh injury. The expectation is that Finn will be named in the World Cup squad since the participating nations have been assured that they are easily able to replace men deemed not to be fit at the start of the tournament, which begins for England in Mumbai on 16 March against West Indies. The squad for next week\u2019s games in South Africa also contains James Vince of Hampshire, who has played only three T20 matches for England, all of which were against Pakistan in the UAE. In those games Vince displayed a solid temperament when opening the batting. Since then he has more or less taken up residence in Dubai, plying his trade for the England Lions and, more recently, the Karachi Kings. It would seem mildly surprising to find Vince at the finals but England currently go about their business of selection methodically. So expect him to be there, as a back-up for the regular opening batsmen. The alternative would not be an old Hampshire colleague but an additional spinning option for Indian conditions. There are, of course, likely to be some notable absentees. Stuart Broad, a former England Twenty20 captain, has never missed the World T20 finals but he is only likely to make the trip this time if both Finn and Plunkett are deemed to be unfit. Jonny Bairstow has been timing the ball sweetly in South Africa but Sam Billings is the preferred option as a reserve keeper and a potential middle-order swashbuckler.

More than a million Syrian civilians are living in besieged towns and villages, according to the aid organisation Siege Watch, more than double the number listed in UN data. That number could rise sharply if the government troops advancing on Aleppo cut off the city\u2019s last supply line, with the UN warning on Tuesday that up to 300,000 civilians could be stranded in the city that was once Syria\u2019s biggest urban centre.  \u201cIf the government of Syria and allies sever the last remaining flight route out of eastern Aleppo city, it would leave up to 300,000 people still residing in the city cut off from humanitarian aid unless cross-line access could be negotiated,\u201d the UN said in an emergency bulletin on the situation.    Related: Aleppo siege looms as pro-Assad forces cut opposition supply lines    A major aid group working in the area told the Guardian that an even greater number of people \u2013 about 400,000 \u2013 were at risk. The UN warned that up to 150,000 refugees may also flee from Aleppo towards the border with Turkey, joining tens of thousands already living there in squalid camps. The use of \u201cstarve or surrender\u201d tactics by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad came under increased scrutiny after photos and videos emerged last month of the emaciated, desperate children of Madaya, where dozens of people are thought to have starved to death before an aid convoy was allowed through. Now those limited supplies are almost gone. \u201cToday I ate grass, to make the aid last longer,\u201d said a young teacher and activist in Madaya, who was one of the first to alert the world to the extreme deprivation in the former resort town. \u201cSome families have already run out. In 10 days most of us will have nothing to eat.\u201d The January shipment came too late to help some of the weakest people, and now the town is bracing for more losses. It is surrounded by minefields and snipers who are said to have killed several of the most desperate inhabitants as they tried to slip away.   Map showing location of Madaya in Syria   \u201cSince the aid entered Madaya, 16 men and women have died, and four children,\u201d said the teacher, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals against family members in government-controlled areas. The suffering is being mirrored across Syria, Siege Watch warned, saying the UN was failing to register more than half of the blockades and citing Madaya as one of the forgotten sieges.  \u201cThe scale of the crisis of besieged areas in Syria is far worse than the UN \u2026 has acknowledged,\u201d said the report by Siege Watch, an initiative organised by the Dutch charity Pax and the Syria Institute, a US non-profit research group.  \u201cNew data gathered by Siege Watch shows that there are well over a million Syrians under siege \u2026 The scope and severity of sieges across Syria continues to grow.\u201d The report added that the deliberate starvation of civilians was a war crime. The majority of people were under siege from government forces, with many also blockaded by Islamic State (Isis) fighters, the report said. In the city of Deir ez-Zor, Isis has more than 200,000 people under siege, but government forces are complicit in the suffering because they control the city\u2019s airport and have refused to allow aid flights to bring supplies for civilians, Siege Watch said.           Malnourished children reportedly trapped in Madaya, Syria    \u201cWhile the UN reporting describes Deir ez-Zor as being besieged by Isis, residents living there feel that they are besieged by both Isis and the Syrian military,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe Syrian government\u2019s actions towards the besieged neighbourhoods support this claim.\u201d Madaya was not listed as under a blockade in a year-end UN report on the situation in Syria, even though UN officials had known about the extent of suffering there for months. The UN now considers Madaya besieged and helped to organise the aid convoy in January. The Damascus suburb of Mouadamiya, where Siege Watch estimates that about 44,000 people are under siege, did not appear on the UN list in December either. A residents\u2019 committee earlier this month demanded UN help and accused it of \u201cignoring the suffering of the civilians ... until [they] are at the brink of death\u201d. The International Committee of the Red Cross considers the suburb besieged and delivered aid for thousands of people in recent days, Reuters reported. Not all the sieges are as severe as the blockade on Madaya. The Siege Watch report designates three tiers of intensity, as well as areas on a watch list of potential siege situations. It warns that the UN is overlooking some of the looser blockades, where black market traders and those with government links can smuggle food in to sell at \u201cextortive and predatory prices\u201d. These systems drain money from the area and ultimately lead to starvation, the report said. \u201cWhile these practices may prolong the decline of the humanitarian situation in the besieged areas, they do not change the end result,\u201d the report said. The group says its information comes from contacts on the ground. It plans to publish an estimate of the siege situation every three months.

Here\u2019s five reasons Hunt may not actually be the best minister in the world.   Related: Greg Hunt wins 'best minister in the world' for efforts to reduce carbon emissions    1. He approved the country\u2019s biggest coalmine, ignoring his own department\u2019s advice From the perspective of endangered reptiles in Queensland \u2013 or the climate \u2013 Hunt may not be the best minister in the world. In July 2014 Hunt gave federal environmental approval to Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland, which would be the country\u2019s biggest coalmine and would create more emissions that New York City.  But the approval didn\u2019t last long. It was overturned a year later when the federal court ruled that Hunt had ignored his own department\u2019s advice about the mine\u2019s impact on two vulnerable species, the yakka skink and the ornamental snake. After imposing a few more conditions to protect the reptiles, the mine was approved again in August 2015. That only left environmentalists worrying about the mine\u2019s impact on the world\u2019s carbon budget and the Great Barrier Reef. 2. Carbon emissions in Australia are going up While many Australians were preparing their Christmas feasts, the government quietly dropped a report showing Australia\u2019s emissions rose in the year to July 2015. Fresh from their trip to Paris where Hunt and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, agreed to limit global warming to 2C, or maybe even 1.5C, the timing of the release raised eyebrows. Despite the emissions going up, Hunt was able to tell the Paris climate change conference that Australia had already met its 2020 emissions reduction target \u2013 which they say is 5% below 2000 levels. The reason is that Australia did better than it said it would at Kyoto, and can count the \u201covershoot\u201d as a reduction in the period to 2020. But unlike any other developed country, Australia committed to increase emissions at Kyoto. In summary, we get to say we cut emissions, despite our emissions rising, because they rose a bit less than we said they would.  3. The Great Barrier Reef is in bad shape After intense lobbying, Hunt was successful in keeping the reef off Unesco\u2019s world heritage in-danger list, although it was clearly on the brink and Australia will have to report back to Unesco in December. Government\u2019s scientists have warned the reef is in poor and deteriorating condition, with climate change the leading long-term threat. Pollution flowing from land, cyclones and a plague of coral-eating starfish are also serious threats. Meanwhile, several port developments along the Great Barrier Reef will bring increasing shipping traffic and the risk of an oil spill. And notoriously, Hunt has approved plans for dredging at Abbot Point, inside the reef\u2019s world heritage area, which scientists say will damage coral. 4. He was instrumental in dismantling the carbon tax, despite writing a thesis backing it Hunt and Tony Abbott came to government and put a bulldozer through many Labor government initiatives, chief among them the dreaded carbon tax, which was later linked to the biggest drop in emissions in a decade. But his vociferous criticism of the tax looked a little odd, given what he said in his university thesis about a carbon tax: \u201cUltimately it is by harnessing the natural economic forces which drive society that the pollution tax offers us an opportunity to exert greater control over our environment.\u201d 5. He is trying to shut-up annoying greenies Environmentalists seem to be an annoyance to Hunt. So, in several ways, he and his colleagues are trying to minimise their impact. In 2014 Hunt was worried that ignoring environmental advice from his department could allow environmental groups to challenge his rulings in court. So he passed a bill \u2013 with Labor\u2019s support \u2013 granting himself retrospective immunity against appeals on that basis. It fits in a larger fight his government has had with environmental groups waging so-called \u201clawfare\u201d, where they challenge the legality of developments in court. Hunt and his colleagues sought to tighten the definition of an \u201cinterested party\u201d under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, meaning environmental groups wouldn\u2019t have standing in court. And if that\u2019s not enough to shut up greenies, Hunt\u2019s colleagues have also looked at cancelling the tax-deductible status of donations to environmental groups, as well as outlawing secondary environmental boycotts.             In a video posted by the summit, Greg Hunt tells the people of the United Arab Emirates they should be \u2018immensely proud\u2019 of the forum. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said of Hunt\u2019s award: \u2018I\u2019d like to see what competition he was up against\u2019 ", "title": "Five reasons Greg Hunt may not be the best minister in the world", "sentences": ["\u201cThe aim of this award is to recognise innovation in global government work and highlight ministerial initiatives that have resulted in positive changes in their communities,\u201d the United Arab Emirates minister of cabinet affairs, Mohammed Al Gergawi, said as he gave Hunt the award in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-10T02:29:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/10/golf-rory-mcilroy-irish-open-phoenix-open", "tags": ["Golf", "Rory McIlroy", "European Tour", "Sport", "US sports", "Danny Willett"], "article": "An antidote to tales of golf\u2019s demise, added to further examples of the sport working for a greater good, arrived once again from Arizona at the weekend. The Waste Management Phoenix Open has not so much evolved as a tournament since moving to Scottsdale in 1987 as blasted into a fresh commercial stratosphere. The numbers attached to this event are quite staggering.   Related: Rickie Fowler beaten in playoff by Hideki Matsuyama at Phoenix Open    It has become self-fulfilling; this is one stop on the PGA Tour that spectators are desperate to play a part in. The tournament has been dubbed the \u201cbiggest party\u201d in golf. Attendance figures regularly reach half a million. Last week, almost 30,000 turned up for a Tuesday practice day; that figure rose to 58,000 on Wednesday, while the tournament\u2019s first day proper had a crowd of 101,021 and Friday\u2019s golf was watched by 160,415. Saturday? 201,000, reckoned to be the largest in the history of golf. By the time Hideki Matsuyama had beaten a tearful Rickie Fowler in a play-off, an aggregate crowd of 618,365 had been recorded, beating the 2015 record of 564,368. Placed in some context, the elongated Open Championship at St Andrews last July pulled in 237,000. Also in 2015, the Thunderbirds charity group \u2013 which distributes its share of income from the golf to needy causes \u2013 dished out $9m, which equated to all of the tournament\u2019s profit. That figure is sure to increase this time around. Thunderbirds Charities was established in 1986 with the sole aim of using money from the tournament to \u201cassist children and families, help people in need and improve the quality of life in our communities\u201d throughout Arizona. The endearing news is that others are looking to take inspiration from an alluring PGA Tour stop, which was once little more than a tiny spot in the desert. Barry Funston, the chief executive of Rory McIlroy\u2019s charity foundation, attended the Phoenix Open at the weekend with the specific intention of meeting with Thunderbirds and learning what has made the tournament such a success on all levels. The link is straightforward; the Rory Foundation\u2019s hosting of the Irish Open, as now sponsored by Dubai Duty Free, last year at Royal County Down saw fresh life breathed into an event which had earlier become worryingly stagnant. McIlroy\u2019s involvement should form part of his professional legacy; his ambitions to grow the tournament are obvious even in brief conversation. There are now under 100 days until the K Club hosts the 2016 version. McIlroy, it is clear, wants the Irish Open to build on last year\u2019s success. Taking notice of what happens in the providing of arguably the finest fan experience in golf makes perfect sense. The added connection, of course, comes by way of charity benefits.     Rory McIlroy wants to make the Irish Open \u2018bigger and better\u2019. Photograph: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cMy commitment to making the Irish Open as successful as it can possibly be is well known,\u201d McIlroy explained. \u201cIf we can learn anything at all from such a huge event on the PGA Tour, that can only be a good thing. I was delighted the foundation was given the chance to learn more about what has made Phoenix so popular. \u201cLast year at Royal County Down was a massive success but that was just the start of my involvement in the tournament. Any opportunity we have to make it bigger and better, we will look to maximise.\u201d Two simple factors play a part in this booming Phoenix scenario. Firstly, the golf is brilliantly priced; free entry on Tuesday, $30 tickets on Wednesday and Thursday and $40 from Thursday onwards. Under-17s with adults can attend for free. Among those who should take note of fair, attractive cost is the R&amp;A, which continues to charge like the Light Brigade for Opens. The wider point is that what Phoenix hosts feels like a major event. For too long, and in too many places, those organising golf tournaments have believed the appearance of the sport\u2019s biggest names in immaculate surroundings should be enough to thrill the masses. This constitutes laziness, if not negligence. It represents an antiquated business model; not only does golf have more competition than ever before for people\u2019s time, money and attention, but those watching want more.

Some 15,000 fans are routinely crammed around that one hole, plus extensive corporate boxes which are greatly sought after by blue-chip companies. That exact scene probably can\u2019t be replicated elsewhere but it is an annual example of what happens when the public imagination is captivated, as assisted by golfers who clearly revel in the atmosphere. Tiger Woods\u2019s hole-in-one at the 16th, back in 1997, remains a marquee moment and one which undoubtedly played its own part in catapulting the tournament narrative. Golf has sufficient stories of woe for the positives to be accentuated when they arrive. Phoenix is the latter; a wonderful tale of making the sport in competitive form work. It should be hailed as thus.

Quality and impact: the solution should address the needs of the citizens and must demonstrate a significant social impact. Significant social impact includes but is not limited to easily accessible government services for all citizens, efficiency in execution, human development impact, job creation, etc. Replication: the solution must have the quality of being easily replicated in multiple geographies. The solution should demonstrate propensity for impact beyond the local level, either nationally, regionally or globally. Reputation: the candidate must be highly credible amongst his peers and the general public. The candidate must have a proven record amongst his peers of developing innovative solutions that have positively impacted the citizens.  \u201cThe aim of this award is to recognise innovation in global government work and highlight ministerial initiatives that have resulted in positive changes in their communities,\u201d the UAE minister of cabinet affairs, Mohammed Al Gergawi, told the summit as he gave Hunt the award. \u201cOur world today needs ministers to serve as role models of thought and action, which bring about progress and welfare and improve general societal wellbeing.\u201d Official statistics released in December revealed Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions increased in the year to the end of June 2015 by 0.8% and by 1.3% when land use and deforestation were taken into account.

Andrew Jennings founded the business in 2012, selling exclusively online before branching out into a London retail store and more recently one in New York. The business also trades internationally via pop-up outlets in locations such as Paris and Stockholm, and is in talks with retailers in Japan and China. \u201cIt\u2019s important to gather as much local consumer insight as possible,\u201d Jennings says. Before opening its first overseas store in New York, Larsson &amp; Jennings closely monitored its e-commerce traffic and sales, then used pop-up shops to further gauge demand before committing to something more permanent. It also sought expert advice from someone with strong retail experience in the US. \u201cThis combination of approaches gave us the confidence to put our overseas expansion plans into action,\u201d Jennings says. Seek expert advice There is plenty of help available. STORY mfg. is a new sustainable fashion brand in London. Having built up a profile via social media, and initial sales through its web store including an international shipping option, the company sought help from the government\u2019s UK Trade &amp; Investment department (UKTI) to sell in a more structured way overseas, using retail partners with a higher profile. The company\u2019s first break came when it was approached by online clothing retailer LN-CC. \u201cWorking with such a well-known retailer gave us the confidence and capital to catapult us into wholesale, and we began showing at trade fairs last season in a very small way,\u201d explains Katy Rutherford, co-owner of STORY mfg.  With UKTI\u2019s help, STORY mfg. has expanded its reach to the US and beyond in a way it could not have done otherwise, she notes. \u201cWith support from UKTI London we recently showed at Liberty Fairs in New York, where we were given the chance to meet with buyers from some of the biggest department stores in the world.\u201d UKTI is also helping to maximise STORY mfg.\u2019s exposure via social media, where the company continues to build its brand. \u201cAs we\u2019re a visual business, Instagram has been the perfect medium for us, getting the word out to potential customers,\u201d Rutherford says. \u201cPosting on the @storymfg page is important.

Since starting up just over a year ago, the business, which now also sells through mainstream retailers including Selfridges and Ocado, has completed its first export to Dubai and is about to move into the US market. \u201cFor a small retailer, exporting can be fraught with red tape and with so much potential it\u2019s difficult to know where to start,\u201d says co-founder Nick Coleman. So the company began swapping notes with established UK-based food exporters such as Airberg. \u201cThey know the markets, understand the challenges to be aware of, as well as practical elements \u2013 such as shipping the product and all the paperwork that goes with it,\u201d he notes.  This insight has allowed Snaffling Pig to prepare for market-specific requirements. Although Dubai was straightforward, the company must redesign its packaging for the US to address US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules. \u201cSupport from other coal-facing exporters has helped us build a realistic roadmap to expand into this market,\u201d Coleman says. Choosing a sales route The next decision is how to enter the new market. Sporting goods retailer Faction Skis started using distributors in the majority of its target markets, seeing this as a quick, easy and low-risk strategy to expand abroad.  The company, which creates skis and clothing using innovative materials including carbon and recycled plastic, decided to go global from the start. Backed by \u00a3775,870 raised via crowdfunding platform Crowdcube last year, Faction Skis already sells to 31 countries. \u201cUsing distributors seemed easiest \u2013 ie letting someone else break open the market and position you, while you just cash the cheques,\u201d says the retailer\u2019s chief executive Alex Hoye.  But this approach brought its own issues. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s not that straightforward,\u201d Hoye says. \u201cOne by one, we\u2019ve taken back nine of the 10 top markets that make up over 90% of our worldwide sales.\u201d Now, the business supplies retailers directly. \u201cThis gives us control of the message, control of the positioning and the ability to invest in marketing beyond what a middleman can afford - because we have the long-term perspective.\u201d The company also maintains its own web presence to promote its products, an area where it has had to tread carefully as customers can access the site from any market \u2013 a potential source of conflict with other retailers. \u201cIn the early days, our partners were nervous about us selling side-by-side with them,\u201d Hoye admits. \u201cBut we were clear that we would maintain a respectful price floor, enabling them to sell through ahead of us. And actually the depth of information and imagery we put on the website helps drive sales by our retail partners and is a good support to them.\u201d Optimising your web site Whatever the final route, having a good website is important. Rebecca Kiff is an interiors and clothing brand. In addition to designing and printing goods in the UK and selling these via its website, it has built up overseas business over the past two years via local outlets in Australia, Japan, the US, France and Finland. \u201cPart of this success has been the ability to quickly process and keep track of different orders, thanks to the e-commerce platform I use [Weebly],\u201d she says. \u201cIts shop back-office enables me to set different profiles and contact forms for each country. I can control shipping rates and change the status of orders, smoothing the whole process.

It was a tweet that meant little but you suspect Koukash\u2019s social media offerings after Thursday night\u2019s match will be slightly more complimentary.

Lui, the former North Queensland half-back who arrived in Super League with a considerable reputation, will grab most of the headlines after his two tries but this was as rounded a team performance as you are likely to see. \u201cRobert is obviously a very good player,\u201d Watson said afterwards. \u201cHowever, our middle men really stood up which allowed Robert and Michael [Dobson] to play.

By the time Percival was withdrawn midway through the second half, though, the game was over. A superb kick from Lui\u2019s half-back partner Dobson set the tone as he found Greg Johnson unmarked in the corner to break the deadlock and from there Salford never let up. They were 18-0 up after 12 minutes following tries for Craig Kocpzak and another from Lui before the visitors offered a brief response with an Alex Walmsley try. Luke Walsh was sent to the sin-bin on the half-hour and that allowed Salford the chance to kill off the game and tries from Niall Evalds and a second from Lui, both of which followed rampaging breaks from the winger Justin Carney, put them out of sight by the interval. Carney in particular was a sight to behold, looking every inch the winger he was at Castleford, terrorising the Saints defence almost every time he touched the ball. The second half was slightly more tolerable for Saints but the damage had long since been done. Adam Swift managed a consolation but tries from Adam Walne, an outstanding solo score from Dobson and a second for Evalds rubber-stamped a remarkable match for the Red Devils.

Sam Allardyce remains rightly proud of a managerial CV unblemished by the stain of a single relegation from the top tier but he now knows that, in accepting the Sunderland job last October, this record was placed under severe threat. When the former Bolton, Newcastle, Blackburn and West Ham manager strode into the Stadium of Light as Dick Advocaat\u2019s successor he joked about being \u201ca firefighter\u201d but, privately, the 61-year-old felt mid-table security should be well within his grasp. Five months on he finds himself enmeshed in the sort of situation that aspiring young coaches studying crisis management might find themselves facing during a particularly grisly role-play exercise.              His struggling club has just sacked one of its most gifted, if sometimes underachieving, creators after that player shocked directors by pleading guilty to a charge of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl and another of grooming. As if the termination of Adam Johnson\u2019s contract on Thursday evening was not enough of an upheaval for Allardyce he must prepare his stunned squad for Manchester United\u2019s visit on Saturday lunchtime. A day after the prosecution at Bradford crown court detailed its case against the former England winger \u2013 who went on trial on Friday after denying two further charges of sexual activity with a child \u2013 Sunderland will kick off against Louis van Gaal\u2019s side in desperate need of points. Second-bottom, four points adrift of 17th-placed Newcastle and with their manager stressing the importance of not being cast any further adrift, they have little margin for error. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d says Allardyce. \u201cThe longer you go without a win, the more pressure piles on you. The greater the pressure, the more likely it becomes that the lads can\u2019t handle it.\u201d Considering Sunderland had still to win a league game this season when Advocaat resigned, claiming the team was simply \u201cnot good enough\u201d to avoid falling into the Championship, Allardyce has arguably not done too badly. In 17 League matches he has registered five victories but, perhaps crucially, only two draws. The last point came at Liverpool last Saturday where Johnson stepped off the bench to score with a free-kick. Few suspected it would be his final appearance in a Sunderland shirt.   Related: Jermain Defoe: If Leicester can do it why can\u2019t Sunderland?    Yet as he sits at the club\u2019s Wearside training ground, nursing a cold and shivering slightly, \u201cFireman Sam\u201d refuses to feel sorry for himself and is creditably self-critical. \u201cHave I underachieved since I\u2019ve been here?\u201d muses a manager who has experimented with an eclectic assortment of formations and personnel combinations. \u201cI haven\u2019t got us out of trouble yet. Could I have done more? Maybe. Every manager tries to get the best out of their players but if those players don\u2019t do what\u2019s expected you do what I did in January \u2013 you move into the transfer market. I got four in [Wahbi Khazri, Dame N\u2019Doye, Jan Kirchhoff and Lamine Kon\u00e9] \u2026 but I was hoping to get more from the players already here. \u201cWe\u2019ve failed in defence more than anywhere else. We\u2019ve conceded too many goals and not got enough clean sheets. From my viewpoint, that\u2019s the biggest failure. Individual mistakes have cost us dearly. We try to show the players their responsibilities out of possession but they find that very difficult to cope with.\u201d Which all rather vindicates Advocaat\u2019s argument. Allardyce, who arrived on a mission to \u201cprove Dick wrong\u201d but soon found himself devoting endless hours to working on individual defenders\u2019 \u201cbasic body shape\u201d and positioning, offers a wintry smile when asked whether his predecessor had been right all along. \u201cI suppose my honest answer would have to be that, if I thought we were good enough, I wouldn\u2019t have entered the market,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big relief that, even having just arrived from abroad, the new players have already shown they\u2019ve got some real talent.\u201d Perhaps history is poised to repeat itself. After all, in recent seasons Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet and Advocaat each defied considerable odds to keep Sunderland in the Premier League courtesy of 11th-hour \u201cmiracles\u201d. Allardyce remains confident he can avoid becoming the odd man out. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt I can\u2019t keep us up \u2013 even when we lost five on the trot I always believed we could survive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe keep losing control and letting opponents kill us but there\u2019ve been glimpses of this team being capable and, every year about now, somebody in trouble always goes on a good run. You can never tell but it\u2019s been us in the past and I hope it\u2019s going to be us again.\u201d Outside, the thermometer is dropping towards freezing and the weak February sun has dipped low in the sky but, finally, he is smiling. In his mind Allardyce is on the steps of an aeroplane that has just landed in the restorative warmth of Arabia and his senses feel re-energised by the balmy desert breeze. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Dubai next week,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the players come back they\u2019ll be fitter, physically and mentally. It\u2019ll be 75 degrees and they\u2019ll need T-shirts and factor 25 rather than 16 jumpers, a hat and a scarf. It\u2019ll make them feel good and, if they feel good, you get more out of players.

When I tell her\u00a0that Jonathan Unleashed took me\u00a0by surprise, she is momentarily exasperated, protesting, \u201cWhy does everyone say they\u2019re surprised?\u201d But\u00a0after thinking for a minute, she concedes with a theatrical shrug, \u201cDoesn\u2019t everybody react with surprise every time I write a book?\u201d It was a very different type of book with which Rosoff made her debut in 2004. How I Live Now was a tale of adolescents abandoned in the English countryside as an incomprehensible war rages around them. Described by Mark Haddon as \u201cthat rare, rare thing, a\u00a0first novel with a sustained, magical and utterly faultless voice,\u201d it won a fistful of prizes and secured Rosoff a place in the front rank\u00a0of crossover novelists who were sweeping up both child and adult readers. It went on\u00a0to sell nearly 1m copies and last year was made into a film under the direction of Kevin Macdonald, with Saoirse Ronan as the protagonist, Daisy. How I Live Now established a Rosoff marque of thoughtful, borderline subversive stories with more style than plot, though not all her novels have been so serious: Vamoose (2010) was a black comedy involving a couple who have a moose instead of a baby; There Is No Dog (2011) posed the scenario of the whole of creation being placed in the hands of a petulant and hormonal teenage boy. All her novels feature animals, and Dante and Sissy in Jonathan Unleashed are the latest in a long line of canines, both physical and metaphorical, that romp through her work, making their first appearance in a description of Daisy\u2019s cousin Edmond at the start of How I Live Now: \u201cHe\u2019s exactly like some kind of mutt, you know the ones you see at the dog shelter who are kind of hopeful and sweet and put their nose straight into your hand when they meet you with a certain kind of dignity and you know from that second that you\u2019re going to take him home.\u201d Dante and Sissy, a sheepdog and a spaniel abandoned to Jonathan after his brother lands a job in Dubai, provide both a plot engine that drags their guardian through the wilderness of the\u00a0wrong job and wrong relationship, and a beady eye that gives the resulting comedy its perspective. With its compact sidewalk setting and kooky New York humour, it\u2019s no surprise to\u00a0learn that the novel was written with\u00a0more than half an eye on the film possibilities.     Saoirse Ronan and George MacKay in the film adaptation of How I Live Now.    In the Manhattan-style loft she shares with her husband and two lurchers in an ultra-urban corner of south London, Rosoff explains that the idea came out of a conversation with a friend, Michael Kuhn, one of the producers behind Four Weddings and a Funeral. \u201cI\u2019ve always asked him, \u2018What is your ideal?\u2019 And he said he\u2019d love a romcom with a twist. So I said, \u2018OK I\u2019m going to write one.\u2019\u201d Undaunted by his reaction, which was to laugh, she began to write, sending scenes as she went. He seemed uninterested and at first, she admits, there were problems. \u201cJonathan wasn\u2019t strong enough: when you have a very weedy, odd character you have to be careful that he doesn\u2019t come across as\u00a0whiny.\u201d Her old publisher, Penguin, also showed no interest, \u201cand I thought it was going to be the usual sweet book that nobody reads\u201d. But she kept faith with the story, and one final revision proved her dramatically right: \u201cThere was an explosion. Publishers and film companies were phoning up for it.\u201d In terms of publisher and market it is a new departure for Rosoff, who felt that her stock was drifting down with Penguin, from the dizzy heights of her early novels. \u201cI was getting quite fed up because I was on my fifth or sixth editor. It felt as if they had completely lost interest. The wheel was turning towards big volume, big sales, whereas I\u2019ve been writing quiet, fairly small-market books.\u201d   Related: Meg Rosoff: Do not be afraid to be afraid \u2013 the Philippa Pearce memorial lecture    Yet in the ordinariness of its setting and its animal-centricity, Jonathan Unleashed reflects preoccupations that go back to her own childhood as one of four daughters born into \u201ca nice Jewish family\u201d in suburban Boston. Her father was a doctor and she was the good daughter who did well at school and was animal mad. She took up horse-riding, suffering the first of several concussions, and helped out with the snakes at Boston science museum, \u201ccleaning the cages and hacking frozen cubes of baby birds apart to feed them\u201d. \u201cIt was all incredibly ordinary, and I\u00a0thought that was the kiss of death to ever being a writer,\u201d she says, with the characteristic Rosoff afterthought that it would be years before she discovered that \u201cthe best teacher I ever had in the\u00a0best school I went to in the best year of\u00a0my life had been jailed for paedophilia: so there were stories in\u00a0the boring suburbs.\u201d It was only after at she made it to Harvard that her life began to veer off the beaten track. Finding it \u201cjust too conventional\u201d, she dropped out for a\u00a0year, flew to London and signed up for a course in sculpture at St Martin\u2019s School of Art. Though she realised instantly that she wasn\u2019t cut out to be an artist, the experience changed her: she fell in love with England and went fashionably wild. \u201cThe dollar was strong, I had my hair cut at Vidal Sassoon, bought clothes from Camden market and came back to New York cool.\u201d She finished her degree but maintained her street cred by playing bass in a band. Like sculpture and riding, it was a hobby that was destined not to yield a vocation. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life being not very good at things but doing them with a mad passion.\u201d     Rosoff with her daughter, Gloria, in 2013. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian    Like Jonathan, she stumbled through her 20s in New York \u2013 \u201cI had no boyfriends and couldn\u2019t find a career or a place for myself in the world.\u201d So she returned to London, fell in love with an\u00a0artist, Paul Hamlyn, who is now her husband, and \u2013 like Jonathan \u2013 went to\u00a0work in advertising, where she remained for 15 years, despite being sacked numerous times. \u201cIt was sexist, idiotic and now I\u2019m proud of myself for getting fired so often, but at the time it\u00a0was just demoralising,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u00a0never occurred to me that having a decent intellect was a problem for being good at advertising because they are always trying to tell you what to do.\u201d One result was that, despite a successful marriage and the birth of a\u00a0much-loved daughter, she had \u201call this hate: it just felt like an adolescence that went on until my 40s\u201d. The event she credits with snapping her into adulthood, and a writing career, was the death of her youngest sister from breast cancer, which impressed on her that time was too precious to waste. She wrote How I Live Now in the gaps between working and caring for her daughter, and on the day the manuscript was sold, she resigned. By the time it was published, Rosoff was 47 years old and had herself been diagnosed with breast cancer. She arrived with her small daughter, Gloria, to collect the first of many awards, the\u00a0Guardian children\u2019s fiction prize, blanched by chemotherapy and frantically fending off well-wishers for fear that they would pass on an infection. \u201cIt was the dark and the light so intensely felt that impressed me,\u201d recalls the chair of judges, Julia Eccleshare. \u201cI\u00a0remember going to interview her and we started talking really seriously about life, death and what being a good person meant. All her books have this incredibly fierce interiority that propels them.\u201d    The children\u2019s world is getting far too literal. I really hate the idea that we need agendas in books    How I Live Now channelled Rosoff\u2019s self-professed bolshiness into the story of a scratchy, anorexic 15-year-old American who is sent to stay with her dead mother\u2019s family in the English countryside. It wasn\u2019t targeted at the YA market, and some of its elements were openly transgressive \u2013 not least the romance between Daisy and her 14-year-old cousin, Edmond. After the\u00a0success came the backlash. Isn\u2019t it interesting, she says now, that people were so troubled by the sexual relationship between cousins [which is legal in the UK], when nobody seemed to care that Daisy and Edmond were just 15 and 14 years old, or that part of Edmond\u2019s allure was that he was a chain smoker who always smelled of tobacco. The uncertainties of teenage sexuality, and the magnetism of outsiders are abiding themes, resurfacing in novels such as What I Was (2007), in which a disaffected public schoolboy becomes besotted with an androgynous loner who lives in a hut on the seashore. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0the story of teenagers struggling not only with sexuality but with gender identity, and, in terms of children\u2019s books, was ahead of its time,\u201d says Eccleshare. Nicholas Tucker, an academic and broadcaster specialising in children\u2019s books, believes the cancer diagnosis not only prompted Rosoff to\u00a0become a writer but has shaped what she has written, creating \u201ca\u00a0series of uncompromising novels\u201d. \u201cShe took on politics, atheism, bullying, but also horse-riding and animals in general. It could also explain why she sometimes goes in for rather rushed, happy endings that can contrast quite strongly with what has gone before. Because after all, she has to date had a happy non-ending herself.\u201d Tucker\u2019s sense that she \u201cdoes what she fancies, with no long-term strategy\u201d is echoed by Rosoff, who describes herself as \u201cnaturally lateral\u201d and says, \u201cI don\u2019t ever think about my audience.\u201d She fiercely resists any sense of literary obligation and believes that \u201cthe children\u2019s world is getting far too literal about what needs to be represented. I\u00a0really hate the idea that we need agendas in books.\u201d   Related: Meg Rosoff sparks diversity row over books for marginalised children    When she wrote as much on social media last year \u2013 questioning a US Kickstarter project to fund a book about \u201ca queer black five-year-old\u201d \u2013 she unleashed a Twitter storm that generated 30,000 hate tweets. \u201cI was utterly stunned by the level of vitriol. No one\u00a0was interested in a more subtle argument.\u201d It took her 24 hours to shrug it off as the narrow-mindedness of people who \u201cweren\u2019t readers, or not MY readers\u201d. She might have mellowed and lost\u00a0the hatred \u2013 \u201cit took 12 years to compost\u00a0down into the comedy of Jonathan Unleashed\u201d \u2013 but she remains brave and bolshy, impossible to predict or to pigeonhole. \u201cI think maybe I\u2019ve said mostly what I have to say about adolescence,\u201d she muses. \u201cBut more comedies for adults? Probably not. \u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019ve noticed that those who have the most in common are teenagers and people in their 50s who are getting divorced and asking the same basic questions: Will anyone love me?

Divestment arguments have often focused on the morality of investments, but the economic value of divestment has recently become hard to ignore. In January, portfolio planner Advisor Partners reported that, between 2014 and 2015, New York City\u2019s biggest pension fund lost $135m because of its fossil fuel holdings. And, earlier this month, Market Forces, an activist group that works in environmental finance, reported that fossil fuel investments cost 15 of Australia\u2019s top funds an estimated $5.6bn. On average, this cost each member of these funds $1,109.   Related: Sustainable investing: are companies finally moving money away from fossil fuels?    For a long time, the corporate case for sustainability has been focused more on public relations than profit. Companies that pursued sustainable policies, the reasoning went, benefitted by gaining valuable points with customers, avoiding embarrassing scandals and \u2013 especially in recent years \u2013 getting their pick of eager young millennial workers. But profitable sustainability is coming of age, at least as far as renewable energy is concerned. With the value of fossil fuel holdings plummeting and the profitability of renewables growing, investors and companies are increasingly looking to sustainable investments for good long term bets. At January\u2019s UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk \u2013 an event attended by 500 global investors representing an estimated $22tn in assets \u2013 most of the presenters shunted aside the standard public relations and millennial hire arguments in favor of an old fashioned look at profits and losses. And, as they made clear, companies and investors that shun sustainable, low-carbon assets stand to lose a lot of money. Michael Liebreich, chairman of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, explained the new math of fossil fuels. Coal, he pointed out, is losing value in every country except India. Gas prices have also fallen sharply, leading to a steep drop in investment. A recent Citibank report predicted that oil is likely to \u201cbottom out\u201d in 2016. And Bloomberg recently quoted Vitol oil holding group CEO, Ian Taylor, as saying that crude oil will likely stay at $60 a barrel for at least 10 years.  The rise of renewables On the other hand, renewable energy is becoming increasingly viable, a trend that could potentially be a game-changer for investors, particularly large scale, global investors like the ones attending the UN summit. The falling prices of renewables-generated electricity are pulling the rug out from under fossil fuels, which are getting priced out of the market. According to former vice president Al Gore, who also spoke at the UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk, solar power has been dropping by 10% per year. If this curve continues, Gore said, then its price is going to fall \u201csignificantly below the price of electricity from burning any kind of fossil fuel in a few short years\u201d. In some places, Liebreich said, this is already happening. A year ago, a solar project in Dubai went online, and offered electricity at a rate of $0.058 per KwH. \u201cThis was the solar equivalent of the shot that was heard around the world,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn the Middle East, a solar project was producing electricity more cheaply than you could produce it using natural gas.\u201d This month, Liebreich said, Morocco announced an offshore wind farm that will produce electricity for $0.03 per KwH. \u201cThis is probably the cheapest new electricity that you could build anywhere in the world,\u201d he said. And not only is this a boon for consumers, but it also sends a clear message to utilities. \u201cWhen you get electricity this cheaply, you have to buy some.\u201d The same thing is happening in the US. Gore pointed out that in Nevada, energy generators are selling solar electricity to utilities for $0.3 cents per KwH, a price well below that of coal-based electricity. And some utilities are even giving electricity away for free. Gore cited TXU, a utility in Texas. \u201cHere\u2019s their new rate plan: your rates will go up a little bit during the peak use periods during the day, but from 9pm until 6am the next morning, you can use all the electricity you want for free,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to get rid of it because it\u2019s too hard to turn off the turbines. And in south Australia and parts of Germany, they\u2019ve gone to negative rates for renewable electricity.\u201d The case for global investment Falling electricity prices are great news for companies that use electricity and bad news for investors with holdings in fossil fuels. But what about people who hope to invest in renewables?    Related: Copenhagen set to divest from fossil fuels    As several of the UN summit\u2019s participants pointed out, building a wind or solar farm requires a significant initial investment, after which the actual price of power generation will remain low indefinitely, as the sun will continue to shine on solar cells and the wind will continue to turn turbines. This is in stark contrast to fossil fuels, which require a large upfront investment for building power plants, followed by continued expenditure for extracting, transporting and burning fuel.  And investors have gotten the message: as the Financial Times pointed out last year, the six major renewable investment funds yield between 5.5% and 7% \u2013 attractive returns in the current market. Not surprisingly, there has been sharp growth in renewable generation. \u201cA dozen years ago, the best predictors in the world told us that the solar energy market would grow by 2010 at the incredible rate of 1 GW per year,\u201d said Gore. \u201cBy the time 2010 came around, they exceeded that by 17 times over. Last year, it was exceeded by 58 times over. This year, it\u2019s on track to be exceeded by 68 times over. That\u2019s an exponential curve.\u201d In 2015, global clean energy investment hit $329bn, its highest level ever. But, despite all evidence of value, many corporations and investors are still hesitant to invest in renewables, and they often charge outrageous interest for solar projects.  UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon emphasized that the recent COP21 summit \u2013 particularly the pledges made by companies and governments from around the world \u2013 could encourage investment in renewables. \u201cThe Paris agreement provides a durable, yet flexible framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are transparent rules of the road to monitor progress and enhance accountability.\u201d Ultimately, Moon says, both investors and corporations now have a signal that the time has come for them to direct their energies toward low-carbon, climate-resilient growth. \u201cIt marks the beginning of the end of growth built solely on fossil fuel consumption,\u201d he said. \u201cThe once unthinkable has now become unstoppable.\u201d", "title": "Have we reached the tipping point for investing in renewable energy?", "sentences": ["A year ago, a solar project in Dubai went online, and offered electricity at a rate of $0.058 per KwH."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-13T15:00:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/13/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-top-four", "tags": ["Louis van Gaal", "Manchester United", "Sunderland", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Louis van Gaal admitted Manchester United are unlikely to secure a top-four finish and described his side\u2019s 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Sunderland as a sad day for the club.

Van Gaal is well aware that the talk about Jos\u00e9 Mourinho succeeding him at Old Trafford in the summer is most certainly not going to go away after United\u2019s first defeat at the Stadium of Light. Damningly, United\u2019s points and goals scored tally is their lowest at this stage of a campaign in the Premier League era. \u201cWe can only blame ourselves,\u201d said Van Gaal, who did at least see Anthony Martial score a fine equaliser before his players folded under Sunderland\u2019s second-half onslaught. \u201cYou have to win this type of game but we could not cope with Sunderland\u2019s aggression and set pieces. We didn\u2019t deliver and we feel disappointed and we feel sad. But we are working together.\u201d   Related: Van Gaal would be disappointed if Manchester United have approached Mourinho    When asked if he was feeling the pressure, the Dutchman\u2019s reply suggested a measure of resignation. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing my work and I can do no more.\u201d He accepts, though, that his best currently represents underachievement. \u201cYou cannot close your eyes from the top four being a minimum requirement. As Manchester United you have to keep the ball in spite of the pressure of Sunderland and create chances, but we didn\u2019t have control.\u201d The result meant Sunderland ended a bad week with a measure of satisfaction, moving to a point below 17th-placed Norwich. The club sacked Adam Johnson after the winger pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. They head for a training break in Dubai within touching distance of safety and Allardyce was delighted to see his \u00a314m investment in Khazri, from Bordeaux, and Kon\u00e9, a centre-half from Lorient, pay dividends. \u201cOur new players have made a massive contribution and hopefully that bodes well for the rest of the season,\u201d he said. \u201cToday showed me the squad is good enough to get out of the trouble we\u2019re in.

The legal opinion by Geoffrey Robertson QC, a former UN judge, says the four businessmen \u2013 Salim Alaradi, who has Libyan and Canadian nationalities, Kamal and Mohamed Eldarrat, who have Libyan and US nationalities, and Issa al-Manna, a Libyan \u2013 have been wrongly accused of funding a terrorist organisation. They are due to go on trial in the secretive state security chamber court in Abu Dhabi on Monday. Alaradi was holidaying with his family at a beach hotel in Dubai when he was arrested last summer by the State Security Agency (SSA), according to Robertson\u2019s report. He was not permitted to notify his family or any lawyer of his arrest.  \u201c[Alaradi] was in secret detention \u2013 at an air force base, it is believed \u2013 [where] he claims he was tortured, a claim corroborated by serious bruising observed on his body, by similar claims by several of the men who were detained at the same time and have now been released, and by evidence of torture and ill-treatment in the UAE gathered by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch,\u201d the report states. Alaradi said he was subjected to sleep deprivation, chained in a stress position, hung upside down and beaten on the soles of his feet. \u201cHe was made to carry heavy weights while being beaten, subjected to waterboarding techniques and blasted for lengthy periods by ice-cold air,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHis brother was in an adjacent cell, and heard him screaming.\u201d  The organisations that they are alleged to have funded, the February 17 Brigade and Libya Dawn, are paramilitary forces that have been allied to the west and are not on the Libyan government\u2019s list of banned groups, according to Robertson. The UN working group on arbitrary detention (UNWGAD) will publish a report on the four men on Monday calling for their immediate release from custody. It says: \u201cAll of them were deprived of the right to challenge their arrest and detention before the judicial authorities and subjected to enforced disappearance, secret and incommunicado detention. [We] received reliable information on the acts of torture [inflicted on] the four victims...\u201d The report documents claims that the men were subjected to electric shocks, whipped, had guns held to their heads, were drugged and \u201chung with a rope around the neck\u201d. Some said they had been placed in a freezer for up to 45 minutes. In its response to the UN panel, the UAE said: \u201c[The four men] are completely free to choose, appoint and meet with a lawyer according to the rules of procedures governing correctional institutions.\u201d The UN working group is the same body that produced a critical report this month declaring that the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is resisting extradition to Sweden for questioning about an alleged rape, was being held under arbitrary detention in the UK.

Chastened, resigned, humbled even, Manchester United\u2019s manager cut a somehow diminished figure as he answered questions about his team\u2019s latest setback. Whether or not Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is to succeed him at Old Trafford, a coach who once revelled in being the Pep Guardiola of his day appears to accept the end-game has begun. Gone was the defiance, the bristling in the face of journalistic inquiries and, perhaps most startlingly, the old antipathy towards Sam Allardyce. After agreeing that, yes, it would be extremely difficult for United to finish in the top four this season, Van Gaal suggested their best route back into the Champions League would be by winning the Europa League before hastily offering a caveat. The standard of football in Europe\u2019s secondary competition is high, he cautioned, lifting the trophy cannot be seen as anything remotely near a foregone conclusion.   Related: Louis van Gaal admits \u2018sad\u2019 Manchester United unlikely to make top four    Last season he had taken offence when Allardyce, then in charge of West Ham, accused United of deploying long balls and subsequently produced diagrams intended to debunk that outrageous notion. Now, though, Van Gaal was praising an old foe, lauding the controlled aggression, stellar set-piece execution and accurate long-ball delivery of this relegation-threatened Sunderland side before acknowledging United were falling short of minimal expectations. \u201cThe top four will be very difficult now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot close your eyes to that. Everybody\u2019s very sad. We couldn\u2019t cope with Sunderland\u2019s aggression and set pieces. We didn\u2019t deliver and we feel disappointed and we feel sad. You cannot close your eyes from the top four being a minimum requirement.\u201d Seated on a little stage in the Stadium of Light\u2019s media room, Van Gaal looked tired. He seemed in need of some sun on his back and heat in his bones. Instead he must head to central Denmark where United play the first leg of their last-32 tie against Midtjylland on Thursday. In contrast Sunderland are bound for the bling and bright blue skies of Dubai, with Allardyce now confident the restorative properties of the Arabian sun will be transposed into relegation-averting points. After succeeding Dick Advocaat in October, he initially struggled to make the desired impact on Wearside but appears to have shopped very well in January. Here the outstanding Wahbi Khazri \u2013 a Tunisia playmaker signed for \u00a39m from Bordeaux \u2013 scored the opener courtesy of a curling, thoroughly deceptive, 30-yard free-kick and then delivered the corner from which Lamine Kon\u00e9\u2019s header forced David de Gea into an own goal. Although Anthony Martial registered a fine, delicately dinked and tightly angled, equaliser, the excellence of Kon\u00e9 \u2013 a \u00a35m purchase from Lorient \u2013 alongside John O\u2019Shea ensured Vito Mannone remained well protected. Despite United enjoying a period of first-half dominance, their passing was too slow and complicated to inflict serious damage on hosts who sensibly piled pressure on Van Gaal\u2019s novice full-backs, Donald Love \u2013 on after Matteo Darmian dislocated a shoulder\u2013 and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson. With Yann M\u2019Vila increasingly showing off his influential central-midfield poise, Sunderland were deserved winners at the end of an awful week dominated by the sacking of Adam Johnson. \u201cIt was a massive three points,\u201d said O\u2019Shea. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot closer to safety. We saw Wahbi\u2019s ability the minute he joined us, he puts in quality dead balls every time. He\u2019ll be a big asset, you can see us scoring a lot more goals from set pieces.\u201d It was Sunderland\u2019s first home league win against United since 1997 and O\u2019Shea, who spent so many years at Old Trafford as part of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s defence, was suitably delighted. \u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d he said. \u201cManchester United are still a very good team so we deserve a bit of credit but they don\u2019t have as many players as they used to and they aren\u2019t where they want to be in the table, that\u2019s for sure. Given the budget, the money spent, qualifying for the Champions League is the minimum expected of them, it\u2019s the given. But they\u2019ve lost some very important players to injuries and the quality of the Premier League is increasing, as is the intensity.\u201d A few yards away Allardyce was savouring the reality that O\u2019Shea and Kon\u00e9 had succeeded in making Wayne Rooney look ordinary. \u201cJohn and Lamine have struck up a good partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn will sweep around and cover, Lamine will head anything and intimidates centre-forwards.\u201d It was suggested Kon\u00e9\u2019s performance was reminiscent of those once produced in the 1970s and 1980s by a centre-half known as \u201cBig Sam\u201d. Sunderland\u2019s manager laughed. \u201cLamine\u2019s a bit better on the ball than me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy second touch was a tackle.\u201d Man of the match Wahbi Khazri (Sunderland)", "title": "Louis van Gaal accepts unhappy truth as Wahbi Khazri inspires Sunderland", "sentences": ["In contrast Sunderland are bound for the bling and bright blue skies of Dubai, with Allardyce now confident the restorative properties of the Arabian sun will be transposed into relegation-averting points."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-14T22:30:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/15/cnnmoney-business-news-to-roll-out-internationally", "tags": ["CNN", "Media", "TV news", "Television industry", "Business", "The news on TV", "US television industry"], "article": "CNN is to embark on a major revamp and expansion of its international digital and TV business news with the global roll-out of its CNNMoney brand.

Masdar City, when it was first conceived a decade ago, was intended to revolutionise thinking about cities and the built environment. Now the world\u2019s first planned sustainable city \u2013 the marquee project of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 (UAE) plan to diversify the economy from fossil fuels - could well be the world\u2019s first green ghost town. As of this year - when Masdar was originally scheduled for completion - managers have given up on the original goal of building the world\u2019s first planned zero-carbon city. Masdar City is nowhere close to zeroing out its greenhouse gas emissions now, even at a fraction of its planned footprint. And it will not reach that goal even if the development ever gets fully built, the authorities admitted. \u201cWe are not going to try to shoehorn renewable energy into the city just to justify a definition created within a boundary,\u201d said Chris Wan, the design manager for Masdar City. \u201cAs of today, it\u2019s not a net zero future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about 50%.\u201d   Masdar city map    When Masdar City began, in 2006, the project was touted as a model for a green mixed-use urban landscape: a global hub for the cleantech industry, with 50,000 residents and 40,000 commuters. Foster + Partners designed a car-free city scape, with Jetson-style driverless electric cars shuttling passengers between buildings incorporating built-in shades and kitted out with smart technologies to resist the scorching desert heat, and keep cooling costs down. Mubadala, Abu Dhabi\u2019s state-owned investment company, pledged financial support to the estimated $22bn experiment in urban design. Ten years on, however, only a fraction of the town has been built - less than 5% of the original six square km \u201cgreenprint\u201d, as Wan called it. The completion date has been pushed back to 2030. The core of Masdar City is in place, anchored by the large square-ish building that is the Middle East headquarters of Siemens. A 45-metre Teflon-coated wind tower helps channel cooling breezes down a shaded street equipped with a grocery store, bank, post office, a canteen, and a couple of coffee shops. As many as 300 other firms such as GE\u2019s Ecomagination and Lockheed Martin also have an official presence \u2013 though Wan acknowledged that in many cases that just amounts to a hot desk. The International Renewable Energy Agency took over the other major building for its shimmering steel headquarters last year. Irena chose Abu Dhabi as its base, after Masdar promised a state-of-the-art sustainable building. The six-storey headquarters uses only one-third of the energy of comparable office buildings in Abu Dhabi \u2013 thanks to air-tight insulation and high-efficiency elevators. The design rejected overhead lamps, to encourage use of natural lighting, and called for solar water heaters on the roof.     A wind tower within Masdar. The city has given up on its original aim to be net zero. Photograph: Clint McLean/Corbis    By UAE standards, both the Siemens and the Irena buildings are state-of-the-art in terms of optimising energy use \u2013 but it\u2019s less clear how they stack up globally. The UAE uses its own ratings system which does not readily translate to more familiar green building standards. In addition, the agency\u2019s 90 or so staffers are the only occupants of the six-storey, 32,000m space. Fewer than 2,000 people work on the campus, according to tour guides. Only 300 live on-site, all graduate students of the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, who are given free tuition and accommodation.  The pioneering autonomous transport system - which was originally supposed to stretch to 100 stations - was scrapped after the first two stops.    Related: Slump in oil prices drives green energy takeup in top exporting nations    There is a bike-sharing station \u2013 though it\u2019s a good 10 miles away from Abu Dhabi, and there are no bike paths.  And the rationale for Masdar City \u2013 demonstrating a model of green living \u2013 has been abandoned. \u201cThe original aim was to be net zero, yes, but that was when we were looking at the city in isolation,\u201d Wan said. He maintained it was important to look at Masdar City within the context of the other renewable energy holdings of the parent company. Among Mubadala\u2019s other holdings, Masdar Clean Energy is developing the Shams solar farm. \u201cMasdar as a family company is supply[ing] much, much more clean energy than what is being consumed in the city, for sure,\u201d Wan said. \u201cAll I am saying is that we are not going to use a city line boundary to try to dictate what is the most cost-effective way to produce clean energy, because the money invested in Masdar City and the money invested in Shams is the same source.\u201d He went on: \u201cIn the bigger picture I am doing more good for the country and for planet Earth because it\u2019s much more efficient.\u201d Long before the drop in oil prices, the UAE led the oil-producing Gulf countries in moving their economy away from fossil fuels. The country\u2019s leaders, staring at the prospect that their estimated reserves could run out in 50 years, invested in tourism, tech and renewable energy. Today about 70% of GDP comes from non-oil sectors, according to Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE prime minister. The country is eager to be seen as a leader in renewable energy and sustainability, convening regular leadership retreats to discuss their future beyond oil. In January the country\u2019s prime minister tweeted:    Celebrating the last barrel of oil, as my brother Mohammed bin Zayed has said, we will build a sustainable economy for future generations.&mdash; HH Sheikh Mohammed (@HHShkMohd) January 16, 2016    The UAE spent $20bn on a nuclear power plant, still under construction, projected to produce close to 25% of its electricity by 2020.

Well Aaron you\u2019re quite right, he really did. A keen darts man and pals with Phil \u2018The Power\u2019 Taylor\u2019 (\u201cI know Sam well and he\u2019s a decent player,\u201d Taylor once said) Allardyce was asked to take part in the early qualifying rounds of the 2003 UK Darts Open, when it was held at the Reebok Stadium. Alas, he wasn\u2019t invited because of his prowess on the oche, but rather that the BDO were after a little publicity from the then-Bolton manager.  Allardyce was \u2018drawn\u2019 against Peter Castle, a man from Southampton with a modest record who had nonetheless once reached the last 32 of the tournament, and he didn\u2019t seem to think it would be an inevitable cakewalk. \u201cIt will be a different kind of pressure and who knows what might happen?\u201d said Allardyce at the time. \u201cI was rather surprised when I was told I\u2019d drawn Sam Allardyce but I\u2019m really looking forward to playing him,\u201d Castle told the Manchester Evening News. \u201cI\u2019ll give him the same respect I give any player, especially as I\u2019d have a bit of a red face if he beat me ... He won\u2019t get any favours during the game and I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t expect any. But then I hope we\u2019ll have time for a pint and a laugh - and I\u2019ll tap him for two tickets for the Southampton game because they\u2019re so hard to get.\u201d     Sam Allardyce launches his campaign to qualify for the UK Darts Open. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images    Allardyce was the subject of a little light and, quite frankly, unnecessary \u2018banter\u2019 from the BBC before the big match, who reported at the time: \u2018Well he\u2019s certainly got the physique for it - you can bet your life those lips have seen a few pints disappearing between them over the years.\u2019 Uncalled for, Auntie.  Alas, victory for Sam was not to be. \u201cThey asked me to do a little bit of promotion and suggested I joined in the first round,\u201d Allardyce told FourFourTwo. \u201cLittle did I know that it was in a pub in south Manchester. I turned up on a Saturday morning and there were hundreds of people from all around the country. I got walloped by a lad from Southampton, if I remember rightly.\u201d He does remember rightly - walloped 5-0, specifically, but that didn\u2019t put him off introducing darts as a recreational activity later on, at both Newcastle and, as you can see here, West Ham.            LONG WAITS TO SCORE  \u201cI see that Barry Roche scored for the first time in 492 appearances for Morecambe against Portsmouth (with a header),\u201d writes Ben Dawson. \u201cWhat is the longest a player has waited?\u201d Over to you Huw Richards: \u201cWilfred Milne took 501 games between 1920 and 1934 to score for Swansea Town,\u201d writes Huw. \u201cHe finally broke through with a penalty then got six more, all but one a penalty, in the next couple of years. Still our record-holder for league appearances, purchased for the 2s 9d, which was the price of a fish supper.\u201d Huw goes on to point out that Steve Whitworth, a former England right-back who played for Leicester City, Sunderland, Bolton Wanderers and Mansfield Town also took more than 500 games to score [570 in fact - Knowledge Ed.] his first League goal, but that was spread over four clubs and Whitworth had previously scored one goal as a nipper for England U23s. THIS PLACE LOOKS AWFUL FAMILIAR II \u2026 \u201cHas a player ever played in two major tournaments that were held in the same country?\u201d asked Patrick Reilly. \u201cFor example, Mexico 1970 and 1986 or the World Cup in 1974 and Euro 88, which were both held in West Germany. Is there any player that played in France 98 in with a chance of playing at next year\u2019s Euros?\u201d The answer in last week\u2019s Knowledge was nothing if not thorough, but there was one notable omission when it came to answering the final part of Patrick\u2019s query. \u201cGianluigi Buffon was in Italy\u2019s squad for France 1998 and all going well will captain Italy in this year\u2019s European Championships,\u201d wrote David McNally. Interestingly - or not - despite Italy featuring in five matches during France 1998, Gigi will not be revisiting any of the stadia in which they played during Italy\u2019s group Euro 2016 group stage matches against Belgium, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland.  \u201cEric Gerets and Franky Van der Elst of Belgium played in Euro 1980 and the World Cup in 1990, both held in Italy,\u201d writes Laurence Hayes, while California\u2019s finest, Ron Cruz, spinning a world globe, pleads that we look slightly further afield in our quest for answers. \u201cAfrica is represented by Cameroon\u2019s Rigobert Song, who played at the 1996 African Cup of Nations and the 2010 World Cup, both held in South Africa,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cJapan\u2019s Masashi Nakayama played in the 1992 AFC Asian Cup that was hosted by his country and made his sole appearance at the co-hosted 2002 World Cup against Russia in Yokohama. But perhaps the most impressive feat that may never be equaled are the 2015 AFC Asian Cup winner\u2019s medals picked up by two Australians who were surviving members of the victorious Socceroos\u2019 squad that won the 2004 OFC Nations Cup, both held in Australia. Mark Bresciano and Tim Cahill are the only players in history to win continental international tournaments on two different continents.\u201d KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE  \u201cSeeing Luis Su\u00e1rez being offered use of John W Henry\u2019s private jet got me wondering: which footballers already own their own aircraft?\u201d asked Katherine Davis in November 2013. \u201cAre there many who hold pilots\u2019 licences? And do any own any particularly random modes of transport, such as tanks and the like?\u201d \u201cI give you ex-Celtic, Rosenberg and Norway marksman Harald Brattbakk,\u201d trumpets Paul Lang, sending us a link to this feature detailing Brattbakk\u2019s airborne second career. Having got his private pilot\u2019s licence not long before the end of his playing days, Harald got his commercial papers after retiring from football and now flies over the Lerkendal Stadium, home of Trondheim, almost every day. \u201cI was pretty much fed up with football and wanted to do something else with my life,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a pilot is much harder than being a footballer, though.\u201d \u201cIt is hard to get a tougher story than that belonging to Ron Dellow,\u201d Tim Dockery interjects, \u201cwho until earlier this month [when Ron died aged 99] was the oldest former player for Manchester City. Following his stint at City he played 104 games for Tranmere Rovers. The outbreak of the second world war interrupted Ron\u2019s transfer from Tranmere to Carlisle United, as he joined the RAF Ron served as a pilot of Lancaster Bombers, flying to Germany on 31 sorties and safely landing 29 times \u2013 on the other two occasions he wound up in the North Sea. After seven years in the armed services, Ron returned to civilian life and completed that transfer to Carlisle, playing one full season for them. He went to the Netherlands in 1948 to coach and stayed there for the next 65 years.\u201d As for our own search, the first name that sprang to mind was that of Marcus Hahnemann, the former Wolves goalkeeper. Unlike Michael Owen, who splashed out two million quid on a helicopter (more on that below), Hahnemann was basically being tight when he decided to become a qualified pilot. \u201cThe last two summers, we ended up going to Vancouver Island, where my buddy lives,\u201d he told the Guardian\u2019s very own Stuart James, in an interview in the spring of 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10-hour drive or a two-hour flight in a small plane, so we chartered a small plane. You pay $1,000 to get there. I thought that if I had my pilot\u2019s licence, I could rent the plane for $115 an hour.\u201d Back then Hahnemann wanted to finish his playing career back in Seattle before getting a part-time job flying Seattle-Vancouver; he recently confirmed that he\u2019ll be playing for Sounders again next season. But why wait until the end of your footballing career when you can combine visits to the physio with learning to fly a helicopter, eh? One of several things to rub Newcastle United supporters up the wrong way was the news, in 2006, that Michael Owen had bought a helicopter to trim his commute from north Wales to Newcastle. Word was that he had a pilot take him to and from until he got his own licence, but in an interview with the Evening Chronicle this summer Owen insisted that it was just a convenient way to get his family to matches. Owen did get his licence in the end, but apparently not in time to film this wonderful advert for Dubai without a green screen. \u201cIt may look a bit small from up here, but it is quite large.\u201d No wonder BT Sport signed him up. It also seems that Newcastle banned Owen from flying his helicopter during his time at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 the insurance premiums were high enough, thank you \u2013 but they didn\u2019t manage to stop Les Ferdinand, as our reader James Straughan reminded us. When Small Talk asked how the club felt about him getting his licence, Sir Les said with a chuckle: \u201cI may have sort of done it secretly.\u201d Last we heard, mind, he\u2019d sold his underused chopper and was looking to share one. \u201cI tend to just go for jolly-ups,\u201d he said back in 2007. \u201cYou know, fly around for an hour or two at 1,500 to 2,000 feet just to get away from it all.\u201d Perhaps Giulio Migliaccio might like to join him. After all, it\u2019s got to be a bit more relaxing than inadvertently driving a tank over cars daubed in the colours of your new club\u2019s rivals. For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive CAN YOU HELP  \u201cI noticed that Hearts are 11 points adrift of third place and 11 points clear of fifth place in the Scottish Premiership table today. What is the most isolated a team has ever been that was neither top or bottom of a league?\u201d asks Tony Locke. \u201cIn a not-entirely-friendly friendly in Malm\u00f6 this weekend between Malm\u00f6 FF and Br\u00f6ndby, the managers agreed at half-time that the teams would not change ends, so that the Malm\u00f6 goalkeeper, who used to to play for FC Copenhagen, did not have to stand just in front of the boisterous Danish fans. Has this ever happened before, and in a game which was not a friendly?\u201d ponders Philip Clover.  \u201cAs I type, the full time whistle has just blown at Villa Park where Liverpool have scored six goals, all by different players (Sturridge, Milner, Can, Origi, Clyne, and K Toure) which seems unusual to me. So, what is the most goals scored in a game by one side, all by different players?\u201d wonders Andrew Hill. \u201cNeil Warnock has just become boss of Rotherham United a mere 45 years after last playing for them. My question is thus: can anyone even approach this in term of length of hiatus between playing for and managing a club?\u201d asks Phil Rebbeck.

It was an open secret that Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays at the time, wanted the Scottish Open held at Turnberry as part of the bank\u2019s tournament sponsorship. Those at the Ayrshire venue \u2013 under Dubai ownership at the time, before Donald Trump bought it \u2013 stunned Diamond by firmly rejecting the notion. Barclays\u2019 deal didn\u2019t last much longer. Diamond had cause to be bemused. It was seen as too big a risk to the occasional staging of the Open Championship if a run-of-the-mill European Tour event was also on the premises. This was a strange scenario then and remains so now; for the infrequency that the Open is hosted by Turnberry, Troon and Carnoustie, it makes little sense whatsoever for the Scottish Open not to be played on these wonderful, tournament-ready links. In business terms, it is unfathomable. A glance at the records backs this up. The Open will return to Troon in July for the first time since 2004. Turnberry hasn\u2019t held the third major of the year since 2009. Carnoustie? 2007, when Padraig Harrington memorably upstaged Sergio Garc\u00eda. With the Scottish Open grasping desperately around in the dark for suitable locations, it defies all reasonable logic that these courses are excluded on some ridiculous fear of endangering the status of the Open. It is also incongruous; the Old Course plays a part in the Dunhill Links Championship every year without a St Andrews Open suffering any damage to its reputation. Martin Slumbers, who has succeeded Peter Dawson as the chief executive of the R&amp;A, should now make it clear for the wider benefit that Troon, Turnberry and Carnoustie can hold Scottish Opens without negative Open impact.   Related: Luke Donald heads to Scottish Open celebrating a year as world No1    For players, there would be obvious benefit. Last year\u2019s Irish Open at Royal County Down was a stunning success but also served as a reminder top professionals generally lack the competitive links skills they would have honed as amateurs. Simply, that is, through a shortage of exposure to traditional venues. This makes little sense, given links golf should form such a foundation to the sport. The Irish and Scottish Opens should automatically be hosted by the best links courses these countries have to offer. The intense scheduling demands of this golfing summer, linked largely to the sport\u2019s Olympic return, will lead to the 100th French Open and WGC-Bridgestone Invitational being played in the week immediately preceding the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart. The WGC event has to compete with the incentives offered by the European Tour for professionals to appear in France rather than the United States, meaning the world\u2019s top players face a tough choice. With the Open starting four days after the Scottish Open finishes, and a policy by so many leading golfers not to play three weeks in a row \u2013 especially around a major championship \u2013 Castle Stuart looks like the odd one out. However, Phil Mickelson and Henrik Stenson have already confirmed their participation but Rory McIlroy won\u2019t play and even the defending champion, Rickie Fowler, has been circumspect about his Scottish Open thoughts. Scepticism towards Castle Stuart, voiced in the past, is largely unfair. For all the venue could never be compared to Scotland\u2019s oldest links, it is a wonderfully designed and playable set-up in an area which has brilliantly embraced the tournament. Freakily, Scottish Opens played there haven\u2019t had the level of breeze \u2013 except for one day \u2013 that would make it a serious test. One staging of the event, which is on the outskirts of Inverness, was also disrupted by a storm which triggered landslides on the golf course. In 2016, they are due a bit of luck to match the stunning scenery which is broadcast to a television audience in the United States. Other venues have worked, such as Royal Aberdeen and Gullane, but there hasn\u2019t been much expression from the memberships at either for the Scottish Open to become a regular visitor. Dundonald Links is an upcoming stop but is not a patch on Scotland\u2019s premier, historic venues. Given they have reservations about the Open, it seems safe to assume the denizens of Muirfield wouldn\u2019t be enamoured about a European Tour stop. Elsewhere, though, there is obvious scope.

He gave it a quick glance, winked and whispered: \u201cIt is the president.\u201d \u201cYes sir, I tried to call you earlier, I have a problem and I need your help,\u201d he said, explaining that the Yemeni national airline had sold tickets for a flight from Dubai without obtaining landing permissions from the Saudi-led coalition. Since Yemeni militia backed by Saudi airstrikes retook the port city from Houthi rebels in July last year, Aden was officially back in government control but largely dependent on other countries for its security. Aden \u2013 pulverised by air strikes and tank shells \u2013 represents the Saudi-backed government\u2019s greatest success in Yemen\u2019s civil war, yet with a victorious coalition of separatist militia, jihadis, Salafists and loyalist army units unravelling, and few sources of employment for the civilian population, the city is fragile. The Yemeni state shows no sign of re-establishing itself despite the return of its president from exile. Aden\u2019s governor, General Jaafar Saad, sat upright, his grin fading into concern as the president spoke. \u201cYes sir, I understand, but if the passengers show up at the airport and there is no flight they will topple Aden over my head.\u201d    The Yemeni state shows no sign of re-establishing itself despite the return of its president    He picked up another phone and started calling officials in three countries: UAE army command in Abu Dhabi, Saudi airforce command in Riyadh and the airline director in Cairo. \u201cI want the airport to operate normally again. If I open the airport, I can bring NGOs, companies and investment into the city, get hotels running again and show the world that Aden is a safe place.\u201d Life was gradually coming back to Aden. A few cargo ships gingerly waited in the harbour, the markets were crowded and in the dusk hours the wet sands of the Arabian sea glittered with the reflections of women in black abayas and fathers in sarongs paddling with their children. Young men sat in their cars chewing khat, mesmerised by the orange sun sinking in the dark frothy waters. \u201cJust give me time and money and I will turn this city into the new miracle of the region,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have everything. We just need stability.\u201d     Fishermen in Aden. After months of war and siege the city is returning to life. Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    Obscuring the governor\u2019s dreams of a new Dubai lies a poor and wretched city, broken by decades of misrule, corruption and civil war. Airstrikes and tank shells have created corridors of devastation where floors lie flattened like crumpled biscuits, columns hang in mid-air and buildings miraculously stand on one corner. One thing does seem to be working well in Aden: electricity. The governor handed the power plants to the UAE Red Crescent, which provided massive generators. And some parts of the city function as they always have. Wooden dhows bring cattle from Somalia, passengers embark after a torturous 30-hour sea journey from Djibouti, and cargo ships empty cement on to the shore at what is now the country\u2019s only functioning port.  The war has also kept international fishing trawlers away from Yemeni waters, and the fishermen are enjoying the abundance. In the morning, long and narrow boats pull into the harbour, and fisherman toss giant hammerhead sharks, tuna and swordfish into the waves, where they float until young men swim out from the dock to collect them, their muscles tense and glistening. By noon, the small fish market on shore is packed with black crows nibbling on hundreds of butchered fish heads, shark fins and long red swordfish tongues.  But those crows also gather on the blackened rafters of British-era bungalows, while tanks and artillery pieces on which the wealth of a poor nation was squandered for decades sit rusting on hilltops. The streets, ports, police stations and other official buildings belong not to the president or governor, but the dozens of field commanders and the tens of thousands of \u201cresistance\u201d fighters who jostle for power and resources in neighbourhoods ruled by an array of military councils.  No one knows how many fighters roam the streets; 50,000, the governor said, maybe as many as 65,000. Many of them joined the resistance after the Houthi rebels left.     Militiamen have become the city\u2019s de facto rulers and administrators. Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    War is the city\u2019s best employer. Those who fought to recapture Aden wanted a reward, and those who hadn\u2019t see the resistance as the easiest way to earn a salary. Fighters are arriving daily from training camps in the countryside near Aden, some are trained in Saudi Arabia and others in Eritrea or Sudan. A founder of a powerful military council explained the rising numbers: \u201cYou can\u2019t compete in elections or create a party. To achieve political goals, you need a military power to force the others to listen to you.\u201d The field commander Ali is one of Aden\u2019s field commanders. A former manager of a mechanical workshop in Saudi Arabia, he was one of the first to pick up arms and fight when Houthi rebels and forces loyal to deposed former president Ali Abdulah Saleh invaded last March. \u201cIt was a spontaneous resistance first, we didn\u2019t have any clue on how to fight or attack, we went out in the morning, fired bullets at their bases and came back to sleep at our homes at night, we just wanted to fight.\u201d Flanked by a tight group of his men, Ali walked in an alleyway in the northern slums where the poor lived in concrete shacks that clung to the city without water or electricity. He pointed at destroyed buildings where snipers hid, a doorway where his friend was killed, a street corner where they buried their dead and the parched land where he was ambushed and injured. \u201cI lived the most beautiful days of my life in the war, we had no money and we scavenged for ammunition. Life was simple; you knew who was your enemy and who was your friend.     Pro-government fighters during the Independence Day military parade on 30 November 2015. Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    \u201cThe war brought everyone together, the southerners, the Salafis and even the jihadis. We were in contact with people we would have never dreamt of being with before. We met al-Qaida and we fought together, we helped them and they helped us because we had one common enemy.\u201d It was after the war, he says, that came the mercenaries, profiteers and the resistance.  The fighting had stopped in August, and yet there were no police and no state, he said. In the vacuum, Ali had become a judge, police chief, tribal leader and de facto military ruler of the slum. In his base, a ramshackle police station, people gathered around him asking him to solve marital problems, release prisoners, denounce \u201cnorthern agents\u201d or just shake his hands. He had fired the former police chief. A few old investigating officers, now working under his command, sat on a long metal bench and wrote witness statements.    Everyone is holding an institution or a building as a hostage, and won\u2019t leave it until he is given a tank  Former army officer     He listened patiently to cases but as lunchtime approached Ali had to find money to feed his men. He usually called on businessmen, borrowed from friends or pestered generals for the money. He pointed at the yard where two dozen of his men sat in the shade of a large tree: tribesmen, a couple of former special forces trained by the Americans and an old hardened leftist who had been at a Cuban militia school in the 1970s, and mostly poor slum dwellers who found themselves in the middle of war. \u201cDuring the war we were 85 fighters, now we are more than 900,\u201d Ali says. The last time any of his men were paid was four months ago, when they got 200 Saudi riyals (\u00a338) each. Since then Ali has been paying them 1,000 Yemeni riyals (\u00a33) for their lunch and hoping this month salaries will be paid.  \u201cThe jihadis are luring them with better money, while the coalition just promise us salaries from one month to the next. We don\u2019t want the coalition to build another airport, but to take care of these men. If they don\u2019t get salaries and don\u2019t get jobs we will be a new Libya,\u201d he said.     An estimated 50,000-65,000 militiamen patrol the streets. Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    A wealthy businessman came to Ali\u2019s aid with some money to feed his men. Group leaders distributed the cash, and another day passed. \u201cI am tired, I sleep for three hours only, my children are not going to school. I wonder if I should leave this and go back to my work,\u201d one fighter said, his eyes strained with exhaustion. \u201cWe fought hard for this, but it has been months since we liberated the city and still there is no state.\u201d In the evening Ali attended a meeting with other commanders in an attempt to bring the city\u2019s two largest military councils together. He sat in corner writing a Facebook post on his phone as the men around him traded accusations.    Many fighters joined the resistance because it is the only available job  Late Aden governor Jaafar Saad     \u201cEveryone is holding an institution or a building as a hostage, and won\u2019t leave it until he is given a tank or armoured vehicles,\u201d said a former army officer.

Aden was in a state of dichotomy. On one hand it was the temporary capital of Yemen, ruled ostensibly by Hadi and his government, whose return to power had been the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the war and the Saudi intervention. Yet Hadi rarely left his heavily guarded presidential compound perched high on top of a hill, while in the streets below most of the people saw the war as a war of liberation from northern rule from Sana\u2019a, and Aden as the capital of an independent southern state.  The flag of South Yemen, which unified with the north in 1990, then lost to it in a 1994 civil war, fluttered over schools and government institutions and were painted on walls and shop fronts. \u201cSince liberating Aden, neither Hadi nor the coalition have been able to build a state and they are not letting us build a one,\u201d said a member of the Southern Resistance council. \u201cThe coalition says all support comes through the legitimate government, I tell them fine but they are a name without a state. If there was a state we wouldn\u2019t need the resistance to go solve problems and secure the street.\u201d The frontline stood along the dark and arid volcanic mountains, straddling the old north-south borders that once separated the two Yemeni states. In the shade of one armoured vehicle, parked on the last bend of the road before the Houthi positions and piled high with bedding, plastic bags and sacks of food, sat a thin old commander, with a white moustache and few days\u2019 stubble. His men \u2013 a unit of Yemeni fighters \u2013 said he had once been a colonel in the South Yemen army. \u201cYou see that mountain?\u201d He pointed at a distant ridge from where a sniper fired a occasional bullet that cracked overhead. \u201cBeyond that it\u2019s another country, like any other Arab country ... Lebanon, or Syria or Egypt. Over there, that\u2019s not our war. We are here to defend if they want to come and attack us.\u201d      Militiamen in Aden. Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    A few metres ahead stood another group of fighters, jihadis affiliated with al-Qaida. They saw no borders separating them from the Houthis and they despised the southerners. \u201cThree days ago we advanced and took all these positions, and then we went to rest yesterday night and this morning they attacked and took the ridge,\u201d shouted their commander, a young man with one leg shorter than the other. One of his men taunted the southerners. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put a barrel there and stand behind it and see if the Houthis will respect the border?\u201d (The borders were previously marked by barrels.) \u201cHow dare you talk like this,\u201d shouted an old fighter. \u201cI have lost two brothers in this war, I swear by the great honour of the southern revolution.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s blasphemy \u2013 you should only swear by God,\u201d said the jihadi. Guns were cocked. \u201cThis is why we are losing the war: because you are bunch of infidels.\u201d The militia and jihadis faced off until others intervened. The southerners withdrew their tanks and armoured vehicles, leaving the jihadis at the frontline. Funeral  The governor dismissed tensions between the militia and the jihadis with his confident reassuring smile, but his eyes were weary. The militia were a problem of employment, he said. \u201cMany of the fighters joined the resistance because being in the resistance is the only available job. I need to provide services, bring employment and gradually I will take the youth out of the militias.\u201d   Related: Where are the world's most war-damaged cities?    The jihadis were a different problem and he needed time to deal with them. \u201cI meet with them, I even fulfill some of their requests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long game. I need to build my security apparatus before I tackle them. It\u2019s a game of patience and the longer it takes the more benefit I get.\u201d On Monday morning, the governor left his house according to his well-planned schedule and drove along the Gold Mohur beach before driving up a hill overlooking blue waters. The sky was blue and crisp and Aden\u2019s volcanic hills sat majestically over the water.  Parked along the road was a white van with tinted windows. It exploded in a huge orange ball next to the governor\u2019s convoy, turning his armoured car into mangled black wreckage. The next day a large crowd walked in the governor\u2019s funeral procession, following his coffin into the cemetery. Ali stood under the shade of tree while his men nervously scanned the crowd for signs of danger. \u201cIf we don\u2019t build a state, they will kill us all.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "title": "The city where war is the best employer: life in liberated Aden", "sentences": ["He gave it a quick glance, winked and whispered: \u201cIt is the president.\u201d \u201cYes sir, I tried to call you earlier, I have a problem and I need your help,\u201d he said, explaining that the Yemeni national airline had sold tickets for a flight from Dubai without obtaining landing permissions from the Saudi-led coalition.", "Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    Obscuring the governor\u2019s dreams of a new Dubai lies a poor and wretched city, broken by decades of misrule, corruption and civil war."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-18T14:06:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/18/wta-tour-tennis-injuries", "tags": ["Tennis", "Serena Williams", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "As the 2016 WTA Tour season dawned at the start of the year, Serena Williams pulled out of the Hopman Cup exhibition with a knee issue. Simona Halep was carrying an ankle injury. Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza struggled with plantar fasciitis in her left foot, Maria Sharapova with her left forearm. Petra Kvitova had a stomach virus and pulled out of both her tune-up events.   Related: Tennis gambling: 73 matches reported over suspicious activity in 2015    Agnieszka Radwanska \u2013 the in-form player after winning the WTA Tour Finals in Singapore to end the 2015 season \u2013 won a small tournament, then pulled out of her next with a leg injury. Lucie Safarova, the 2015 French Open finalist, was still recovering from a bacterial inflection that struck her in the fall and missed the entire Australian swing. She still hasn\u2019t played. These are the top women tennis players on the planet. And nearly all of them are hurt, struggling, or simply not playing. At the Australian Open at the end of January, Williams turned out to be fine, although an attack of nerves and a relentless opponent in Angelique Kerber cost her the title. But she hasn\u2019t played since. Others faltered early: Halep (the No2 seed) in the first round, Kvitova in the second, Muguruza in the third. The intervening weeks only appear to back up those early concerns. And somehow, it appears to be more than the usual collection of aches and pains: some of the injuries that are keeping the tour\u2019s best players off the court are often the very same injuries that compromised the end of their 2015 campaigns. And that\u2019s alarming. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to compete,\u201d Muguruza said to a small gathering of reporters in Dubai late Tuesday night after a painful-looking 7-6, 6-3 loss to Elina Svitolina. \u201cI need to start from scratch.\u201d The 22-year-old spoke of playing with a lot of pressure, of everyone expecting her to win every match she plays, of possibly taking a break from tournaments until she feels 100% ready. Coming into Dubai, Muguruza had played exactly two tournaments (four total matches) and one Fed Cup weekend in 2016. The Dubai tournament offers more than $1.7m in prize money \u2013 and all the duty-free goods you can stuff into your suitcase. Yet from the original entry list, six players ranked in the top 17 withdrew before they even began. All eight remaining seeds lost their first match of the tournament. Kvitova won the first set 6-0 against American Madison Brengle before succumbing Wednesday night. Trying unsuccessfully to hold back tears during changes of ends, Muguruza made 40 unforced errors in the first set alone against Svitolina. Defending champion Halep had originally decided not to play as she scheduled a two-month break to have surgery on a deviated septum. Suddenly, after playing Fed Cup, she pronounced herself fit, healthy and confident and all thoughts of a break were swept aside. So much for that. There are as many reasons as there are players for this breakdown atop the women\u2019s game. There\u2019s pressure to meet the criteria for the WTA Tour year-end bonus-pool money, which is considerable. There is the huge spotlight on players like Halep and Muguruza, who went from underdogs to major favourites in the blink of an eye. For Kvitova, nearly 26 and seemingly old enough to be past this point, there have been health issues and a major coaching change.     Kvitova, 26, has struggled with injuries and a change of coach. Photograph: Aaron Favila/AP    What to make of players coming back from an off-season that is supposed to refresh only to appear hobbled, and burned out, before the first two months of the season are even in the books? \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss out too much. We don\u2019t want to lose our rankings. We want to compete at our favourite events. We just want to come back, and sometimes it\u2019s really too soon,\u201d said Jelena Jankovic, who had her own injury issues in 2015.  In many cases, the off-season can be the culprit, at least according to some coaches and trainers the Guardian spoke to during the Australian Open. \u201cThey probably overdo it a little bit. And also when you take breaks, injuries happen. Your body starts to go into a rest mode and then when you get back into it with intensity, often you see people get injured right after the preseason or during the pre-season,\u201d said Yves Boulais, who has worked with former top-40 player Rebecca Marino, Eugenie Bouchard and currently coaches American Alison Riske. \u201cIt\u2019s overload. In December, they still haven\u2019t recovered from the year before and now they\u2019re doing more than normal. The strength coach wants to get his stuff in. The tennis coach wants to get his stuff in. They also test new equipment, strings, racquets, all these things, and sometimes that\u2019s part of the issue,\u201d said fitness coach Allistair McCaw, who currently works with top ATP Tour player Kevin Anderson but whose client list has included Dinara Safina, Svetlana Kuznetsova and many others. \u201c[The off-season] is the only time for the trainer to maximize, so they put on heavier weights. They\u2019re doing squats now, stuff they wouldn\u2019t do in season. Then they go hit balls in the afternoon. But then there\u2019s a breakdown of the muscle tissue from the strength work that hasn\u2019t recovered yet. The body\u2019s not used to that. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted the players I worked with in December to come to Australia 80% fit, not 100%, because there are still three weeks before the [Australian] Open,\u201d McCaw added. \u201cThe players come to Australia tired and exhausted already because they\u2019ve been going since mid-November.\u201d Another issue is the way the women treat their practice time. Boulais, who has been on the scene a long time \u2013 he coached wife Patricia Hy-Boulais in the mid-90s \u2013 said the women tend to go as far as they pushed, and beyond. \u201cThe guys might be a bit more aware of their limits and when they reach them, they will express themselves a little more,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the women, it\u2019s a very difficult mental process. They try to win every point, and if they don\u2019t, there\u2019s something wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s usually more difficult to play well and when you play under pressure all the time, you break down,\u201d he added. \u201cA big part of coaching is knowing what your players can do. It\u2019s very easy to injure players; obviously the competition is strong, so everyone wants to be at their limit where they want to get the most out of themselves.\u201d McCaw agreed although he points to current client Anderson as being equally relentless. \u201cPhysically they\u2019re not as strong as the guys. That\u2019 s normal. But they\u2019re doing probably more. With the guys, it\u2019s an hour of rhythm; with the women it\u2019s drill, drill, drill all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey lose points in a match and they\u2019re taken to the next court to get fed more balls. And they\u2019re hard on themselves.\u201d McCaw said players often will pay for a top-quality coach, then try to skimp on a fitness trainer. \u201cYou can\u2019t get quality people if you\u2019re paying peanuts. And that\u2019s part of the problem as well,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the things I\u2019ve seen players do with trainers at tournaments, I\u2019m like: \u2018What are you doing? Why?\u2019\u201d Jankovic, considered one of the more durable players on tour, has had her own experiences with having the wrong people around her; she ended up being injured all the time. She said the current malaise on the women\u2019s tour could be a combination of many factors.     Maria Sharapova is not expected to play until mid-March. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/EPA    \u201cSometimes it can be bad training, wrong training. Sometimes it can be too much playing, not knowing when to stop. If you\u2019re successful, and going deep into tournaments, it takes a toll on your body,\u2019 she said. \u201cI think the most important thing over the years that I have learned is to listen to your body. When you\u2019re tired, when you think you can\u2019t go any more, just stop.\u201d That\u2019s easier said than done. There is so much money to be made, so many opportunities for the top players in the women\u2019s game. There are increasing numbers of people around them \u2013 the ubiquitous \u201cteams\u201d \u2013 who depend on them to make their living. The motivation to keep them on court isn\u2019t always altruistic. After all, it\u2019s business. More will be revealed next week when the WTA tour stop in Doha offers even more prize money and even more ranking points. Williams has already withdrawn, as has Sharapova. But as of Wednesday night nearly all of the remaining top 20 are still entered \u2013 including those who withdrew this week in Dubai, and all those who lost early. \u201cEven though I think we are smart people, we are not smart when we are making those decisions,\u201d Jankovic said. \u201cOur will to be out there is stronger than that thought in the back of our heads, that common sense.

That famous evening in Paris at the Stade Jean-Bouin has been placed to one side and, instead, an Olympic medal in sevens is the ambition. A change, then, from the traditional 15-a-side emphasis but an understandable one. With sevens making its Olympic bow in Rio this year, the opportunity to secure some precious metal has been seized enthusiastically. After the World Cup win 16 months ago 20 England players were offered professional contracts with the understanding they would focus on sevens, eventually under the banner of Great Britain, and they rate their chances of success highly. Simon Middleton\u2019s squad are in Brazil for a Women\u2019s Sevens Series event this weekend. The tournament, this leg held in S\u00e3o Paulo, has been dominated by New Zealand in recent years, while Australia are also considered frontrunners for an Olympic gold in August and won the last series in Dubai. However, for England, significant progress has been made. In December they finished third in Dubai and, according to the scrum-half Natasha Hunt, the desire to win a medal at the Olympics is keenly felt throughout the squad. \u201cAs soon as it became an Olympic sport, the dream changed,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cAnyone who has the opportunity to go to an Olympic Games would bite your hands off for that chance. That was definitely the case for me. It would be phenomenal [to get a medal], words wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very experienced team. It\u2019s no secret that we are one of the oldest teams on the circuit and we\u2019ve got girls that have been around a while with a wealth of experience. We\u2019re not the quickest, we never have been, but we\u2019re good rugby players. We try and break the game down and pick people off before giving it to our strong ball carriers to break the line. \u201cIn Dubai we had lots of individual performances but not a team performance. Our power athletes got us over the line there but this weekend it\u2019s all about performing as a team. We are trying to be dominant in the contact area and make sure we keep the ball more.\u201d While the sevens squad is in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 delaying their departure from last Saturday to Tuesday to reduce time in Brazil because of the Zika virus \u2013\u00a0England\u2019s Six Nations team have started their campaign well, with victories over Scotland and Italy. The concern remains that reintegrating members of the sevens squad into the 15s set-up after Rio in preparation for the 2017 World Cup may be tricky, but Middleton believes the chance to compete in an Olympics and promote the women\u2019s game on a grand stage was a crucial one to take. The England coach said: \u201cWe looked at the squad after 2014 and thought what do we need to defend the World Cup in 2017, but then the focus immediately shifted to the sevens and qualification for Rio, which is why we contracted 20 players we thought would best achieve that. That left a massive hole in the 15s environment and we also lost players to retirement. But our squad gets on really well, we sat down with players and everyone accepted that to elevate the women\u2019s game we had to play on the biggest stage. \u201cBeing successful in the Olympics was pivotal to that. I think to just focus on the 15s would have been grossly incompetent, it was never an option. \u201cAt this moment Australia are playing at a different level to everyone else. Then New Zealand have got brilliant players and Canada are fantastic athletes. It\u2019s going to be an unbelievable competition. Then come September there will be 20 world class \u200bEngland \u200bplayers rejoining the 15s programme and the emphasis will shift completely to retaining the World Cup.\u201d England held discussions with the unions of Scotland and Wales about players they wanted to be considered in the sevens squad, which will eventually represent Britain in August. Wales put forward the centre Laurie Harries and wing Jasmine Joyce, while Scotland have Stephanie Johnson representing them in the squad and non-playing staff \u200bof both nations were also encouraged to apply for positions in the backroom team.

But within the next few months he will pack up his robes and pen and move to London, as it is the only option he has found to secure a better-paying job that would allow his American wife Erica Viola to join him in the UK. \u201cThe bard of Glastonbury is leaving Glastonbury because of these rules,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many other people with roles at the heart of their local communities have been uprooted because of them?  \u201cEven if I was full-time, it would be shy of the income threshold. I do think it\u2019s amazing that you can have a role which is paid for by local government and it\u2019s still not enough for you to be with your own family.\u201d He met Viola on a band forum online 16 years ago, and later in person at a Manic Street Preachers concert in the UK in 2002. The relationship was a slow burner, but they spontaneously agreed to chat on Skype in 2011 and that was the clincher. \u201cIt seemed more real, it wasn\u2019t going on in each other\u2019s head,\u201d White said. It was the same lightning bolt for Viola: \u201cSeeing him again after all those years made everything really intense and I knew that obviously it was going to be tough, but I wanted to be with him and no one else, no matter how many visas or oceans it took.\u201d  The pair got engaged in 2012, but a week later, the rule on minimum income came into force. White said they initially thought they could overcome the difficulties of the threshold, but he struggled to find a better paid job in Glastonbury.     I do feel as though I\u2019m being punished, and Wes in particular is being punished because he couldn\u2019t find an English wife  Erica Viola     They were married in May 2013, in a vineyard in Viola\u2019s native Nebraska. A couple\u2019s marital status does not have an effect on the income threshold rules but marriage was something they wanted anyway, Viola said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already waited 11 years, even if you are going to be 5,000 miles away I still wanted to be your wife.\u2019\u201d Moving to the US would have its own difficulties, but both say they would prefer to be in the UK. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s partly become a point of principle, I should be able to live in my own country with my own wife,\u201d White said. \u201cIf they can encourage British people to leave the country, it\u2019s minus one on the migration target. To feel like your marriage is part of that statistic feels very dehumanising.\u201d Like many couples in his situation, White said friends and family found it extremely difficult to understand. \u201cPeople look at you like you\u2019re mad, it\u2019s an alienating experience. My grandma thinks I should just be able to write Erica\u2019s name in my passport and she\u2019ll be here next week.\u201d \u201cI do feel as though I\u2019m being punished,\u201d Viola said, \u201cand Wes in particular is being punished because he couldn\u2019t find an English wife!\u201d With White\u2019s new job in the capital, Viola hopes to come to the UK as early as the summer. He hopes to still pursue his poetry, and has even written one about Theresa May. \u201cThere\u2019s already a bard in the London borough I\u2019m moving to so we\u2019ll have to see what happens with that!\u201d     Precious Depasse with her son Marley.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    \u2018Every time the phone rings, he thinks it\u2019s his dad \u2013 he thinks he lives in the computer\u2019 Precious Depasse, a student at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London, was studying Swahili in her year abroad in Zanzibar when she fell in love with Tanzanian Max el-Amry after a night playing pool in a bar with friends. The couple now have a son, Marley, but Amry has never been granted permission to come to the UK to visit his 18-month-old son, with their only contact being on holidays to Dubai.  \u201cWhat\u2019s so frustrating is that I\u2019m young and I haven\u2019t had a chance to start our life together, everything is on hold,\u201d Depasse said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m treated like this by my own country.\u201d   Related: Draft EU rules could tighten migration loophole for foreign-born spouses    Depasse wanted to give birth near her family in Solihull, West Midlands, and they initially planned to have Amry, a hotel manager, come to the UK on a visitor\u2019s visa so he could be by his girlfriend\u2019s side. \u201cIt was denied twice, they believed he would not return home, despite having a job to return to.  \u201cWe found out afterwards that it\u2019s very rare to get a visitor\u2019s visa if you have a partner and child here, they just don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll leave. I gave up on the hope that he would witness his son being born and I gave birth without him.\u201d Four months later, she brought Marley to meet his dad in Dubai, and the couple have met abroad whenever they can afford to. \u201cMy son has only spent a total of four weeks with his father and he\u2019s almost 18 months old,\u201d she said. \u201c[When we\u2019re there] it\u2019s more like a holiday, it\u2019s not real life. We\u2019re in a hotel, going out to eat. I want a normal life, doing normal things together.\u201d The rules on minimum income came in shortly after the couple had decided to apply for a spousal visa. Depasse is still studying and has a place on the Teach First programme for September, but fears it may not pay enough to meet the minimum. \u201cI\u2019ll have to earn the wage for six months, Marley will be nearly four by then,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time the phone rings, he thinks it\u2019s his dad \u2013 he thinks he lives in the computer. Depasse said she is reluctant to leave the UK because of the close relationship she has with her family and the help they give her. \u201cHe\u2019s in a very different situation, his dad has remarried, his mum lives abroad and he\u2019s pretty much by himself. It makes sense to come here,\u201d she said.  \u201cThe income rules are a very simplistic way to solve what is quite a small problem of people abusing the rules,\u201d she said. \u201cSome days you feel so angry, other times it\u2019s just really upsetting. I didn\u2019t really have a clue about the rules, you hear so much about immigration and how easy it is for everyone to get into the country and it isn\u2019t true at all, I never thought how big a problem it would be.\u201d     Kelly McDermott and her daughter Sophia with a picture of Kelly\u2019s partner, Christos Uta Pailodze. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    \u2018We feel like we\u2019re being kicked out of our own country, because her dad\u2019s not welcome here\u2019 Even though Kelly McDermott\u2019s partner, Christos Uta Pailodze, is more than 2,600 miles away in Georgia in eastern Europe, he is always in their east London living room. When McDermott is home with the couple\u2019s four-year-old daughter, Sophia, they turn on the computer, place it on the sofa, and Pailodze is waiting on Skype.  \u201cA lot of couples in the UK they don\u2019t see each other or talk to each other as much as we do,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cWe try to bond with Sophia as much as possible, so they\u2019ll play Pictionary on Skype, they make up games to play.\u201d She met Pailodze while working a summer bar job each year on the Greek island of Kos. They met three years before they started dating in 2010. A year later, she fell pregnant with Sophia and the couple decided to start a life in Britain.     I can\u2019t help with what the baby wants, with anything. I can\u2019t describe how that feels  Christos Uta Pailodze     \u201cThat\u2019s when everything sort of went downhill, really,\u201d she said. An application for a visitor\u2019s visa for Pailodze to be there at his daughter\u2019s birth was declined, and the new thresholds for income came in a month after Sophia was born. \u201cFriends say \u2018why don\u2019t you just get married?\u2019, and that\u2019s the point \u2013 it doesn\u2019t solve anything,\u201d she said.  McDermott now works part-time as a retail assistant, but says even on a full-time wage she would not earn enough. She is a single parent, dependent on housing benefit, when she would prefer not to have to rely on the taxpayer. \u201cYou hear the phrase \u2018burden on the taxpayer\u2019 [in relation to spousal visas], and in our current situation, to all intents and purposes that\u2019s what we are because I\u2019m a single parent, I can only work part-time,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he was here, we wouldn\u2019t have access to public funds anyway, because you\u2019re not allowed to, but also we would both work and contribute like all other British families, we\u2019d share the childcare.\u201d Pailodze says he feels frustrated he cannot help his partner earn a living or share the childcare. \u201cI felt guilty she was alone, like every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t help with what the baby wants, with anything. I can\u2019t describe how that feels.\u201d McDermott and Sophia travel to Georgia or Turkey twice a year to meet Pailodze, which costs the large chunks of what the couple can afford to save. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know how I do it, we have to live so tightly, to afford to go and see her dad.\u201d With no prospect of their circumstances changing, the couple have decided their only way of being together is for McDermott to leave England, and they plan to move back to Kos in the spring, where they first met. \u201cThat is what we\u2019re going to have to do, up and leave everything Sophia\u2019s ever known,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re being kicked out really, because her dad\u2019s not welcome here. It\u2019s terrifying, it\u2019s not sunk in yet, but if this is the only way we\u2019ve got, we have to do it.\u201d", "title": "'I should be able to live with my wife': families divided by UK visa rules", "sentences": ["The couple now have a son, Marley, but Amry has never been granted permission to come to the UK to visit his 18-month-old son, with their only contact being on holidays to Dubai.", "I gave up on the hope that he would witness his son being born and I gave birth without him.\u201d Four months later, she brought Marley to meet his dad in Dubai, and the couple have met abroad whenever they can afford to."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-21T16:17:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/21/everton-roberto-martinez-fa-cup-bournemouth", "tags": ["Everton", "Roberto Mart\u00ednez", "Bournemouth", "FA Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "There are times when Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s optimism stretches credulity and patience but Everton are showing a sign or two of justifying his faith. A side better known for thrills and spills have eked out a path to the FA Cup sixth round in workmanlike fashion and this ultimately comfortable win extended a record that has passed with little comment. Everton have lost once in their past 11 away games, that setback arising inconveniently at the controversial Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Manchester City, and it may not be overly generous to suggest that, away from a tetchy Goodison Park, they are honing a durability their manager believes will redeem them.   Related: Romelu Lukaku deals Bournemouth knockout blow sending Everton onward    One of the problems under Mart\u00ednez has been that everything tends to feel like a learning curve, a process extended indefinitely to an elusive end. Their attacking style has come easily but the accompanying knocks have been hard. Mart\u00ednez said he would rather his team reach a Wembley semi-final by toughing out their poor home form, which has included recent defeats to Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion, than build on an away formula that appears to be working smoothly. A resurgent Chelsea look like a hindrance but should provide the quarter-final examination he craves. \u201cOur away form has been very good,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThat is the challenge now \u2013 we want to match the results we are getting away from home. I just feel that, if we are going to be successful, we need to turn those home results into good results. \u201cThe League Cup campaign we had was not an accident. We got very close to the final and were very unfortunate in the second leg. The team is slowly learning the lessons, learning how to control big moments and play in cup competitions.\u201d A return home does not seem the easy option on this evidence but Everton rarely take that route. They enjoyed good fortune at the Vitality Stadium, Joel Robles\u2019s save from a Charlie Daniels penalty before half-time \u2013 not to mention Simon Francis\u2019s miss from the follow-up \u2013 sparing them a second period that could have had desperate consequences for their season. Ross Barkley scored a deflected 20-yarder, just as he had at Carlisle United in the previous round, and Romelu Lukaku\u2019s piece of opportunism came from a corner routine that may or may not have been planned. Generally, though, there was a balance to Everton that kept a willing but weakened Bournemouth at arm\u2019s length. James McCarthy took that rather too literally when handling for Daniels\u2019s penalty, running the risk of a second yellow card in so doing, but Mart\u00ednez believes the midfielder\u2019s return \u2013 he played only once between 28 November and 27 January \u2013 has been fundamental to their improvement. \u201cJames was booked early on but I know he and Gareth Barry can cope easily with that kind of situation because of the experience they have,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThey give a totally different balance and look to the side and that has been very important in the last five games. The team looks very solid now and we have missed James when he has been out.\u201d Everton have conceded once in those five fixtures and Robles has been a common factor too \u2013 it is a curiosity John Stones, back on the bench here after injury, has missed them all. Mart\u00ednez went out of his way to praise Robles, as well as the goalkeeper he has displaced, after his press conference. \u201cJoel was in a transitional period, mentally and as a goalkeeper, when he arrived at the club,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been working very hard away from the starting lineups, and he looks ready now. That\u2019s down to Tim Howard\u2019s influence as well. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get a better teacher on how to be a goalkeeper for Everton. What Tim has done to make Joel feel comfortable in our goal has been very important, and Joel\u2019s growth behind the scenes is down to the environment he has created. I will always be very grateful and every fan should know what Tim has been doing.\u201d It does not take special skills in nuance to note the valedictory tone in Mart\u00ednez\u2019s recent pronouncements about Howard, who turns 37 next month. You wonder whether a Wembley swan song would be out of the question; you also wonder whether Everton, who will spend this week in Dubai in preparation for a 12-game salvage operation on their Premier League campaign, may finally be placed to make use of the luck that gets teams that far.

Related: 'I should be able to live with my wife': families divided by UK visa rules    British citizens must earn more than \u00a318,600 to bring over a non-EU spouse, rising to \u00a322,400 if they have a child who does not have British citizenship, and an additional \u00a32,400 for each subsequent child. Critics argue that the law, introduced in July 2012, penalises 43% of the UK population and means British citizens in full-time employment on the minimum wage cannot enjoy the right to live with their families in the UK. The supreme court challenge, brought after the case was dismissed by the court of appeal last year, has three appellants: two of them, Abdul Majid and Shabana Javed, are British and both married to Pakistani nationals; and the third is known as MM, a Lebanese refugee.  Before the court of appeal dismissal, Mr Justice Blake had ruled at the high court that the financial requirements were \u201ca disproportionate interference with a genuine spousal relationship\u201d and suggested a minimum income closer to the minimum wage would be more appropriate.   Related: Draft EU rules could tighten migration loophole for foreign-born spouses    In September, research by Middlesex University and the charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants found about 15,000 British children are either separated from one parent or forced to grow up outside the UK because of the rules. In response to the the study, Longfield said: \u201cWe are not talking about having unrestricted access but we need to put the heart back into this policy and consider the profound impact the rules have on this group of British children and their families.\u201d Last year, the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue called on the government to change the rules, noting the \u201csignificant contribution millions of low-paid Britons make to our economy and society, as well as the value of having families living together in the same country\u201d. It recommended family visas also be granted as long as the British partner had paid income tax for the past two-and-a-half years. The Home Office said it was determined \u201cfamily life must not be established here at the taxpayer\u2019s expense.The level of the minimum income threshold reflects the income at which a British family generally ceases to be able to access income-related benefits.\u201d Sonel Mehta, the founder of the campaign BritCits, which gives support to divided families, said the government was keen to crack down further on family reunification because it was one area where policy was having a real effect on keeping immigration numbers down. \u201cFamilies are an easy target, they aren\u2019t big business or universities that can do big lobbying to get in students or workers from abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t replace your husband or wife with a British substitute if the visa is denied.\u201d More than 40 people from BritCits plan to attend the supreme court hearings this week, many of them who have sons and daughters forced to live abroad or have non-EU spouses cut off from their children. A ruling is not expected for a number of months. Don Flynn, director of Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, said he hoped at the very least that the supreme court would acknowledge that there should be more flexibility for individual cases. \u201cIn any case I have ever been involved with, the Home Office has not once exercised any discretion. You have to earn over that amount or it will be refused. I would hope the supreme court will acknowledge that, perhaps draw up some guidelines for when that discretion should be exercised in order to make sure the right to a family life is protected,\u201d he said. \u2018The bard of Glastonbury is leaving Glastonbury - how many other people at the heart of their local communities have been uprooted?\u2019     Wes White the Bard of Glastonbury who has an American wife Erica Viloa, pictured on Glastonbury Tor. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Guardian    Poet Wes White is the 10th bard of Glastonbury, an honorary position in the Somerset town where he has lived for most of his life, and where he also works part-time in the local library. But within the next few months he will pack up his robes and pen and move to London, as it is the only option he has found to secure a better-paying job that would allow his American wife Erica Viola to join him in the UK. \u201cThe bard of Glastonbury is leaving Glastonbury because of these rules,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many other people with roles at the heart of their local communities have been uprooted because of them? \u201cEven if I was full-time, it would be shy of the income threshold. I do think it\u2019s amazing that you can have a role which is paid for by local government and it\u2019s still not enough for you to be with your own family.\u201d He met Viola on a band forum online 16 years ago, and later in person at a Manic Street Preachers concert in the UK in 2002. The relationship was a slow burner, but they spontaneously agreed to chat on Skype in 2011 and that was the clincher. \u201cIt seemed more real, it wasn\u2019t going on in each other\u2019s head,\u201d White said. It was the same lightning bolt for Viola: \u201cSeeing him again after all those years made everything really intense and I knew that obviously it was going to be tough, but I wanted to be with him and no one else, no matter how many visas or oceans it took.\u201d  The pair got engaged in 2012, but a week later, the rule on minimum income came into force. White said they initially thought they could overcome the difficulties of the threshold, but he struggled to find a better paid job in Glastonbury. They were married in May 2013, in a vineyard in Viola\u2019s native Nebraska. A couple\u2019s marital status does not have an effect on the income threshold rules but marriage was something they wanted anyway, Viola said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already waited 11 years, even if you are going to be 5,000 miles away I still wanted to be your wife.\u2019\u201d Like many couples in his situation, White said friends and family found it extremely difficult to understand. \u201cPeople look at you like you\u2019re mad, it\u2019s an alienating experience. My grandma thinks I should just be able to write Erica\u2019s name in my passport and she\u2019ll be here next week.\u201d \u201cI do feel as though I\u2019m being punished,\u201d Viola said, \u201cand Wes in particular is being punished because he couldn\u2019t find an English wife!\u201d  \u2018Every time the phone rings, he thinks it\u2019s his dad \u2013 he thinks he lives in the computer\u2019     Precious Depasse at home in Solihull with her son Marley, whose Tanzania based partner, Max, cannot get a visa to live in the UK Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Precious Depasse, a student at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London, was studying Swahili in her year abroad in Zanzibar when she fell in love with Tanzanian Max el-Amry after a night playing pool in a bar with friends. The couple now have a son, Marley, but Amry has never been granted permission to come to the UK to visit his 18-month-old son, with their only contact being on holidays to Dubai. \u201cWhat\u2019s so frustrating is that I\u2019m young and I haven\u2019t had a chance to start our life together, everything is on hold,\u201d Depasse said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m treated like this by my own country.\u201d Depasse wanted to give birth near her family in Solihull, West Midlands, and they initially planned to have Amry, a hotel manager, come to the UK on a visitor\u2019s visa so he could be by his girlfriend\u2019s side. \u201cIt was denied twice, they believed he would not return home, despite having a job to return to. \u201cWe found out afterwards that it\u2019s very rare to get a visitor\u2019s visa if you have a partner and child here, they just don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll leave. I gave up on the hope that he would witness his son being born and I gave birth without him.\u201d Four months later, she brought Marley to meet his dad in Dubai, and the couple have met abroad whenever they can afford to. \u201cMy son has only spent a total of four weeks with his father and he\u2019s almost 18 months old,\u201d she said. \u201c[When we\u2019re there] it\u2019s more like a holiday, it\u2019s not real life. We\u2019re in a hotel, going out to eat.

The temptation might be to interpret this in a negative light, a busted ego perhaps. Only he doesn\u2019t seem the sort. He\u2019s a genial individual, and well grounded. No, it would seem to run deeper than that. Because for as long back as Meram can remember, soccer, has been a test.  First of all he had to convince the soccer luddites that despite his slight physique he could still mix it at the highest levels. And now that spirit comes in handy when he is doing the thing that marks him out in a way no else can claim: as the only Christian in the Iraqi national team. But Meram has hid a silver streak recently. He is the talented 27-year-old attacking midfielder who operated on the left wing with such aplomb for Columbus Crew last year. During their run to the 2015 MLS Cup, he scored the fastest goal in playoff history, a volley after nine seconds that knocked the stuffing out of New York Red Bulls. As the season closed, his agent noted interest in Meram from both Europe and the Middle East. But as well as that he is an unlikely international for Iraq, where both his parents were born and grew up. He is the first Chaldean Catholic in MLS, an American of Iraqi Christian parentage.            \u201cBoth of my parents met in the States, but both are from the same town, a place called Tel Kaif, which is near Mosul in the north of Iraq,\u201d he tells the Guardian. He was raised steeped in Chaldean culture. His parents remember a beautiful country, before they left, separately, as the region grew more unstable in the late 70s and early 80s. And if it was dangerous then, Meram reflects that things are much worse for Iraqi minorities in the era of Isis. \u201cThis is a sad moment in the lives of many Christian Iraqis,\u201d he says. That makes turning out for Iraq an even bigger deal than it otherwise would be for Meram. Still, when it became clear he could play for Iraq, his parents did not pressure him to accept the opportunity, letting him make up his own mind. \u201cOnce I got my passport, I could not wait to be part of the national team, representing the country of my heritage and where my family grew or were born and raised,\u201d he says. \u201cIraq was always my No1 choice as I got further into my career.\u201d Meram grew up in Shelby Township, a Detroit suburb at the heart of Iraqi Christendom in the United States. And it was there, at Eisenhower high school, that the paradox of his talent first reared its head. Despite a standout senior year, offers from top-tier colleges were not forthcoming. That led to a first fork in the road. Kicking for a college football team seemed a more realistic option. So he followed his family to Arizona, and won a place on the soccer team at Yavapai College, a junior school north of Phoenix, after he was spotted playing in a park with his brothers. There he excelled: he notched 51 goals and 30 assists in 52 games. That garnered the attention of the University of Michigan and a Division I scholarship.    Related: The MLS winter loan is dying \u2013 in part because the league is so physically taxing    Under current Columbus coach Gregg Berhalter, he has kicked on. He made his Iraq debut in 2014, but his path to international soccer was convoluted: Meram had always figured the US was his only option on the national stage. \u201cYousif Alkhafajy, an Iraqi who runs a website [about Iraqi players abroad], found me a couple of years ago,\u201d Meram explains. \u201cHe saw the name and maybe heard from someone that I was an Iraqi professional playing in the States, [and] reached out to see if I\u2019d be interested.\u201d An arduous bureaucratic process followed as he struggled to get the necessary paperwork: his parents had left decades ago and the Islamic State takeover of the Mosul area exacerbated an already tricky situation. \u201cTo be truthful, there were a lot of moments when I thought it was never going to happen,\u201d he remembers. His first appearance finally came in the 2014 Gulf Cup of Nations. He has since amassed 17 caps, scoring twice. Right now, he is the lone Christian in the ranks, flying the flag for Iraq\u2019s Chaldeans, an ancient Assyrian people who have called the region home since long before the time of Jesus. It\u2019s an honor from which he clearly extracts much pride, for his parents and for himself. But does being the only Christian in such a politically charged environment cause tension? Meram says nothing could be further from the truth.  At first the main problem was his basic Arabic, which he has since improved. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how many are Shiite and how many are Sunni, I just know I\u2019m the only Catholic or Christian guy on the team,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m isolated but they respect me and my culture. I\u2019ve learned a lot about their culture, and I respect them as well.\u201d And despite the strife that has torn apart Iraq, its football show signs of promise. Meram expects to be called up for Iraq\u2019s next set of fixtures, a key World Cup doubleheader slated for late March. They face Thailand and Vietnam for the right to progress to the next round of Asian qualifying. Sitting five points behind Thailand having played one game fewer and four ahead of Vietnam, they are fairly well poised in their group.  Still, troubles are never far from the surface: Fifa ordered the team to play their home fixtures outside of Iraq for safety reasons. The March games will take place in Iran, an erstwhile foe in recent history. \u201cIt is tough,\u201d Meram says. \u201cImagine playing in Iraq, and you get 80,000 or 90,000 supporters who are gonna scream their lungs off for you, and you can\u2019t have that home field advantage.  \u201cWe\u2019ve [moved] the games to Iran, we\u2019ve moved them to Dubai, and we\u2019re only getting 5,000 or 6,000. It almost makes it like a neutral site. Hopefully one day Iraq can come back to being the country it was.\u201d More broadly, evidence Iraqi football is on the up is fairly solid. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in 2003, the country\u2019s deep love for football has on occasion been met with victory on the field. Against the odds, they won the Asian Cup, the continent\u2019s top prize, in 2007 and will play at this year\u2019s Olympics. Still, the set-up is not above intrigue. Meram seemed to find himself in thick of it late last year. After flying more than halfway round the world for Iraq\u2019s last qualifier away to Chinese Taipei, he did not even make the bench. Given his form at both club and international level, his omission was a head scratcher. It was suggested from one angle he might have been the victim of whatever sectarian squabbles govern the national team.  But he tries to stay above politics. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right, but we won,\u201d he muses. \u201cSo there\u2019s not much I can say.\u201d Personally, he senses his ancestral homeland isn\u2019t far away from taking another footballing leap.  For now, there are scores to settle on the domestic front. Columbus burned out at the final hurdle last year, a mix of bad luck and a deficit in their own performance their undoing, Meram concedes. But there\u2019s that chip on the shoulder again. Displaying a resilience not unlike that of his father, who on first arriving in America did not speak a lick of English and made do working construction, he is unequivocal.  \u201cI look at [last year] as a successful season, but obviously with the fall in the final,\u201d Meram says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be proud. We\u2019ve been there before and we know what it takes \u2013 but looking to this season, if we don\u2019t make it back I think that\u2019s a failure.

The former England international told a court he knew for more than a year that he was \u201cperpetuating the excruciating pain\u201d for the teenager, who was being called a liar. In 30 minutes of intense cross-examination at Bradford crown court on Tuesday, Johnson told jurors he knew \u201cwhen it started getting inappropriate with the messages\u201d that he had \u201cseriously wronged\u201d the girl, who cannot be named. Prosecutor Kate Blackwell QC asked: \u201cWhen you were in your car on the 30th January engaging in sexual activity with her did you realise you had seriously wronged her?\u201d Johnson answered: \u201cYes.\u201d The footballer said he told the club\u2019s chief executive, Margaret Byrne, \u201ceverything\u201d. \u201cI said I made a huge mistake, yes,\u201d he said. However, the court heard Johnson had his suspension lifted on 18 March 2015 \u2013 16 days after his arrest \u2013 and played for the club until the Saturday before his trial started this month. Johnson had pleaded not guilty to all four child sex offences but changed his plea on 10 February, the day his trial was due to start. Blackwell asked Johnson why he threw his shirt into the crowd at the end of the match against Liverpool, his final game before he was sacked the day after his guilty pleas.  Johnson said he \u201cknew there was a possibility\u201d that was his final match for the club. He told jurors he was asked to return from suspension by the club\u2019s management. \u201cI wanted to go back to doing my job so I didn\u2019t see it was a problem,\u201d he said.  He was also asked about a photograph of him holding a beer and giving the thumbs-up sign, taken in Dubai at a stag trip for fellow Sunderland player Steven Fletcher. \u201cDid you feel you had seriously wronged [the girl] at that stage too?\u201d Blackwell asked. Johnson replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Then the prosecutor asked a series of quickfire questions, prompting one-word answers from the footballer. Blackwell asked: \u201cWhen did you plead guilty?\u201d Johnson: \u201cThe 10th of February.\u201d Blackwell: \u201cSomething which you have known for a long time?\u201d Johnson: \u201cYes.\u201d Blackwell: \u201cOver a year?\u201d Johnson: \u201cYes.\u201d Blackwell: \u201cSomething which you knew from the start but were there 60,000 very good reasons each week?\u201d Johnson: \u201cNo, I had no control over fans.\u201d     Adam Johnson throws his Sunderland shirt into the crowd at Anfield on 6 February. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA    Blackwell: \u201cNo, Mr Johnson, \u00a360,000 a week \u2013 was that preying on your mind?\u201d Johnson: \u201cNo.\u201d Blackwell: \u201cEach week that you played for the football club and refused to confirm your guilt was another week perpetuating the excruciating pain for the girl?\u201d Johnson: \u201cYes.\u201d Blackwell: \u201cShe endured a year of being called a liar and a slag while you encouraged your fans to cheer you on?\u201d Johnson: \u201cYes, but I can\u2019t control what people say. It\u2019s not on my behalf.\u201d Johnson went on to deny that he hoped the girl would drop the allegations before they reached trial. He also denied he had taken advantage of the girl. In this first question of the cross-examination, Blackwell asked: \u201cAre you a man of honour?\u201d to which Johnson replied: \u201cNo.\u201d After meeting the girl to give her a signed Sunderland shirt, the court heard that Johnson texted her to say: \u201cYou owe me lol,\u201d and later: \u201cI thought I would\u2019ve got a thank you kiss for the shirt.\u201d   Related: Adam Johnson 'ashamed' by flirty text messages to schoolgirl    In cross-examination, the footballer admitted he hoped she would take the \u201cyou owe me lol\u201d text to mean she owed him a sexual favour. Asked about the \u201cthank you kiss\u201d text, Johnson agreed he thought it would encourage her to have sexual activity with him later. The footballer said he considered going \u201cfurther than a kiss\u201d with the girl when he met her on 30 January but denied any sexual activity took place. Jurors heard that Johnson texted the girl before the encounter to say he was looking forward to a kiss and \u201ca bit of feeling\u201d. When asked by Blackwell where on her body he had in mind, Johnson told jurors: \u201cHer private parts.\u201d But asked why \u2013 on his account \u2013 it went no further than kissing, Johnson added: \u201cBecause when I had the kiss, as I said yesterday, I knew it was wrong and I didn\u2019t want it to carry on any further.\u201d The sexual encounter is alleged to have taken place when Johnson was on his way to the Stadium of Light to meet the team before their match the next day, the court has heard. Johnson said lots of players would turn up to the meetings a little bit after 6pm and be fined \u201cjust \u00a3100, \u00a3200\u201d increasing to \u201ca few hundred\u201d pounds depending on the lateness. The footballer agreed with the prosecutor that he was prepared to a pay a fine in order to spend more time with the schoolgirl. Earlier on Tuesday, his second day of giving evidence, Johnson told the court he gave his mobile number to the girl because he was sexually attracted to her. He said he was in \u201cturmoil\u201d after being arrested on suspicion of child sex offences by police on 2 March last year. Jurors heard that Johnson told his girlfriend while being arrested that the girl \u201csaid she was 16\u201d. Asked why he said that when he knew it to be untrue, he told jurors: \u201cAt the time I panicked. I wanted a chance to come home and explain to Stacey what had happened \u2013 I didn\u2019t want not to have a chance to explain. She could have left home and taken my daughter away.\u201d Johnson said he went to his parents\u2019 home after being released on bail and told his girlfriend \u201ceverything\u201d, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t describe how hard it was and how bad it was for her.\u201d  The former Manchester City player, capped 12 times for England, said he tried to \u201cdownplay\u201d his feelings for the girl and their kiss during his police interview. He told jurors he could not believe the allegations she made to police, that they performed two sex acts on each other, which he denies. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the things she was saying to the police and I felt like someone was making her say these things for the benefit of herself,\u201d he said.

She also writes brilliantly about dogs. Her debut, How I Live Now, showed the desirability of a capable border collie in the event of a dystopian breakdown of society. Mila, the 12-year-old at the heart of Rosoff\u2019s most recent novel, Picture Me Gone, reckons she may have inherited the soul of a terrier. She is also deeply attached to a golden labrador that she describes as \u201ca watcher, like me. Her eyes have a sadness that is almost human.\u201d (And though the theological satire There Is No Dog was true to its word, the adolescent boy revealed as being responsible for creating the universe did have a loyal lemur-like thing called Eck.) It was always on the cards, therefore, that Rosoff \u2013 whose biography includes mention of two lurchers \u2013 would one day write a novel about dogs. What is more unexpected is that it should also be her first work of fiction aimed at an adult readership. At least, it is the first book in which the principal character has progressed beyond his teens; though whether this means he has successfully completed his adolescence remains theoretical. The book commences with one of Rosoff\u2019s great, attention-grabbing opening lines: \u201cJonathan came home from work one day to find the dogs talking about him. They weren\u2019t even his dogs.\u201d Home is a sublet single-bed apartment in New York\u2019s Lower East Side; the dogs belong to Jonathan\u2019s brother, who has flitted off to fulfil an engineering contract in Dubai. Rosoff animates these animals with a sense of personality that any dog-owner should recognise. Dante is a hyper-intelligent border collie living in a city where even the availability of liver cookies from specialist dog bakeries cannot disguise the fact that Manhattan is possibly the most inappropriate place on earth for a hyper-intelligent border collie to live. Sissy, meanwhile, is a sweet-natured spaniel who \u201clooked yearningly into Jonathan\u2019s face as if searching for the key to her future \u2026 I\u2019m hungry, I need more love, we\u2019re bored here all day, please turn over the reins of your life so we can sort you out.\u201d   Related: Meg Rosoff: 'It took 12 years for the hate to compost down into comedy\u2019    The dogs are correct in their perception that Jonathan\u2019s life requires sorting. He loathes his job writing soul-destroying advertising copy for office supplies. And he is not entirely sure about his girlfriend, Julie, an ambitious staffer on a bridal magazine who proposes marriage on the basis that the publication will pay for the wedding in return for exclusive rights to stage the ceremony. But Jonathan\u2019s greatest anxiety remains that his brother might at any moment return from the Middle East to reclaim his pets: \u201cThe thought of the dogs leaving was intolerable to him. Once he married Julie he\u2019d be totally alone.\u201d These may be adult concerns, yet Rosoff finds no reason to modify or restrain her style. Jonathan is prone to cartoonish flights of fantasy that throw his breakdown on the day of the wedding into frightening relief. The only slight disappointment is that such exuberant invention is ultimately placed at the service of a sentimental, romcom resolution. But if the novel lacks some of the blazing originality of her children\u2019s writing, Rosoff\u2019s primary theme hasn\u2019t changed. Whether dealing with characters in their teens or their 20s, Rosoff\u2019s fiction has always engaged with the mystery of adulthood and where it comes from. As Mila puts it in Picture Me Gone: \u201cI wonder at what point a child becomes a person? Does it happen all at once, or slowly, in stages? Is there an age, a week, a moment at which the secrets of the universe are revealed and adulthood descends on a cloud from heaven, altering the brain forever?\u201d If so, Jonathan is still waiting for it to happen. \u201cHow did normal people cross the huge gulf between childhood and adulthood?\u201d he wonders. \u201cHe\u2019d always assumed it would just happen \u2013 one day he\u2019d wake up and find himself on the other side.\u201d If Rosoff\u2019s adult fiction turns out to be indivisible from her teenage fiction, it\u2019s because she continues to patrol the perilously ill-defined border between the two. But she makes it clear that at least you can depend on dogs to offer uncomplicated companionship in the face of such uncertainty. As Jonathan\u2019s vet remarks: \u201cDogs tend naturally towards happiness. That\u2019s why humans choose to live with them.\u201d \u2022 To order Jonathan Unleashed for \u00a311.99 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

But spurred by a UN report supporting the claims of torture, another North American family\u2019s campaign and growing frustration with the UAE, Kamal\u2019s eldest daughter broke her silence this week. \u201cMy dad was literally kidnapped from home,\u201d Amal Eldarat, 27, told the Guardian. Her father was an unlikely abductee: a real estate developer who raised his family in California and London, and worked in Dubai since 1998 without incident. But the night of 26 August 2014, a day after reports that the UAE and Egypt had intervened in Libya\u2019s civil war with airstrikes, several black cars rolled up to the Eldarat\u2019s home.      Kamal Eldarat with daughter Isra. Photograph: Amal Eldarat    Eldarat, who recently moved to Washington to help with her family\u2019s case, said large men \u201clike club bouncers\u201d rushed into their Dubai home, followed in by a woman in uniform who refused to answer questions or show a warrant. The woman then locked Eldarat and her mother in a room for more than an hour, while the men rifled through belongings and surrounded the head of the family. \u201cI was screaming \u2018don\u2019t sign anything\u2019 as I went upstairs to grab his glasses,\u201d Eldarat said, \u201cand as I came downstairs one of the men took the glasses, and the next thing I know I\u2019m running outside and seeing him put in this normal, black car with Abu Dhabi plates. It happened so quickly.\u201d The house was left in tatters. The state security officers, who eventually became familiar faces to the family, had taken laptops, iPhones, an iPad and the home\u2019s security system. The next day, Eldarat\u2019s brother, 34-year-old Mohamed, started asking after his father at police stations, the US embassy, the foreign ministry, all without any answers. Then UAE state security called to say they had questions for him, and arrived at the house at night, Amal Eldarat said. She answered the door again \u2013 \u201cI said, \u2018Oh God, it\u2019s you guys again\u201d \u2013 and her brother was hustled into another black car. For months, Amal Eldarat, her mother, sisters and US consular services could not locate the prisoners. \u201cEvery day my mom was crying and screaming, \u2018What do you mean, how can they just disappear?\u2019\u201d Eldarat said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know who these people are, maybe it\u2019s some gang, they had no warrant, no uniform, no sign of any official authority.\u201d The Eldarats, a Canadian-Libyan, and three other Libyan businessmen were rounded up that week in 2014; though one Libyan was released four months later and promptly deported, none were formally charged until 18 January 2016, when a judge finally told them they stood accused of supporting terrorism. The five prisoners have accused the UAE of torturing them, and a UN report published last week concurred, citing \u201creliable information on the acts of torture\u201d such as visible injuries. The Eldarats and the UN have said their confessions were coerced by torture, and the family maintains that the pair have never supported terrorism.   Related: US, Canadian and Libyan businessmen charged in UAE after 500 days in jail    About five months after his arrest, Kamal Eldarat was allowed to call home. He learned from his wife that his son had also disappeared. \u201cHe was in ultimate shock,\u201d Amal said. Not long after, Mohamed also called, as did the other prisoners to their families. None would speak about release. Eventually, the prisoners were moved out of secret detention to a normal prison. Kamal Eldarat described his time in the state security prison as \u201cthe darkest days in his life\u201d, his daughter said. She paraphrased his own account: \u201cIt\u2019s not a prison, it\u2019s a technological haunted house, with lighting [effects], strange noises, hallucinations and torture: beatings, hot showers like waterboarding, electrocuting.\u201d Guards performed a mock execution on her brother, she said, leaving him hanging for several minutes in his cell.  Only after weeks of wrangling by consular officials did the family manage a visit. \u201cMy dad was like a walking skeleton, aged 30 years. It was like he was gone,\u201d Amal said, adding that she could notice bruises on his arms. He complained about back pains and a lack of medical care. Similarly, her brother said he was losing his hearing, and by last month\u2019s court appearance his left ear had ceased to function. In their first, 20-minute court hearing last month, neither the Eldarats or Alaradi were allowed a lawyer. Eleven days later, their lawyer was given a copy of his clients\u2019 file, which finally told him that they were charged under a terrorism law that was enacted after their arrest.  The file consists of 200 pages of typed confessions and signatures at the very end, Amal said: \u201cNo bank statements, no materials, no evidence, nothing.\u201d Since becoming disillusioned by Emirati officials, who claimed the family\u2019s silence would better secure her relatives\u2019 release, Amal quit her job as a financial analyst in Dubai and started campaigning full-time to press members of Congress in Washington on her family\u2019s behalf. The UN also called for the case to be dismissed in its report, saying: \u201cAll of [the prisoners] were deprived of the right to challenge their arrest and detention before the judicial authorities and subjected to enforced disappearance, secret and incommunicado detention.\u201d The US has had a more muted response to its Emirati ally, which has joined the coalition campaign against Isis in Syria and which hosts a joint US-UAE anti-terrorism agency in Abu Dhabi.  Mark Toner, a deputy spokesman for the Department of State, said that embassy officials had attended the January hearing and all subsequent hearings. Toner said that US officials know of the torture claims and \u201chave raised these allegations with senior leaders of the UAE government\u201d. He said they also requested \u201caccess to medical care and appropriate treatment while in prison\u201d. The UAE embassy and foreign ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but its ambassador to the US, Yousef al Otaiba, emailed a Washington Post editorial editor a statement that said the men have been treated \u201cin accordance with international fair trial standards\u201d.   Related: Canadian family pleads for father detained in the UAE: 'torture until I wished for death'    Human rights groups and the Eldarats, however, maintain that the detentions and trials are politically motivated. Although the three men have spent decades raising families in the west and working in the UAE, they have roots in western Libya, a region at war with eastern factions since the country overthrew dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The UAE has cracked down on dissent and taken a more active role abroad since the Arab uprisings of 2011. Late last year, Amnesty International suggested that the detention of a prominent academic meant a new effort to stifle free speech, and Human Rights Watch has documented a string of arbitrary detentions and torture reports in the country. \u201cAny country whose citizens earn their living in the UAE should express their great concern over these torture allegations,\u201d said Joe Stork, HRW\u2019s regional director. \u201cThis is a country where the state security apparatus is accused over and over of torturing people to get confessions.\u201d Mosaab Ahmed Abd el Aziz, an Egyptian held in the same prison as the Eldarats, recently managed to get a statement to HRW. \u201cIf I was asked to confess to coming from Mars to destroy Earth,\u201d Abd el Aziz said, \u201cI would have, just to get it over with.\u201d", "title": "Two Americans detained in UAE to go on trial after 505 days without charges", "sentences": ["Her father was an unlikely abductee: a real estate developer who raised his family in California and London, and worked in Dubai since 1998 without incident.", "Photograph: Amal Eldarat    Eldarat, who recently moved to Washington to help with her family\u2019s case, said large men \u201clike club bouncers\u201d rushed into their Dubai home, followed in by a woman in uniform who refused to answer questions or show a warrant.", "The file consists of 200 pages of typed confessions and signatures at the very end, Amal said: \u201cNo bank statements, no materials, no evidence, nothing.\u201d Since becoming disillusioned by Emirati officials, who claimed the family\u2019s silence would better secure her relatives\u2019 release, Amal quit her job as a financial analyst in Dubai and started campaigning full-time to press members of Congress in Washington on her family\u2019s behalf."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-24T16:57:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/25/thursday-best-tv-death-paradise-jericho-british-sex-survey", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "Ugly House to Lovely\u00a0House with\u00a0George Clarke 8pm, Channel 4 The title leaves little to the imagination.

I want her to be whatever she wants. And I want people to respect her.\u201d These words were spoken by Mohammad, a middle-aged Saudi-Arabian partner of a major global management consultancy, during a panel debate I recently attended in Riyadh. I found his ambitions for his daughter easy to identify with. They parallel with my feelings about the freedoms and rights I expect for my own eight-year-old daughter.  Sadly, it would seem not everyone shares Mohammad\u2019s sentiments. Saudi Arabia ranks 20th out of 22 for women\u2019s rights in the Arab states, and 130th out of 142 countries measured in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap report.    If Saudi Arabia is to pool its resources of female talent it needs women to be represented in the boardroom.     The western media has extensively covered women\u2019s disenfranchisement in the country, and I don\u2019t just mean the ban on driving; women cannot travel freely and are mostly excluded from the world outside the home. The biggest issue here is the male guardianship of women, meaning that they need their male guardians\u2019 permission to marry, travel, leave the country and enrol in education.  Many have argued for women\u2019s equality on purely moral terms, and those are valid arguments. But they aren\u2019t the only ones. There is also corporate and national profitability to be considered and for many who reject western morality, a purely financial argument might prove more compelling.  The volatility of the oil markets means that the country can no longer rely on its primary industry as a reliable source of wealth. Soon, Saudi Arabia will have to play by the same rules as other industrialised countries: it will need to diversify and take its place in the economy of human capital. But women make up only 16% of the Saudi workforce, standing much in line with the 14% of the UAE and 19% in Bahrain. How can a country deprived of 55% of its workforce compete with nations that are more than happy to pool all of their human resources? The lowering of oil prices should serve as a resounding clarion call for a nation that needs to plan for a near-future in which oil wells are drying up. It is time to drill into a far richer well, that of talented, modern women. Women like Mohammad\u2019s daughter. A well that need never run dry.  Change is inevitable, and it has already begun. During my time in Saudi, I witnessed the early blossoming of a female subculture. Women who might still be subject to harsh rules of \u201cguardianship\u201d are finding ways to communicate with each other via social networks. And, whether they are inspired by fine-art, sculpture or video game vlogging, things are changing faster than one might expect.  In just one generation the country has moved from 5% to almost 100% literacy. A staggering 70% of the population is under 30 years old, meaning a more youthful and less traditional perspective is possible. Women may still be barred from participation in most mainstream cultural establishments but they are no longer silent.    Related: Saudi Arabia labour market reforms bring change at the checkouts    In 2015 women voted for the first time in the municipal councils. More than half (55%) of the graduates from Saudi universities are now women. And women employment is one of the top priorities of the governmental agenda. Speaking at this year\u2019s Munich Security Conference, the Saudi Arabian foreign minister assured delegates that women would soon be allowed to drive and that the prohibition was a societal rather than religious issue. While this proposal came with no specific schedule, one cannot help feeling that the kingdom\u2019s government is increasingly aware of just how untenable women\u2019s current situation of rights deprivation has become.  While Saudi women might largely be excluded from the workforce, I also witnessed a corporate Saudi Arabia which is very much a world apart. Here I encountered business \u201ccompounds\u201d \u2013 privately owned towns built to house the employees of multinational companies. The largest of these compounds are as big as small cities. Within the walls of the compound of Saudi Aramco, the oil giant that is estimated to be the world\u2019s most valuable company, I saw women and men behaving freely, much as they do in other more liberal Arab nations. Women do not have to wear the abaya (black robe), which is obligatory on the streets of most major Saudi cities. There\u2019s also an (unwritten) understanding that the muttawa (the religious police) do not attempt to enforce gender segregation or dress codes on private property. But as I look over Mohammad\u2019s shoulder and scan the room, there are no women. The panel of corporate pundits consists exclusively of men. Whilst I did see women on other panels, if Saudi Arabia is to pool its resources of female talent it needs women to be represented in the boardroom to get their voices heard. And, more than ever, it needs the private sector to lead this shift. Saudi Arabia\u2019s future is poised on a fine balance. There may have been no female pundits on Mohammad\u2019s panel but the men I spoke to did at least admit their openness to address the issue of women\u2019s rights and their importance to the future economy of the country \u2013 one that needs to compete with other Arab countries such as Bahrain and Dubai.  It is a pressing need and the value of women must be recognised.

It started really with a sort of blankness and open-endedness. Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi: You have to put it in context. In 1997, Lagos was still very much under the radar; in the architectural world for sure, but in the wider world too. RK: Nigeria was a blank on the map \u2013 there weren\u2019t even any maps. The US State Department, everyone said don\u2019t go there. It was courageous of Harvard University: the notion was that we would match Harvard students with Nigerian students, so that every student would have a guide, creating a guarantee of intimacy with the city. Kunl\u00e9 was one of the students we recruited locally. But Lagos at that point was not very inviting even to Lagosians. It was considered a no-go zone, almost in its entirety. KA: The security risk was a lot higher then. There was a lot of crime in several pockets, and it was a very difficult city to navigate. You needed to be a real cowboy to go to Lagos.    It was the ultimate dysfunctional city \u2013 but actually, in terms of all the initiatives and ingenuity, almost utopian  Rem Koolhaas     RK: And there were simply no maps. It was all rumour, an unbelievable amount of rumour \u2013 largely about crime and almost mythical manifestations of evil. KA: [Laughs] RK: It was a city that had been turned against itself. There was a bridge that became the perfect trap for crimes, which began with nails being scattered to cause flat tyres. If the driver stopped, the car would be dismantled in 20 minutes and the parts thrown overboard [to people waiting below]. The system had turned into a kind of destructive device that could be used against people. That was the narrative. KA: But you took a lot of pride in that notion that you could actually survive in Lagos. This place that was very difficult to live in also offered up a lot of opportunities. RK: It was a kind of narcissism of difficulty, so in that sense it was almost an emancipation machine.     Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi and Rem Koolhaas at the OMA offices in Rotterdam    GC: How did it affect your work? RK: Kunl\u00e9\u2019s a Lagosian now [Adeyemi grew up in Kaduna in northern Nigeria] and he\u2019s building a career there. But Lagos has also had a particular effect on my career. I was there early, and although it was a courageous step to go there and invest on this scale \u2013 I went there maybe 20 times \u2013 it\u2019s also been also super-controversial. There\u2019s an old school of thought that somebody like me has no place to go there. GC: Because you\u2019re not Nigerian. RK: Yeah, because of colonialism and so on ... [The American journalist] George Packer saw our presence there as just kind of \u2018slumming it\u2019. He described it as tourism by car, and then ultimately by helicopter. But it was not some kind of exotic excursion. It was a collaborative effort to clarify, understand and educate. KA: I remember, for a long time you didn\u2019t actually want to intervene. The first project we did [the fourth mainland bridge proposal], it was through a lot of my interests that Rem agreed to it \u2013 there was never an intention to immediately intervene.     Rendering of Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi and Rem Koolhaas\u2019s proposal for the Fourth Mainland Bridge in Lagos, Nigeria. Illustration: Courtesy OMA    RK: Because of that innuendo, in the end we didn\u2019t publish. It was a book that was killed by the response of other people. Which sounds quite cowardly, perhaps, but it was the first manifestation of what is currently a really big issue: how political correctness defines the limits of what you can do. In that sense, it was super-exciting and maybe the most magical project we did, but at the same time fraught with mixed feelings. GC: Did you learn any lessons from Lagos that you could apply to other cities? RK: The real thing we tried to look at is what happens to a society when the state is absent. At that point, the state had really withdrawn from Lagos; the city was left to its own devices, both in terms of money and services. That, by definition, created an unbelievable proliferation of independent agency: each citizen needed to take, in any day, maybe 400 or 500 independent decisions on how to survive that extremely complex system. That was why the title [of the unpublished book] became Lagos: How it Works, because it was the ultimate dysfunctional city \u2013 but actually, in terms of all the initiatives and ingenuity, it mobilised an incredibly beautiful, almost utopian landscape of independence and agency. KA: Self-organisation ...    It's a city for intellectuals and cowboys  Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi     RK: For example, there was this railroad [he draws]. Initially the trains drove with some frequency, but the frequency diminished to the point where there were only two trains a day. However, the line had created a lot of communities, and therefore density \u2013 so every time the train was not driving, this whole area became a marketplace. At some point the train would drive, but at such a pace that you could sell things to the passengers as it went along \u2013 so the slowness was very functional in terms of creating opportunity of interaction and trade.  We also discovered a person who had a fish stall, and within a single square metre she carried two children all the way to Harvard. She supported an unbelievable escape of her children into education. In that sense it was a city completed pixillated, and every pixel contained amazing stories. KA: Lagos is a city that\u2019s very anxious \u2013 probably back then a lot more than it is now. Everyone is always in a hurry. Everyone needs to get ahead of the other.     \u2018It looks like total chaos, but after a while you learn to recognise that it\u2019s not\u2019 ... Lagos in 1997. Photograph: Rem Koolhaas/OMA    GC: Is it a kind of capitalist utopia? RK: I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s all about survival. KA: The key thing was: that\u2019s the organisation; that\u2019s the birth of a growing city. Lagos back then was 10-12 million people. RK: It looks like total chaos, but after a while you learn to recognise that it\u2019s not total chaos, because here are green things together, here are rusty things together, here are plastic things together. There\u2019s a constant ordering going on, and a constant disordering at the same time. KA: If you just look at this image of the market [pictured below] without the lines drawn on, you get a sense that nothing\u2019s happening, there\u2019s no order. But then you see people selling tomatoes on one line, and everyone is organised across their little paths ... GC: Yet with no one actually ordering it?     Koolhaas and Adeyemi rented a helicopter to discern patterns in the apparent Lagos chaos. Photograph: Rem Koolhaas/OMA    KA: There are some local regulators, let\u2019s say. Like the market women, the head of the markets, the local collectors. Actually this entire space is also taxed: they are local taxes, not taxes that are going to the government, but there\u2019s someone who maintains order here; there\u2019s some degree of law enforcement. GC: Is that corruption? KA: It\u2019s self-regulation at a time when, as Rem said, there was no state, or it couldn\u2019t manage a growing population \u2013 nothing could. The politics, the development, they couldn\u2019t catch up. It was really moving very fast. It\u2019s only now that Lagos is getting to a point where the state has been able to implement a degree of order. The institutions are working better now, the banks are much more functional. At this time, 1997, there were no mobile phones! It\u2019s a whole different thing now with mobile phones: technology has created a form of regulation, because people can actually talk to each other a lot more. GC: Has it changed the city\u2019s informal patterns? RK: It has normalised them, in a way.   Related: Beatings and bribes: the corruption behind Lagos's traffic jams    KA: And it has increased the activities. You might imagine that now we have phones, we\u2019re not going to move around so much \u2013 but the opposite is true, it\u2019s that you know where to go. Trading is different, the economy has grown substantially. RK: That has been another interesting discovery: that basically a city could recover from a really deep, deep, deep pit. KA: And in a very short time. We\u2019re only talking 20 years ago, here. Fast forward 15 years \u2013 and especially in the last five years, Lagos has seen so many changes, so many improvements. RK: At that time, if you drove through the city, you drove through a foreground that always seemed to be incredibly dramatic and incredibly agonised \u2013 smoking, burning, incredible compression. In the first year we stayed on the ground and went everywhere. But then in order to discover whether this was the whole story, we rented a helicopter. And we began to understand that this is not chaos but a highly modern system that had been abandoned, then at some point went into reversal, then slowly came out of it. GC: What\u2019s changed recently? KA: In the last five years the economy improved, the government became more stable, the security improved. When there\u2019s more security in an environment, people are able to invest more. And even more interesting is the cultural scene: there\u2019s a huge music industry, the arts are thriving ... These are signs of a healthier environment, socially and culturally.    That has been another interesting discovery: that basically a city could recover from a really deep, deep, deep pit  Rem Koolhaas     In Lagos, a lot more infrastructure is being put in place, roads are being built, the highways are improved. Not to say that you wouldn\u2019t see some remnants of this [indicates the market pictured above]; there are large parts of Lagos that remain this way. But there is now a semblance of a healthier and livable society. People actually now think about coming to Lagos on holiday. [laughs] GC: What about the Eko-Atlantic development? Isn\u2019t that the opposite of the informal market? KA: To me, Eko-Atlantic is a project that tried to address the second challenge Lagos faces \u2013 one is urbanisation, and the other is climate change. Eko-Atlantic was meant to be a project that reclaimed the shoreline and protected Victoria Island, one of the city\u2019s most expensive pieces of real estate, to the south-east. The idea in itself is really great \u2013 but there have been a lot of questions around its implementation, and the impact on the rest of the city.  Of course if you simply just push water back, it will find other ways \u2013 so there have been areas that have been impacted by it negatively. And when you\u2019re densifying an area that\u2019s already super-dense, there\u2019s a question as to whether the city\u2019s infrastructure can cope. We\u2019re hoping that as the project develops, it\u2019s being modified to address these problems. RK: Yet even this is part of a process of the normalisation of Lagos, in that nobody in their right minds would have thought a second about ecology before \u2013 everything was a question of totally myopic (but smart) preoccupation with the next second.     The seven unpublished books about Lagos produced by Rem Koolhaas, Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi and Harvard Univeristy. Photograph: Chris Michael    GC: Is Eko-Atlantic a form of social or climate apartheid? RK: It\u2019s typical of our contemporary kind of world. I think that inequality was probably smaller [when we were there]. You need to look at inequality as a typical condition of modern society. KA: The notion is to create a city to increase the economic opportunities, but I think that the real-estate values of a place like Eko-Atlantic is just really, really high. It\u2019s a very ambitious project, and I think Lagos thinks to itself \u2013 or some of its leaders \u2013 oh, we deserve a place like Dubai. GC: Would you say Lagos is a resilient city? RK: It\u2019s super-resilient in the old way, but not in the contemporary definition. KA: Absolutely super-resilient. The capacity for survival on an individual level and collectively is just amazing, and that\u2019s perhaps the reason Lagos is where it is today: because people are innovative, they are ready to adapt, they are ready to fight, they are ready to live in different kinds of conditions. There\u2019s just this notion, there\u2019s a pride \u2013 everyone believes that things will be better. You can also see a polarity in the city \u2013 you see your next-door neighbour doing a lot better \u2013 and that diversity creates a tension to survive. It\u2019s a city that is very mixed \u2013 the rich have to be working with the poor. The middle class was almost non-existent a long time ago, but now you find a lot more people going to museums, watching movies, going to parks \u2013 it\u2019s becoming a more liveable city.     The colonial is now such a major taboo that any achievement of the period is fundamentally not recognised. That\u2019s crazy  Rem Koolhaas     RK: There\u2019s something really interesting about current urbanism: the only model is the universal model, and there is increasingly incapacity to consider the virtues and the qualities that are there, and then to build on them. The only thing is complete transformation.  But in Lagos there\u2019s a really strong case to resurrect strong parts. Embedded in all of it are some amazing pieces of planning, amazing pieces of engineering and interaction. For instance, the campus of Lagos University is stunningly beautiful, efficient and generous, and that needs to be recognised and preserved. KA: Yeah, there are clusters of communities, outdoor living, market spaces ... When you\u2019re thinking about new shopping environments in a place like Lagos, well it\u2019s fun to be in a mall sometimes, but can we rethink it much greater? Maybe there\u2019s a hybrid: the market-mall? RK: Why I talked about political correctness: the colonial is now such a major taboo that any achievement of the colonial period, or any generosity implied in colonialism, is again fundamentally neglected or fundamentally not recognised. That\u2019s crazy, because history is a series of layers, and you cannot say, \u201cThis layer I support and this layer I cancel.\u201d History is history and you cannot retrospectively manipulate it.     \u2018Maybe there\u2019s a hybrid: the market-mall?\u2019 ... visualisation for a proposed Fourth Mainland Bridge. Illustration: Courtesy OMA    KA: Certainly in the remnants and fragments of the infrastructure produced in the colonial era, one can really see how they\u2019ve been useful in taking the city to a certain extent. Now, maybe the transformation has not been thought out carefully, but it\u2019s been very instrumental for the development of the city and it\u2019s not something we can completely erase. RK: I studied in London in 1968. Our school had a separate department of tropical architecture. Of course it was totally unfashionable, partly because nobody wanted to think about colonialism, but basically what you learned there was that, OK, the sun is here, so you should create natural ventilation here \u2013 an unbelievable amount of really sound principles that have been completely abandoned, so now everything is air conditioned with big machines. Everyone is talking about sustainability and resilience, yet all that knowledge is thrown in the bin. [Lagos is] a unique case, but also a test case. It\u2019s unbelievably unique, but also it\u2019s now considered with a number of really generic opinions, generic solution, generic expectations. KA: That\u2019s so true. My father was one of the first modernist architects who also worked with the colonial or post-colonial architects. He started his practice in the early 1960s. I grew up understanding architecture by understanding the environment: cross-ventilation was very important \u2013 the sun, the orientation of the building, the garden, the space, everything was completely thought out.           Video: Welcome to water world \u2013 the story behind the floating school of Makoko    RK: Coherent and mutually reinforcing. KA: He did large-scale buildings and still they needed to be naturally ventilated. So there\u2019s a lot in the history \u2013 whether it\u2019s local history, or histories that have been imported, international practices \u2013 that have been very useful, and that we are forgetting. GC: You can see that in your Makoko Floating School. What else would you do now to positively support the transformation of Lagos? KA: Because the city has become more stable, there\u2019s now a greater drive even for things that were previously unimaginable, like tourism. The minister of tourism is really working hard to change the perception of Lagos, and actually use the attributes of Lagos as an attraction point. I really admire that.      The booming music scene in Lagos could be a draw for tourism \u2013 an unimaginable idea 20 years ago. Photograph: Logor Oluwamuyiwa    One of the things he says is that Lagos is such an energetic city: whether in terms of culture or other activities, people like to go out. So let Lagos have big huge parties and celebrate! I think that\u2019s great. Another friend of mine says there are two types of people who come to Lagos: the intellectuals, who really want to understand it, really want to solve it; and the cowboys, the entrepreneurs, who want to make money. So it\u2019s a place of opportunity for both intellectuals and cowboys, and I think that\u2019s such a great idea. GC: What could other cities learn from Lagos?   Related: Welcome to Guardian Lagos Week \u2013 live    RK: They could learn not to panic. We live in a society where risk is systematically reduced. Where risk is replaced by comfort. So I think if people could learn anything, it\u2019s that risk remains crucial to an animated and intelligent society. KA: When you think that in only 20 years, there\u2019s been such a change in Lagos \u2026 cities actually grow faster than humans now. You can develop a whole city in less than 20 years. And in 20 years, Lagos has almost completely transformed itself. Why panic?

Just a quick look at a photo of this modern masterpiece will tell you it is special. There\u2019s a softness to it that sensually collides with its squared abstract form. This is dream art, of a radical and eerie kind. One circular scoop in the white plaster conjures an eye, a slit makes a mouth, and a bigger circular recession suggests \u2026 what?     Alberto Giacometti made Femme in 1928-29. Photograph: The Department for Culture, Media and Sport    This is a startling, sexualised sculpture that has a lot in common with Giacometti\u2019s similarly provocative Spoon Woman, created a year or so earlier, not to mention with Picasso\u2019s rollicking distortions of female form done in the same era. It was the time of surrealism. Giacometti, a Swiss artist with a classical training and innate gift for sculpture, was a core member of the surrealist movement and Femme is a dangerous explosive manifestation of unruly desires and fantasies. While its plaster softness is alluring, its sharp angles intimate violence and threat, in a way reminiscent of Giacometti\u2019s horrific 1932 sculpture Woman with Her Throat Cut. All of which is to say that Femme probably has no chance of being \u201csaved for the nation\u201d. This marvellous (in the sense of the word used by the surrealist leader Andr\u00e9 Breton, meaning subversive and irrational) work of art is on sale by a British owner for \u00a32,083,500. The culture minister, Ed Vaizey, has put a temporary export ban on it to give galleries a chance to raise the money. The form is that a museum or other institution has to get a campaign going, whip up support, and scrape together the cash to keep this masterpiece out of the hands of Johnny Foreigner This way of keeping Britain\u2019s public galleries stocked with art is a fig leaf to hide woefully inadequate funding and shabby lack of government interest in strengthening our collections. It also depends on fake, nationalistic arguments that rarely add much to anyone\u2019s knowledge of art. To \u201csell\u201d Femme to the public, for example, Vaizey has tried to put a patriotic spin on this European masterpiece. Femme came to Britain when it was bought by the British artist Winifred Nicholson in the 1930s. It is therefore the kind of work that homegrown Brit modernists like Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth saw and emulated. \u201cThis Giacometti sculpture is not only a stunning example of his work,\u201d Vaizey therefore says, \u201cbut also heavily influenced some our greatest artists. It is important that Femme is kept in the country so we can better understand and enjoy this pivotal period in modern British art.\u201d Oh God, oh no \u2013 please. To say this work of art is important we shouldn\u2019t have to embalm it in the dead air of St Ives and mummify it in Henry Moore\u2019s flat cap. Giacometti is not important because a few minor British modernists imitated him. Our parochial belief that Moore and his contemporaries were in the same league as the great European modern artists is embarrassing. Femme is not somehow \u201cBritish\u201d. It is a completely continental, hardcore surrealist masterpiece whose uncanny eroticism has nothing to do with Babs Hepworth\u2019s boring seaside and everything to do with the flea markets, brothels, bars and mental hospitals of 1920s Paris.   Related: Alberto Giacometti sculpture barred from leaving UK    But would that make it sound like something to be saved \u201cfor the nation\u201d? The very phrase, and the worthy campaigns that use it, imply a narrow sense of national property that has nothing to do with great art. Almost all the works that have been bought after such campaigns in recent years are European, and not British, masterpieces, from Titian\u2019s Diana and Actaeon to Manet\u2019s Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus \u2013 and they do not belong by some innate right to Britain. We just happened to have them and didn\u2019t want to let them go. So should we just abandon Giacometti\u2019s Femme to the global art market? After all, we can all see online images of it, as you are doing now. The question needs turning on its head. Instead of drumming up sentimental campaigns to cling on to artistic assets, why are we not buying art for the nation at auctions in New York? This whole culture of \u201csaving\u201d art is a way of disguising the poverty of our museums. They are all sitting on collections created largely in the heyday of the British empire. In the 19th century we were the world\u2019s Dubai, buying up art at eye-watering prices. In the 20th century the purse emptied and today\u2019s worthy culture of poorly funded public collections grew up, with all its little hypocrisies. The idea that by slapping a temporary export ban on a masterpiece the culture minister is doing anything for art is surely the worst of those hypocrisies. If a work of art really needs to be in this country, there should be a public fund to buy it outright. It should not be left to the enthusiasm of museums and the public. Giacometti\u2019s wicked surrealist woman really does need to stay in Britain because we don\u2019t have enough first-rate pieces of modernist art. The government should buy it for Tate Modern. And if there isn\u2019t enough money to do that, how about selling off some of our excess Henry Moores to create a proper national purchasing fund? You can flog the Nicholsons and Bloomsbury group paintings too.

As his four-year-old hurdler Wolfcatcher goes on trial for Cheltenham at Kempton on Saturday afternoon, Ferguson will be watching in Sydney, at 1am. He is then due in Dubai on Wednesday ahead of \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d at Meydan next weekend and will land back in Britain a week before the Festival. The reason for Ferguson\u2019s punishing schedule is his recent promotion from his long-standing role as Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s bloodstock adviser to become chief executive and racing manager of Godolphin, the most extensive bloodstock operation in the business. He will relinquish his National Hunt trainer\u2019s licence at the end of April to concentrate on Godolphin but not before a final attempt to saddle a winner at the sport\u2019s showpiece meeting. Ferguson has spent five years giving horses that are surplus to requirements at Godolphin a new career over jumps. He stormed through the early months of the season at or near the top of the trainers\u2019 championship and a Flat-bred string which has spent much of the past six weeks sitting out the worst of the winter ground is now ready to emerge for the big spring Festivals. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about Cheltenham,\u201d Ferguson said on Friday, shortly after arriving in Australia from Dubai. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to take it easy because the ground has been so bad and I want to have horses that are fresh going to Cheltenham, so I haven\u2019t really run very many in the last six weeks. But we\u2019ve got a good team and I\u2019m excited about that and then, as far as Godolphin is concerned, I\u2019m very much enjoying the whole story.\u201d Ferguson has had just eight runners and a single winner in February but his yard is full of horses that were bred to win middle-distance Classics and his overall strike rate this season is 31%. When, or if, spring ground appears, his prolific early-season form is likely to return as well. Wolfcatcher, who lines up against several other useful juveniles in the Adonis Hurdle at Kempton, is a typically blue-blooded runner from the Ferguson stable, by King\u2019s Best out of a Sadler\u2019s Wells mare. He is quoted at 20-1 for the Fred Winter and bigger for the Triumph, though he could yet miss Cheltenham and head for Aintree instead. \u201cI worked him on Tuesday before I left and I was delighted with him,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cHe\u2019s the sort of horse that I\u2019m hoping will really be suited by some better ground at Kempton. He\u2019s done nothing wrong, he won at Market Rasen early in the season and then came back and got beaten by Dan Skelton\u2019s horse [Kasakh Noir]. He fluffed the second-last and I think if he\u2019d jumped that a bit better, he might have finished a short-head in front. He deserves to take his chance and we\u2019ll know a lot more about him afterwards. \u201cI\u2019ve also got Leoncavallo for the Triumph, who I\u2019m very happy with, and [the third-favourite] Jaleo for the Fred Winter, so we might decide to go for the Grade One juvenile at Aintree instead. The whole point of tomorrow is to decide which one of those three routes we are going to take.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s entries for the Festival also include Penglai Pavilion, who finished fifth in the 2013 Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe and took a valuable novice hurdle at Cheltenham earlier in the season. His best chance to saddle a Cheltenham Festival winner at the final attempt, however, could come in the Bumper, the target for the five-year-old High Bridge. Even by Ferguson\u2019s standards, High Bridge has a pedigree from the top drawer. He is by Monsun, an outstanding sire of stayers whose offspring include Estimate, the Queen\u2019s Ascot Gold Cup winner, and consecutive Melbourne Cup winners in Fiorente and Protectionist. His dam, meanwhile, was Ameerat, the winner of the 1,000 Guineas in 2001. High Bridge has not seen a track since December, when he thrashed two subsequent winners by 13 lengths in a bumper at Catterick. It was a hugely impressive success and it will be surprising if High Bridge does not start at a shorter price than the 20-1 which is still widely available. \u201cHe won very well at Catterick and since then he\u2019s thrived and thrived and thrived, and I\u2019ve purposely left him alone,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cI\u2019m not a betting man and I certainly won\u2019t be getting involved but I\u2019ve finished second in the Bumper with New Year\u2019s Eve and fifth with Purple Bay, so we have a pretty good idea of what\u2019s required. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that he\u2019s given me every indication that he can be a player, but we need good ground.

On the one hand, the popularity of British schools abroad is a triumph. The British (mostly English) companies running the schools earn good money and pump cash back into Treasury coffers. Their impressive reputation also demonstrates that an English education is seen as a \u201cgold standard\u201d around the world, with GCSEs and A-levels particularly saleable. So why is their popularity an inconvenience? Well, for every teacher heading to Saudi Arabia, there\u2019s a classroom in Skegness missing one. Last year, 18,000 more teachers left England for schools abroad, but just 17,000 new ones graduated through traditional university routes. Admittedly, not all of those going overseas trained or worked in the English state system, but it is a net loss of 1,000 people able and willing to work in our classrooms. Such a deficit might not be a problem if England wasn\u2019t in the midst of a chronic teacher shortage. But it is. A quirk in demography means that there are now lots of children aged under 10, but few adults in their early 20s (the typical cannon fodder of the profession). Add to this the baby-boom generation heading into retirement, the pull of beaches and tax-free salaries in Dubai, and you can see why there\u2019s a problem. Teacher vacancy rates are nine times as high as they were in 2011. The number of classes being temporarily covered by a supply teacher has tripled in a year. The flow isn\u2019t being stemmed: the government has failed to meet its teacher training targets for four years in a row and the figures are getting worse. Last year, just two in five design and technology teacher training places were taken. Religious education and art teacher courses are 40% empty. Wilshaw complains in his monthly missive that rule changes about overseas schools are making the problem worse. After formal training, teachers must meet on-the-job standards before they become fully qualified, but a recent tweak means that they can now do so while working abroad. This isn\u2019t fair, Wilshaw opines. Why should the \u201coffspring of overseas oligarchs\u201d benefit from UK-trained teachers while poor British children are left without? He asks: \u201cIs it unreasonable to ask someone who has been trained in our system to make a contractual commitment to teach in that same system for the first few years of their career?\u201d Yes, it is unreasonable. And here\u2019s why. First: it costs \u00a39,000 to train as a teacher. Some people get bursaries, some do on-the-job routes that are paid, but most get into debt to obtain a degree and their teaching qualification. After shelling out for their education, people (rightly) want to use it as they wish. Telling already-in-short-supply graduates that they must waive their right to travel is a surefire way to narrow recruitment further. Second: our classrooms benefit every year from thousands of teachers coming from abroad. Manifesto pledges such as increasing the number of Mandarin teachers depend on it. Picking off teachers from other countries while holding our own back would be hypocritical. Third, and most important: the loss of teachers abroad is only a tiny factor in England\u2019s overall recruitment crisis. The greater issue lies with the Conservatives\u2019 bizarre policies on pay and training, something that is also hitting home in other sectors such as healthcare. Wilshaw\u2019s suggestion of limiting new teachers\u2019 rights to work abroad is the equivalent of putting a whole class on detention for a huge mess that was actually created by their teacher. Teacher pay is rapidly diminishing in relation to other graduate jobs. The median wage among large graduate recruiters last year was \u00a329,500, according to the High Fliers Graduate Market Report 2015. Investment banking jobs start at an average \u00a345,000. Teaching, meanwhile, has an entry rate of \u00a323,000 outside London and an average of around \u00a326,000 in the capital. On top of this, since the introduction of pay restraint across the public sector, there are no guaranteed pay rises for each year of service. With rent prices spiralling, teachers in the south-east face paying 64% of their monthly salary to a landlord. Even if people were desperate to become teachers, many simply can\u2019t afford it. Improving the financial picture alone wouldn\u2019t help, though. Even if all financial incentives were pointing in the right direction, the government would still have the \u201cmy friend Jane\u201d problem, named after the time my mum called me a few weeks ago to tell me about her friend Jane, whose daughter is coming out of university. \u201cShe wants to be a teacher and I thought you could explain her options,\u201d said Mum. My heart sank. Driven by former education secretary Michael Gove\u2019s irrational hatred of university education departments, the government has reduced the number of university-led training places. To get a place, wannabe teachers are instead encouraged to apply to schools directly. What they offer \u2013 how much the training costs, their entry requirements, available bursaries \u2013 all differ and can feel bamboozling. Even with detailed knowledge of the system I couldn\u2019t easily tell Jane\u2019s daughter her best course of action. Compare the prospect of traipsing around schools, filling in 53 applications in the hope of landing a poorly paid job, to that of a slick graduate recruiter tempting you down one simple path to a lucrative career. Or, indeed, an international school recruiter offering a five-figure relocation package to exotic climes. Which one would you pick? Wilshaw was right about one thing: \u201cgolden handcuffs\u201d could be a solution, especially in the form of \u201cstudent loan forgiveness\u201d. With graduates so heavily in debt, a promise to pay off the loans of those in understaffed public sector professions \u2013 teaching, social work, probation \u2013 could drive more people to apply and wouldn\u2019t cost a great deal. Student loans are unlikely to be paid back by most people in such professions, so will be written off in the long term. Why not write them off now in return for three, five or seven years\u2019 service in the toughest jobs and the toughest parts of the UK? It seems a lot fairer \u2013 and a lot more likely to succeed \u2013 than telling people that if they train as a teacher they will have to stay at home.

Liam Payne, the once baby-faced member of One Direction, is reportedly in a \u201cblooming\u201d relationship with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, the singer who, five years ago, sat on the X Factor judging panel that catapulted him and his boyband to global stardom.  The romance seems to be the latest instalment of One Direction\u2019s \u201cboys to men\u201d saga, kickstarted by Zayn Malik\u2019s departure from the group last year to make music videos featuring more tastefully naked flesh than Simon Cowell ever allowed and closely followed by the revelation of Louis Tomlinson\u2019s lovechild.  Payne, 22, has allegedly been secretly dating Fernandez-Versini (formerly Cole/Tweedy), who is 32 and soon to be twice-divorced, since December when they reunited on X Factor. According to the Sun\u2019s extensive coverage, this secret liaison between British pop royalty has taken its toll not only on jealous One Direction fans but also the planet. A detailed map compiled by the newspaper traces the great lengths the pair went to to keep a \u201csteamy romantic getaway\u201d to a \u201clove island\u201d on Valentine\u2019s Day a secret from the prying eyes of the British press.  It appears that their clandestine but pollution-heavy routes to the Maldives (Barbados-New York-Dubai-Maldives for Fernandez-Versini and London-Maldives-Hong Kong\u2013LA for Payne) were all in vain, as a \u201cclose pal\u201d was willing to spill the beans on their cloak-and-dagger getaway to the tabloid press anyway. \u201cThey had an amazing trip and it really made them believe they had something special together,\u201d an unnamed and therefore totally convincing source told the Sun. \u201cBeing able to completely unwind away from the world\u2019s eye is not something that a member of the biggest boyband in the world and one of the UK\u2019s biggest style icons get to do often.\u201d Any suggestions that this relationship might just be a passing fling, as Fernandez-Versini distracts herself from that sticky divorce number two, have been put to rest by Payne\u2019s new hand tattoo.  The inked rose artwork on his hand appears to be a loving homage to the horticultural illustrations that adorn Fernandez-Versini\u2019s lower back and bottom, proving that Payne is indeed \u201cmadly in love\u201d with the singer, as \u201cclose pals\u201d have revealed.  The true depth of their feelings for each other was also made clear on Saturday night when the pair were apparently spotted strolling down the petfood aisle of a Guildford Tesco in the late hours.        Having once dated singer Leona Lewis, eight years his senior, in 2012, Payne is no stranger to dating high-profile singers. But for Fernandez-Versini, whose last husband was a smouldering French restaurateur who she is divorcing after 19 months, this relationship marks a notable change in taste.

Photograph: Liam Payne's Instagram/PA    Nonetheless, offering his showbiz oracle perspective on the romance, Sun reporter Dan Wootton seems highly confident this is, in fact, true love. \u201cAs someone who has known them both for years, it actually makes sense,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cThey are both genuine folk who never expected to find international super-stardom and have struggled to cope with many of the more difficult aspects of fame.\u201d", "title": "Liam Payne fuels rumours of romance with Cheryl Fernandez-Versini", "sentences": ["It appears that their clandestine but pollution-heavy routes to the Maldives (Barbados-New York-Dubai-Maldives for Fernandez-Versini and London-Maldives-Hong Kong\u2013LA for Payne) were all in vain, as a \u201cclose pal\u201d was willing to spill the beans on their cloak-and-dagger getaway to the tabloid press anyway."], "publicationDate": "2016-02-28T21:42:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/01/liam-plunkett-england-world-t20-the-spin", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Cricket", "World Twenty20", "Sport"], "article": "A long-distance relationship leads Liam Plunkett to spend much of his life away from cricket in Philadelphia and it was there, at 4.30am on Friday morning, where he received the text message that would see his winter plans change once again. The national selector, James Whitaker, was asking for a call back, in which he would confirm that Plunkett\u2019s fellow quick Steven Finn was to miss the upcoming World Twenty20 in India because of a left calf strain suffered on the road back from a left-side strain, and thus a seat on the plane was his. Plunkett was up and about already, yet to shake off jet lag from a trip to South Africa on which he had worked on his own fitness with the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s lead fast bowling coach, Kevin Shine, before staying on for another 10 days to join Yorkshire\u2019s stable of seamers in their pre-season camp in Potchefstroom. Air miles come with the territory for this 30-year-old, with his England career of late one of airports, suitcases, check-in times and boarding calls, often at the end of which he has found himself bowling in the nets, rather than the middle. The World Twenty20, he insists, will not be one of these occasions, believing his muscular brand of fast bowling to be potentially match-winning. \u201cI\u2019m not going out there just to sit in the squad,\u201d he . \u201cI\u2019m going out there to play and to bowl at my top pace. And why not? Why can\u2019t I go out and win games for England?\u201d That Plunkett is straining at the leash is understandable, with the ever-changing opinion of him among the selectors and one ill-timed, niggly injury of his own meaning he has been in and out of all three squads since the end of last summer, with only two Twenty20 appearances against Pakistan in Dubai last November to show for months on the road. Like his latest call-up, his chance only came through another\u2019s misfortune when, following an ankle injury to Mark Wood, he cancelled another trip to Philly to stay on in the United Arab Emirates, having already spent five weeks carrying drinks for the Test side.    I'm at the stage now where if I don\u2019t get picked, I will ask the question    But while the one-dayers came and went without a cap, the Twenty20 leg of the tour felt like a chance seized, as he touched 93mph on the speed gun when claiming back-to-back three-wicket hauls that helped England wrap up the series with a game to spare. That his name was not inked in for India at this stage baffled many, as did his subsequent exclusion from all three squads for the tour to South Africa. Plunkett would seek out the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, for answers as to why he was not part of the Test leg \u2013 the first squad named \u2013 having been leapfrogged by Chris Woakes, Mark Footitt and Chris Jordan. All three seamers had been behind him at the start of the United Arab Emirates trip, with no cricket played in the meantime to explain the rethink. \u201cHe said that\u2019s where they saw me in the pecking order; that Footitt offered variety as a left-armer, and I was behind the other two. I couldn\u2019t really come back with anything, because that\u2019s his opinion. Of course I feel like I\u2019m better than them but that\u2019s me saying it, isn\u2019t it? They would say they are better than me. That\u2019s cricket. \u201cSo while it was frustrating, you can\u2019t piss people off by reacting badly. With so much cricket coming up and injuries always possible, you don\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of people. But I am at the stage now where if I don\u2019t get picked, I will ask the question. In the past I might not have but now I\u2019ll ask. As long as you get feedback, that\u2019s all you\u00a0want.\u201d Injury has played its part in his winter of waiting too, with Plunkett finally having been called up for the limited-overs series against South Africa at the start of the year when Finn suffered his first knock, only to pull up with a thigh strain while playing for England Lions in Dubai just days before his flight. \u201cI feel what makes me bowl quick is my work ethic. But while I train hard, it also can be my downfall in terms of injuries,\u201d Plunkett explains. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to judge sometimes. I wouldn\u2019t take it away, though, because I feel like when I\u2019m going well and it all clicks, I\u2019m the quickest bowler in the country.\u201d Plunkett will touch down in India next week as not just the oldest member of the setup but also the most experienced in terms of years since debut, having first turned out for England in a Test in Lahore more than a decade ago, back when international cricket was still played in Pakistan and his team-mate Reece Topley was only 11. Then a raw 20-year-old stepping up to replace that summer\u2019s Ashes hero, Simon Jones, and fresh from claiming 51 wickets in Durham\u2019s promotion campaign that summer, Plunkett has since made only 50 appearances across the three formats. It is hard to think of an England cricketer whose cap to squad ratio is lower. \u201cIt can be frustrating; it would be nice to play more. There was a spell in there when I simply wasn\u2019t good enough but in the past few years I feel I have been bowling well enough to not just get in the squads but in the side and winning games. But you won\u2019t find me walking around with my bottom lip out.\u201d The fallow period he refers to came at the end of his time at Durham, when in the 2011 and 2012 seasons he slipped down to the second XI. A move to Yorkshire, working under Jason Gillespie, the head coach, and Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket, reinvigorated his game, bringing 42 first-class wickets at 25 runs apiece in his first season, which prompted a Test recall the following summer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you why I struggled; I guess I was confused about what type of bowler I was. Durham didn\u2019t pick me because I couldn\u2019t go at two runs an over but if someone asked me to do it now, I could, and still be hostile. But Yorkshire said they didn\u2019t want four of the same seam bowlers anyway. It\u2019s like the bullpen in baseball, with each of us having a different role. \u201cAnd I have full faith in Dizzy [Gillespie] and Frog [Moxon] and what they think I should do with my bowling. I remember one of my first sessions with them, I hit the side netting. Dizzy just turned to me and said: \u2018I couldn\u2019t give a shit mate, I just want you to bowl fast.\u2019 That stuck with me. \u201cWhen I was younger I used to worry before a big game about bowling a wide first up, but now I\u2019m thinking I can nick a bloke off. It\u2019s just a different way of looking at things.\u201dThis positive approach at Yorkshire, which Plunkett compares to the current England set-up under Bayliss and his assistant, Paul Farbrace, during our chat, is why he shrugs off the recent T20 losses to South Africa that have, along with Finn\u2019s injury, seen them turn from dark horses into outsiders in a number of the pre-tournament predictions. \u201cYou probably learn more in defeat than victory anyway,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe are not going to change how we\u2019ve played over the past year, and it\u2019s all about momentum in these tournaments, so there is no reason we can\u2019t go all the way.\u201d This week\u2019s Spin, a similarly late call-up because of the unavailability of the management\u2019s first choice, hopes to see the likeable Plunkett play a central role in this. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, our weekly cricket email.

On the middle of the 8th fairway, whence he had tossed a three-iron into water during a fit of pique last year, he laughed when going halfway towards re-enacting the scene. This time, putter was in hand; McIlroy had reached the green of the par five, his final hole, in two. The Dr Jekyll to Mr Hyde aspect of McIlroy\u2019s year to date was to follow. He three-putted, dumped a tee-shot into water when attacking a tricky, wind-affected pin on the short 9th and signed for a 71 which did not really replicate much of McIlroy\u2019s afternoon at all. Welcome to his 2016.   Related: Rory McIlroy puts faith in reverse putting grip as trump card in Miami    A new putting grip, with hands reversed, did not bring McIlroy the desired results. He used that club 33 times. McIlroy had promised to stick with this approach regardless of the first-round outcome at the WGC-Cadillac Championship and his stroke did look perfectly strong, but a frustration over conversion-to-chance ratio will only be natural. The trick will be in not letting that resonate fully. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny margins,\u201d McIlroy said of his finish. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing well you\u2019re sharp and you\u2019re really on your game, you don\u2019t make those mistakes. Right now, I\u2019m struggling with that part of the game. I just need to tidy it up.\u201d And the putting grip? \u201cIt felt good. If I had not have done what I did at the last there, I would have been coming off the golf course pretty happy.\u201d Jordan Spieth thereby claimed what bragging rights are available in such company, with McIlroy and Jason Day as playing partners. His 69 rather represented what makes the reigning Masters and US Open champion so formidable, given the regular whines and wails which accompanied Spieth\u2019s round. He still emerged three-under par with four fewer putts than McIlroy, not for the first time, a notable statistic. \u201cI would certainly sign up right now for three more rounds with the same score,\u201d Spieth admitted. \u201cI think we did a great job approaching this course like a major championship, giving it some respect, taking our medicine when we needed to and waiting for chances.\u201d Day appears to be a man still looking for fresh impetus following the life-changing experiences not only of a maiden major success \u2013 at the US PGA Championship last August \u2013 but the birth of his second child. The Australian\u2019s 72 was hardly the stuff of disaster but he has the talent to be doing more, particularly on a course such as this which suits his wonderful driving talent. \u201cRory played beautifully,\u201d said Day. \u201cHe is going to bounce back.\u201d Adam Scott, Day\u2019s compatriot, sits better off at four-under. Scott was triumphant at the Honda Classic last Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to really take it easy for a few days,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I feel good, the last couple of weeks has taken a lot out of me, so I\u2019m trying to conserve energy. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge sense of satisfaction for me in winning last week and it would be pretty easy to go and sit at home and feel good myself. But this is such a huge event and I\u2019m playing so well.\u201d This emergence of young blood seems to have further stirred the competitive juices of Phil Mickelson. The 45-year-old won this event back in 2009 and has aspirations of a repeat performance if an opening round of 67 is anything to go by. In 19 rounds this season, Mickelson has shot better than 70 a dozen times. Nine of those have been 68 or lower; a tally he only reached in mid-May during 2015. \u201cThe ball, the scorecard, they don\u2019t know my age,\u201d Mickelson smiled. Danny Willett\u2019s prominence is the further consequence of consistency. His recent win at the Dubai Desert Classic endorsed his status as the coming man of British golf. He signed for a 68 which at least had the impact of further displaying his talents to a broader audience. The Yorkshireman has finished inside the top three in two of his last three WGC appearances. \u201cIt was a good, solid day,\u201d he said. \u201cI hit 16 greens, had 30 putts; you can\u2019t really ask for much more around this golf course. Obviously I have started the season pretty well, fourth down in Sun City and winning in Dubai. This is only my fifth tournament of the year so it\u2019s nice to get a few good numbers on the board.\u201d Best of the day were Scott Piercy of the US on six-under and later matched by Marcus Fraser, though the Australian was looking good for the outright lead on the 18th only to find water and make bogey. Jamie Donaldson continued his fond alliance with Doral courtesy of a 70 while Jason Dufner\u2019s 68 included putts holed from 17ft, 19ft, 21ft, 35ft and 47ft.

They must begin to win the attention of the American sporting public \u2013 both TV viewers and, perhaps more importantly, striving young athletes. That is where Griffin and others come in. When it comes to the effect the Games can have on American youth rugby, most such operators agree with Don James, a former Eagles prop turned entrepreneur who will on Friday stage an awareness-raising event at Sam Boyd Stadium in Vegas, under the title \u201cRise of Rugby\u201d. \u201cRugby is the fastest-growing youth sport in America,\u201d James says, down the phone from San Francisco, citing a familiar statistic from the Sports &amp; Fitness Industry Association which says participation in US youth rugby grew by 81.6% from 2008 to 2013. James then cites a familiar view in rugby, bolstered by the same survey finding that in the same period youth participation in tackle football fell by 21%: \u201cWe need to seize that Olympic moment with parents who maybe don\u2019t want their kids playing football.\u201d Rugby, it should be said, has problems with head injuries too. But James continues: \u201cJust the fact that rugby is included is a game-changer. The US public are very keen on the Olympics, it brings exposure, funding from the government and other bodies too. This is the very tip of the iceberg for what that\u2019s going to mean.\u201d Griffin, after 10 years\u2019 work on the cracked asphalt of Queens and Manhattan now taking a big step through the CODP, puts the same point another way.    So what do we, in American rugby, make of this opportunity?  Mark Griffin, Play Rugby USA     \u201c[Olympic inclusion] makes the stakes so much bigger than ever. When you look at viewing figures on NBC for US rugby events recently, maybe a million watch every time. [Approximately] forty million people watch the Olympics in the US [on NBC Sports Network nightly]. This year, many of them will see some rugby sevens. For me, that makes for a massive \u2018so what?\u2019\u201d Griffin smiles, and spreads his hands. \u201cI mean that positively. So what do we, in American rugby, make of this opportunity?\u201d In his case, he will work with the official Northeast Academy to provide a pathway from inner-city, school or rugby club to elite Olympic competition. Rugby now has a foothold in America. Or, to stay with the dubious moutaineering analogies, potentially frightening exposure. The performance of the Eagles\u2019 men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams in Rio will help determine how fast and safe the climb can be. So will the many stakeholders of American rugby. In terms of developing the men and women who will play in Tokyo and beyond, governing body USA Rugby supervises, from Colorado, as a number of organisations seek out talent. There is also Tiger Rugby in Ohio and Atavus in Seattle, and more. The English are interested too: Premiership Rugby recently launched its Try Rugby USA programme, also in New York.

The former chief executive of Barclays has already established a banking operation in Africa through Atlas Mara, which is listed on the stock exchange and has a stock market value of about \u00a3250m. He created the business with Ashish Thakkar, a British national now based in Dubai.  If Diamond were to make an offer for the Barclays operations through Atlas Mara he would need to raise hundreds of millions of pounds and also find a way to unravel the complex Barclays operations in Africa, which could prove to be extremely difficult. Speculation about Diamond\u2019s interest in buying up some of the operations owned by his former employer have been rife after Barclays confirmed this week that it intended to scale back on the continent as a part of an effort by its new chief executive, Jes Staley, to simplify the business and preserve capital.  The Financial Times reported (\u00a3) that Diamond could seek backing from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East or Asia to support any bid and calculated that the value of the Barclays operations outside South Africa that could fit with the Altas Mara business were valued at \u00a31.5bn. Staley wants to reduce Barclays\u2019 62.3% stake in its African business, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange. Barclays made a big push back into South Africa 10 years ago when it bought a 60% stake in local bank Absa. The business has now become Barclays Africa Group Limited, which is listed on the stock market and holds most of the bank\u2019s operations in Africa. Barclays has admitted it could take two to three years to reduce its presence in Africa, which generates about 20% of the bank\u2019s profits and is prepared to hold a smaller stake in the Johannesburg-listed business. It did not elaborate on its statement from Tuesday when it announced its profits had fallen 8% to \u00a32.1bn in 2015 and warned it was more than halving its dividend for this year and next.

They will be especially pleased if Leon Smith decides to play him alongside his brother, Jamie, in place of Dominic Inglot in the doubles on Saturday against Yoshihito Nishioka and Yasutaka Uchiyama - as the team captain hinted strongly at the end of day one, with the match one apiece. Smith expects Japan to change their team to accommodate their best player, the world No 6, Kei Nishikori, so the natural response would be to field the Murray brothers ahead of the reverse singles . \u201cIt depends on how Andy feels,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt would be great if he can play, and Andy and Jamie are our strongest team \u2013 but the good thing is, even if he doesn\u2019t want to play, we\u2019ve got a good guy in Dom. I\u2019m quite relaxed about it. Dom is used to it. It\u2019s team sport and he knows it\u2019s a huge privilege to be part of this team.\u201d The focus, however, remains on the world No2, as it always has done and as it always will. He was satisfied with his first competitive match since the final of the Australian Open nearly five weeks ago, serving near his best and moving well, to beat the world No87, Taro Daniel, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1. \u201cI thought I did a lot of things well,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI maybe made a few bad decisions out there and my concentration could have been a little bit better at times but, for a first match in five weeks in that sort of atmosphere against a guy who obviously makes a lot of balls, it was OK.\u201d   Related: Andy Murray quietly dismantles Taro Daniel in Davis Cup opener    He denied his mind had wandered to thoughts of his new daughter, Sophia, and explained his lapses arrived because he had been too intent beforehand not to let an early lead distract him. It was a very Murrayesque explanation but it sort of made sense. In the second singles, Dan Evans provided plenty of quality \u2013 some of his winners were sublime and unreachable \u2013 but not enough consistency or, on occasion, judgment, which gave Nishikori enough opportunities to win 6-3, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3) in two hours and 43 minutes of gripping tennis. Evans is one of those gifted players who is capable of losing too often when playing well. Nishikori, the world No6, was worth his win but Evans, ranked 157 and rising, pushed Nishkori harder than the score indicates. Japan\u2019s finest player by a distance, Nishikori looked tired and not a little rattled after blowing match point to hand Evans a tie-break chance in the third, but the local hero\u2019s arms finally grew weary, and a concluding forehand drifted into the tramlines. Evans \u2013 who beat Nishikori in their only previous meeting, at the US Open four years ago \u2013 saved 12 break points but blew nine of 13 chances, as well as handing his opponent the second set with a double fault. However, Murray reckons Evans has the beating of Daniel, if the tie comes down to the final singles on Sunday. \u201cI think Dan has a good chance to win that,\u201d Murray said. \u201cLast night I watched a match they played against each other in Vancouver last year. Daniel was up 5-0 in the third and Dan managed to come back and win that one 7-6. Mentally that will be still in the back of his head, and a little bit on Sunday. \u201cDan\u2019s capable of winning that match. When he plays well, he\u2019s a very, very tough guy to win against. He\u2019s got a game style that Daniel won\u2019t like. There\u2019s a lot of variety, plays a different sort of game, comes to the net, doesn\u2019t give you much rhythm. I think it\u2019s a good match-up for Dan.\u201d The winner of this first-round meeting will play either Serbia away or Kazakhstan at home the week after Wimbledon. On day one of that tie in Belgrade, Novak Djokovic looked to have recovered completely from the eye problem that forced his retirement in Dubai last month, as he comprehensively outgunned Aleksandr Nedovyesov 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. Later, Mikhail Kukushkin shocked Viktor Troicki to win 7-5, 6-2, 6-4 and level the tie. If Murray has recovered well \u2013 and there is no reason an hour-and-a-half match should have inconvenienced him much \u2013 he ought to be in a position to secure this weekend\u2019s tie in the first reverse singles on Sunday, against Nishikori. \u201cI kept a lot of points short,\u201d he said of his win over Daniel. The Japanese reflected the anxiety and frustration a lot of lesser players experience when confronting someone as accomplished and patient as Murray. Daniel said: \u201cI sometimes wished he played a little bit better; he was sometimes just hitting the ball back, hitting the ball back \u2013 so I was rushing it.\u201d That is a measure of Murray\u2019s tennis intelligence; he was grinding when appropriate, yet went for a lot of free points too, with 15 aces and 19 clean winners. It was a level Daniel, who is physically slight, could never cope with. Still, the Japanese No2 played enough attractive tennis to give the 9,000 fans their money\u2019s worth in an arena perfectly suited to the occasion: compact and noisy, with excellent views from every seat. There did not appear to be many Japanese supporters there to give their players much encouragement, making this a fairly chastening experience for Daniel, who strayed into the lion\u2019s den on just the wrong day. There was a remarkable comeback to tennis for Finland\u2019s Jarkko Nieminen, who beat Zimbabwe\u2019s Courtney John Lock, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, in their opening rubber of the Group II Europe/Africa tie.

In the news pages, victim support groups were asking increasingly fierce questions about why the \u00a310m winger was allowed to play for Sunderland after being arrested, earning \u00a33m in the process, despite the club\u2019s chief executive, Margaret Byrne, having been fully briefed by police and shown 834 WhatsApp messages exchanged between Johnson and his 15-year-old victim.  On the back pages, executives from the country\u2019s biggest clubs had been photographed leaving a secret summit with representatives from a US sports marketing giant, at which they discussed ways in which they could make even more money from potentially revamping the Champions League. Meanwhile the prime minister insisted that he felt the pain of ordinary fans protesting over ticket prices in the light of the Premier League\u2019s \u00a38.3bn broadcasting deal. These three loosely connected strands coalesced by the end of the week into a familiar feeling that football has long slipped its moral moorings, even as its commercial value and the wages of its star players soar.     Adam Johnson arriving at Peterlee magistrates court with Stacey Flounders last May. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Rex/Shutterstock    The details of the Johnson case illuminated a world in which talented players are plucked from school and paid huge sums from an early age, often well before they break into the first team.  Over two days in the witness box at Bradford crown court, Johnson painted his fellow players as a bunch of pampered millionaires who, when not playing football or partying in Las Vegas, Los Angeles or Dubai, were glued endlessly to their smartphones. He was candid when asked how football had affected his maturity. \u201cIt slowed it down,\u201d he said, adding that he had become arrogant and acted without integrity towards his partner, Stacey Flounders, and their baby daughter. It was the monotony of life as a Premier League footballer, he claimed, that caused him to \u201cget caught up\u201d in sending sexually charged messages to a series of women \u2013 and the 15-year-old girl \u2013 behind his partner\u2019s back. \u201cYou\u2019re bored and you get caught up in texting just to keep yourself busy,\u201d he explained, when asked about the hundreds of messages he sent to the teenager, mostly from a hotel room the night before a match or while waiting for the team coach to depart Sunderland\u2019s Stadium of Light. Never mind the glamorous partner, the newborn baby and the \u00a31.85m mansion \u2013 it was all, it seemed, to add a bit of spice to the daily tedium of life as a \u00a360,000-a-week Premier League footballer. Jon Holmes, the former football agent whose clients included Gary Lineker and David Beckham, believes the way the dynamic has shifted between players, their advisers and their clubs as wages have risen exponentially in the Premier League era is a factor. \u201cThe problem now is that if the agents do anything to upset them, they get the sack. They get someone else to feed their ego,\u201d said Holmes, also a former chairman of Leicester City. \u201cThey are more glorified concierges than advisers. There are so many people hanging on to the gravy train that nobody wants to upset it.\u201d One former neighbour in Grants Houses, the mining village on the east Durham coast where Johnson honed the skills that would later make him a multimillionaire, said the 28-year-old had never had to grow up. \u201cAdam never had a normal adult life. He was a footballer when he was still a boy and he never learned how to become a man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had everything done for him and he had too much money at too young an age. I think it made him believe he could do whatever he wanted without having to face up to it.\u201d   Related: Sunderland and PFA must stop avoiding questions over Adam Johnson case    Club press officers tell tales of hours spent trying to keep kiss-and-tell stories out of newspapers. The concentric circles of hangers-on that surround their players often overlap with criminal elements, and the challenge of policing players perennially glued to WhatsApp or Snapchat is considerable. In Sunderland\u2019s training ground canteen, Johnson said, every player would stare at their smartphones, swap texts and make small talk to pass the time. He claimed that before one training session, the squad of 30 players discussed a documentary on underage marriage. It was this conversation, he claimed, that prompted him to Google \u201clegal age of consent\u201d four days after his illegal sexual activity with the victim in his car.  Clubs are under huge competitive pressure to sign the brightest talent from the age of seven upwards and keep their young charges and their parents happy. Perhaps that is one reason why, despite employing child welfare officers and increasingly delivering lifestyle courses, they tend to default to protecting their \u201casset\u201d when crisis hits. From John Terry\u2019s on-field racism and Jose Mourinho\u2019s treatment of club doctor Eva Carneiro at Chelsea, to Liverpool\u2019s determination to defend Luis Su\u00e1rez over racism charges and the furore over Oldham Athletic\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to sign the convicted rapist Ched Evans, a depressing trend has emerged.

Photograph: North Wales police/PA    Namely, that clubs are keen to promote their community schemes and champion diversity when it suits them, but mislay their moral compass when it comes to the bottom line and results on the pitch. It is one in which fans are sometimes complicit: Johnson\u2019s and Evans\u2019s victims were both hounded on social media. \u201cFootball fans themselves should take a look at this and let justice take its course. That poor young woman has been through an awful lot. She has had her life torn apart by this. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d said shadow sports minister Clive Efford. He called on the Football Association to develop a clear set of guidelines for clubs that, like professions such as teaching, would see players suspended if they were accused of serious offences.  In the wake of the outcry over an attempted return to football by Evans, whose appeal to the criminal cases review board will be heard later this month, both the FA and the Football League promised reviews of the issues around footballers and serious sexual offences. But nothing more has been heard. \u201cIt became a talking shop for doing nothing,\u201d said Efford.  Meanwhile the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) acknowledged that it could play more of a role in educating young players. \u201cThe PFA has developed over a period of time a training programme incorporating the theme of personal integrity for all professional players, ensuring they are fully informed on such issues. It includes sexual consent, standards of behaviour and respectful relationships in person and on social media,\u201d it said. \u201cSituations such as this, unfortunately, demonstrate that this is a vital area for our focus and that there is still much work to do.\u201d    Related: We can only hope that football learns from the sordid Adam Johnson case | Archie Bland    Rick Parry, the former Liverpool FC and Premier League chief executive, argues there is only so much the clubs themselves can achieve.  \u201cWe were very aware of it and took it very seriously, through club chaplaincy and an education officer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some kids for whom football is their saviour and there were others where you did everything you conceivably could, but at the end of the day you can\u2019t change them.\u201d ", "title": "Adam Johnson coverage shows football has slipped its moral moorings", "sentences": ["Over two days in the witness box at Bradford crown court, Johnson painted his fellow players as a bunch of pampered millionaires who, when not playing football or partying in Las Vegas, Los Angeles or Dubai, were glued endlessly to their smartphones."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-04T23:49:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/05/the-agenda-adcock-rio-alberto-contador-paris-nice", "tags": ["Badminton", "Cycling", "MLS", "Sport", "US sports", "Football", "Tennis"], "article": "BADMINTON CHAMPS ...

McCartney acknowledges applause from the audience. Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images    The latest financial results for McCartney\u2019s brand, for the year ending 2014, saw profits in the UK rise by 22.7%. So, for her autumn/winter 2016 collection, the designer took something of a greatest hits approach, touching on all the things her customers buy season after season: trouser suits, oversized coats, cosy chic knitwear and the kind of evening wear that does not require three hours in hair and makeup.  If that sounds boring, it wasn\u2019t. This was one of the strongest McCartney collections in recent seasons. The midnight blue velvet trouser suit with tulle inset across the shoulders was a lovely conceit, as were rust-coloured slip dresses with long pleated metallic skirts. High-waisted flared trousers, a bleached denim shirt dress and juicy puffa gilets had an easy coolness that McCartney could patent. Jumpers with frilled edges and a swan print played into a sort of retro whimsy currently in vogue.      Frilled edges showcased an effortless coolness.

This was a modern collection, sympathetic to how most women live now.  Perhaps this could be put down to McCartney\u2019s continual ability to translate her own lifestyle as a mother and businesswoman into the clothes she creates. She said as much backstage \u2013 the effortless evening wear was down to her interest in \u201cday to night\u201d. She added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to change.\u201d     Paul McCartney among his daughter\u2019s front row \u2018squad\u2019.

She will design the Adidas kit for Team GB to wear at the Rio Olympics in June; replicas of her London 2012 kit were the most successful ever for the brand.  It has been suggested that the designer\u2019s next project will be to expand to menswear, with the first collection for spring 2017. No wonder the latest collection was a celebration, as the designer noted backstage, of what defines the Stella McCartney brand.      A Stella McCartney model in a whimsical swan-print dress.

There were parkas, sweaters with holes in odd places and a colour palette in the shades of school uniforms: bottle green, claret and navy.  Some pieces \u2013 belted cropped shearling jackets and printed pleated midi skirts \u2013 would no doubt please the fans in the audience, but devor\u00e9 velvet and parkas embroidered with patches usually found on school blazers felt a bit fussy.

I have been away from the court for five weeks. I don\u2019t know if it is meant to be, but that sounds like a very strange question.\u201d He will be there for as long as this fight takes. And what of the Serb? He has shown physical frailty the past few weeks, quitting during a match in Dubai with an eye problem and nursing a sore shoulder through the tightest of wins against Kazakhstan last weekend. Djokovic has yet to commit, and it could be that he will prioritise the Olympics in Rio in August, although it would not be a great look in his hometown, where nationalism is frighteningly intense, if he were to leave an otherwise underpowered squad to fend for themselves against the defending champions. There are murmurs the Serbs are considering staging the tie outdoors in the capital, which would not only put extra pressure on Djokovic to play, but lend lustre to a dream showdown between the No1 and No2 players in the ATP rankings. Djokovic, after all, has a 22-9 career record against Murray, 11 of those arriving in their past 12 matches. It is a dominance that would crush a lesser player than the Scot, but the man who knows him better than anyone outside his family, Leon Smith, the Great Britain captain, does not see it that way. \u201cAndy can beat anyone \u2013 including Novak,\u201d he says, reflecting on the fact Murray\u2019s two slam titles have come in finals against the Serb. \u201cAnd Davis Cup is different. You see that with Novak [who credits leading Serbia to their only cup, in 2010, as the turning point of his career]. You see that with performances like the one Kei put out here. He got really close to Andy. You have got your team-mates on the side of the court. You have got home and away support. Look at Novak\u2019s match in Belgrade [where Mikhail Kukushkinmight have won had he not faded only in the final set], it is never straightforward, is it? It is an amazing competition. Funny things happen.\u201d   Related: Maria Sharapova announces she failed a drugs test at Australian Open    Smith might have an unexpected ace. Aljaz Bedene, the Slovenia-born world No51 who trained with the squad all last week, goes before an eligibility panel of the International Tennis Federation in Moldova on 20 March. If he wins his appeal he could figure in selection for Belgrade \u2013 which would please Smith and the nation, but might be a blow to his rivals for a singles place alongside Murray: Dan Evans, Kyle Edmund and James Ward. Smith said: \u201cIf he becomes available, it\u2019s another high-quality player that we\u2019ve got at our disposal \u2013 not that he would necessarily come into the team, of course, because there\u2019s a bit of time before the next tie. But he\u2019s going to be a great addition to our squad, which is already really strong. Fingers crossed it goes his way.\u201d If he is being kind to the rest of the squad, it is understandable. They are a tight-knit unit, and Smith will be watching their progress across the globe this week. \u201cJames is playing a Puebla Challenger, Kyle has squeaked into the Indian Wells main draw, which is great. Aljaz has too. Andy leaves for Indian Wells [on Monday], as do Jamie [Murray] and Dom [Inglot]. Evo [Evans] leaves for the Drummondsville Challenger on Wednesday.\u201d On Sunday the titans prevailed. They nearly always do, whatever the struggle.

Less, than seven years ago, I remember him having his first ride in Britain, on one of his father\u2019s outsiders at Royal Ascot. He had a good reputation but it wasn\u2019t easy to look at this lanky kid finishing second-last in a handicap and imagine enormous success to come. He went on to win all the colts\u2019 Classics in Britain, including two Derbys in a three-year span, added six Irish Classics, enormously valuable races in the US and Dubai and was the Irish champion jockey twice. And now he\u2019s stopped after an unequal battle with the scales to become a trainer. Yes, he had opportunities to die for and there were one or two notable mistakes along the way but he moulded himself into an effective jockey at the highest level in a short time and it seems to me that he doesn\u2019t get quite enough credit in Britain for his achievements in the saddle. Anyway, his next career will surely be longer.   Related: Horse racing tips: Tuesday 8 March    Nicholascopernicus (3.50) is the day\u2019s nap at Newcastle, where the seven-year-old is on offer at 11-8. He won four races on the Flat for Ed Walker, including twice off marks in the 80s. Most unusually, he was still with Walker when having three spins in maiden hurdles last season; indeed, he has been Walker\u2019s only runner over jumps. It might not, therefore, be entirely surprising that he made no impression in those hurdle contests but he now starts in handicap hurdles off what should be a very manageable mark of 104, if he can translate a bit more of his Flat ability to this sphere. It can only help in that regard that he is now with Kerry Lee and wears a tongue tie for only the second time. Continuing the theme of switching stables, Generous Pet (2.10) may be worth a look at 8-1 for the opener, a handicap hurdle for conditional riders. This seven-year-old didn\u2019t do much in a handful of runs for Kevin Bishop but showed some ability in points and is now with Kenneth Slack, who is having a good season and has sometimes been able to improve new recruits.

On one hand, they want to make art speaking to universal issues. On the other, the market may expect their work to reflect a homeland where they no longer live.  As the country\u2019s geopolitical isolation grew after the 1979 Revolution, Iranian art became sought after by European or American art buyers seeking to enhance their worldly image as collectors. They wanted pieces that would appear Iranian to someone who had never been to the country.  The image of a struggling Iranian artist making work about his tough life makes for \u201ca sexy story,\u201d explains Iranian-American artist Amir Fallah. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for [collectors]. They have been doing that with African-American artists for decades. I\u2019ve tried to resist it as much as I can.\u201d  Some artists navigate this dichotomy well, securing their place on the world art scene. Last year three major museums on the east coast of the United States held exhibitions of Iranian artists. Shirin Neshat had her retrospective at the Hirsh Horn Museum in Washington DC. Parviz Tanavoli\u2019s sculptures were displayed at Wellesley College in Boston. Monir Farman Farmaian had a solo show at the Guggenheim in New York.  These and other artists face a market that expects their work to reflect today\u2019s Iran. It is difficult to identify the degree to which any of the emigre artists profiled below conform to these expectations. But all of them admit to grappling at some point with the issue as artists with an Iranian past. Nicky Nodjoumi, New York, NY The surreal paintings of Nodjoumi (pictured above), who left Iran in 1980, have sociopolitical themes. A recurring element in his work is the figure of the businessman, portrayed as a conspiring praetor: \u201cThe problem now about working in the US is that you are faced with this duality, with this dilemma. Either you are truly an artist without the notion of being from Iran; but at the same time if you are Iranian you have to show some symbol of identity in order to be accepted in the art scene. Not as a universal artist but as an Iranian artist.\u201d     Shirin Neshat Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Shirin Neshat, New York, NY Neshat is considered a pioneer of a new kind of oriental art for her famous depictions of Iranian women. Critics of her work say she caters to western views by promoting a clich\u00e9d image of Iran. Neshat has been outspoken against the Iranian government\u2019s policies towards artists and women, but rejects the responsibility of talking on behalf of the women of an entire country: \u201cI\u2019m not an ambassador of the Iranian society, the people of Iran, or the Muslim world. This is about one single person\u2019s perspective who\u2019s lived abroad whose point of view has been shaped by her own experiences, and here it is. This is my point of view, this is what it is, and I take responsibility for this one single thing.\u201d      Bizan Bassiri Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Bizan Bassiri, Rome, Italy Bassiri moved to Rome in his twenties to go to art school. His life as an artist changed when he took a walk on the crater of Mount Vesuvius with a classmate. The strength and power of the volcano has inspired his sculptures ever since. In the art world, Bassiri is recognized as a sculptor who has completely avoided the Iranian label. Speaking Italian with a slight accent, Bassiri sees Iran as a remote past:  \u201cWhen you are on the path of art, you can only move forward, purify yourself and grow in that [process]. You cannot stop a second to look back.\u201d     Taravat Talepasand Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Taravat Talepasand, San Francisco, California Born in Oregon to Iranian parents, Talepasand expresses the displacement of being an Iranian woman living in America. With politically charged titles like: \u201cWestoxicated\u201d or \u201cThe corrupt minority,\u201d Talepasand\u2019s miniatures project the image of an Iranian-American woman who flaunts sexual freedom and independence: \u201cI never used that Iranian card to get into shows but I do think it has piqued people\u2019s interest in my work that I am an Iranian woman living in the United States and there is nudity in the work.\u201d     Fereydoun Ave Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Fereydoun Ave, Paris, France An artist, curator and collector, Ave has lived in the United States, Iran and France. He saw the Iranian art scene grow under Empress Farah Diba Pahlavi\u2019s patronage in the 1970s and witnessed the global art market gaining ground among Iranian artists. A western taste in art has monopolized the Iranian art market since 2006, when Sothebys and Christies opened in Dubai, he says:  \u201cThe big change came when Dubai became Dubai. In other words, the crossroads where western companies and countries could meet eastern countries and companies on no man\u2019s land.\u201d      Taraneh Hemami Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Taraneh Hemami, San Francisco, California Despite living in California for over thirty years, Hemami focuses on modern Iranian history in her work. In her sculptures and paintings, she alludes to elements of Iranian political propaganda. After curating an exhibition of works by Iranian artists living in the San Francisco Bay area, she realized that galleries, as well as the media, were interested in a certain kind of Iranian art: \u201cThere were over thirty Iranian artists in the show and two of the works had women in veils. We had several journalists who were interested in doing newspaper features about the exhibition. Every single one wanted images of those two works.\u201d      Y Z Kami Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Y Z Kami, New York, NY Since his early New York shows in the late 1980s, Kami has been focusing on portraiture. From the beginning of his career, he has approached his craft without clearly referring to his Iranian heritage: \u201cThe role of an artist is be true to himself and mirror whatever view he has of the world. Artists from Middle East who focus on political work have been very successful with galleries and the art market.\u201d     Mitra Fabian Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Mitra Fabian, Santa Cruz, California Mitra Fabian is a sculptor and installation artist working almost exclusively with manufactured materials: the leftovers, the by-products, the remnants of human industry:  \u201cSome people that I\u2019ve worked with wished it would come through a bit more [that I am Iranian]. It\u2019s sexier if you can have a cultural concept coming through in your work that\u2019s non-American in America. I think that\u2019s kind of a hot sell.\u201d     Babak Golkar Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Babak Golkar, Vancouver, Canada Golkar was born in Berkeley, California but spent his formative years in Tehran. Though he doesn\u2019t consider himself a political artist, his practice is informed by politics. Retaining aspects of nomadic culture in his work, he says that many collectors and gallery owners see his works as specifically from Iran. This is contrary to his aims of producing nomadic art that transcends geographical borders: \u201cIt has a lot of benefits for artists to be labeled Iranian...I am not opposed to that approach. People have to make a living. We live in a capitalistic society. However, I don\u2019t sit in the studio and think, oh I\u2019ll make this carpet because it\u2019s going to sell.\u201d     Amir Fallah Photograph: Matteo Lonardi    Amir H Fallah, Los Angeles, California Fallah was born in Tehran and raised in Fairfax, Virginia. After graduating college, he says it was clear that branding himself as an Iranian artist could have helped him financially. But he resisted.  \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for [collectors] - \u2018oh, you know Iranian artist making work about such a tough life he\u2019s had\u2019. It\u2019s a sexy story.

Notable juncture No2 arrived in Dubai a matter of weeks later; this time with regards to the impression Pelley made on those flag-bearing European golfers who ply their trade primarily in the United States. In China, Pelley was clearly the outstanding performer on a forum stage which included Finchem and the R&amp;A\u2019s Martin Slumbers. The Canadian brings dynamism and energy to any environment, as witnessed by players, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose among them. They left Dubai breakfast meetings waxing lyrical about Pelley\u2019s plans.   Related: PGA Tour chief says golf should be controlled by one organisation    Pelley\u2019s enthusiasm is highly infectious. Professionally, he has entered the world of golf with the aim of questioning all that has gone before and all that may happen in the future. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that in the past,\u201d will never be an excuse against transition. It is hardly a leap of faith to suggest the PGA Tour is not entirely sure how to handle, or respond to, fresh circumstances across the Atlantic. That much was evidenced again on Sunday as Finchem raised the possibility of one all-encompassing brand to control professional golf in both the US and Europe. Needless to say, Finchem \u2013 who is not even expected to remain in office for much longer \u2013 does not have aspirations of watering down his own organisation; this looked an attempt to suggest the European Tour should stand aside. If it was a deliberate jab towards Pelley, suffice to say it has not worked. The message from Wentworth is one of full steam ahead. \u201cFrom my perspective, we are and will always be a members\u2019 organisation,\u201d Pelley told the Guardian. \u201cEvery decision we make, every thing we are involved in, we will always deal with the members first and foremost. If in fact there was a significant advantage to our members, to our players and this saw increased prize funds, increased playing opportunities, then I would imagine our members would want us to explore that. But I have not had a conversation with any of our members to date as such. \u201cI have only been in this job seven months, I am still listening and learning and what I have learnt is that we have a diversity that is very much our strength. We are golf\u2019s global tour; we play in 26 countries in five continents of the world, including the United States. We have quite a bit of diversity right now and what we are currently trying to do is build our organisation and build our tour for our members. Obviously, Mr Finchem has been in the industry a lot longer than I have so he is probably better equipped to talk about it but every decision we make will always be with our members at the forefront.\u201d Pressed on whether or not a combined tour would automatically make commercial sense, as Finchem intimated, Pelley added: \u201cI think golf is a little bit different to other sports, based on how many tours there are. We are obviously working with quite a few tours, we have sanctioned events with a number of organisations. Whether a consolidated tour is advantageous is something that would require significant exploration from all the tours and I\u2019m not sure that is something that would happen overnight. \u201cBased on the fact you already have tours fully operational, I don\u2019t think it is as simple as saying just: \u2018Let\u2019s all come together and it will be commercially viable.\u2019 You have to look at it from every member\u2019s perspective, that being the top-ranked player to the 200th. If there was a significant benefit to our members, it is something we would look at but it is not something we have explored to this point.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe we are already a global tour, with the diversity, the number of countries, where our members play. For us, we are in the process of making our tour a viable alternative to the tour in the United States. To do that, we will have to be aggressive. \u201cI think the PGA Tour have a very well-run, sophisticated business. I think they have done a terrific job. My focus is not on necessarily what transpires in the US but how we can provide significant playing benefits and opportunities, increased prize purses, for our members. Doing such and increasing the golf experience for our members is critical as we try to have our players play more on our tour.\u201d As Pelley will be acutely aware, talking the talk is one thing; delivering results is what will determine his European Tour legacy. For all he has breathed fresh life into an organisation which, being blunt, seemed guilty of laziness in the past, there will be onlookers who hope his grand plans are undermined by the harsh competition of this sponsorship world. \u201cChange is not going to happen overnight but it will happen,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThis is kind of our transitional year. I believe our tour will look different in 2017 and 2018. In terms of coming together as a consolidated tour, I wouldn\u2019t begin to entertain that without the players at the forefront of every single discussion. \u201cWe have already seen the Italian Open [purse] change, it will go to \u20ac7m next year. If this is a transitional year, 2017 will be different in terms of our prize purses, 2018 will grow upon that. I believe we have tremendous opportunity to show growth to our players.\u201d That means delving into markets not traditionally encountered by European golf. \u201cWe are in the midst of rebuilding our commercial value for our potential and current partners,\u201d Pelley said. \u201cGolf provides some opportunities that other sports don\u2019t. First and foremost, an ability to potentially play with guys in a pro-am or walk inside the ropes during the live rounds. That doesn\u2019t happen elsewhere \u2026 you are not on the pitch, you are not on the court in other sports. Partners and players, bringing them together, is a critical strategy for us.\u201d Talk of mergers, takeovers and the like is not.", "title": "European golf chief on US merger idea: \u2018I believe we are already a global tour\u2019 | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["Notable juncture No2 arrived in Dubai a matter of weeks later; this time with regards to the impression Pelley made on those flag-bearing European golfers who ply their trade primarily in the United States.", "They left Dubai breakfast meetings waxing lyrical about Pelley\u2019s plans."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-09T15:44:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/09/ofsted-chief-criticises-independent-schools-lack-of-help-for-state-schools", "tags": ["Private schools", "Schools", "Ofsted", "Education", "UK news", "Academies", "Free schools"], "article": "Independent schools should lose their charitable status unless they volunteer to run state academies, the UK\u2019s chief schools inspector has said, warning that the reluctance of private schools to help educate poor children is a moral outrage.

He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a way of meeting the demands of the Charity Commission and not much else.\u201d \u201cI say this, really, in a sense of moral outrage, that they are opening up all these independent schools in Dubai and the Middle East and elsewhere \u2013 sucking in more of our teachers, who aren\u2019t going to Derby or Northampton or Grimsby or Hull, but going off to an independent school sponsored by the big public schools over here. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of moral outrage that they not doing enough for our own poor children.\u201d Private schools qualify for charitable status because of their educational mission, which some critics say is inappropriate for institutions charging around \u00a330,000 for a boarding school place.   Related: Ofsted boss clashes with private school heads over 'deep pockets' remark    But Wilshaw\u2019s comments were rejected as \u201cutter nonsense\u201d by John Claughton, headteacher of King Edward\u2019s school, Birmingham, who was present at the conference. Claughton said his school worked with nearly 200 state primary schools in Birmingham, and last year alone spent \u00a32m on means-tested scholarships, with 100 of the school\u2019s 850 pupils receiving a full rebate of the \u00a312,000 fee and a further 100 benefiting from financial assistance. \u201cTo say that we do nothing for our community is disgraceful. Accusing independent schools of stealing all the state school teachers is extraordinary,\u201d Claughton said. Wilshaw has been a frequent critic of the independent sector\u2019s lack of involvement in sponsoring academies or free schools, although a number of leading private schools such as Eton and Manchester Grammar school have done so. \u201cIt\u2019s small potatoes, really, those bursaries. The independent sector would have much more impact if they allied themselves \u2013 as one or two do \u2013 with local schools to improve those schools\u2019 performance,\u201d Wilshaw told the conference. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, told the conference that teacher recruitment by independent schools was a big issue at a time of severe shortages in the state sector. Wilshaw added that teachers were \u201ctrained by the taxpayer, and then to go off into the independent sector seems wrong. I just think we need to worry about this. \u201cIf the independent sector is going to have all these privileges, then they should put something back.\u201d But Wilshaw\u2019s claim that \u201cthe independent sector is expanding exponentially abroad and taking our teachers\u201d was disputed by the Independent Schools Council. Julie Robinson, the ISC\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe truth is, there are just 44 schools set up abroad by ISC schools and between them they do not employ large numbers of UK-trained teachers. \u201cIt therefore seems wrong to state, as Mr Wilshaw has, that this is the cause of teacher shortages in this country and we see no reason why independent schools setting up international campuses should be a problem.\u201d   Related: UK schools suffering as newly qualified teachers 'flock abroad'    Wilshaw has previously said that he recruited teachers from abroad \u2013 including from Ireland \u2013 when he was head teacher in state secondary schools in London. Chris King, chair of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference of public schools and head of Leicester Grammar School, said Wilshaw\u2019s \u201csimplistic, adversarial approach\u201d did not stand up to scrutiny. \u201cSome independent schools already successfully sponsor academies but not all independent schools have the resources, expertise or personnel to do so,\u201d King said. \u201cPerhaps it would be more productive to find ways of improving state education, which many independent schools are already doing through successful and unsung partnerships.\u201d Earlier, Wilshaw criticised state secondary schools, and claimed that many new teachers were leaving the profession because of \u201cpoor culture in the schools they are going into and poor behaviour ... and what they see as poor leadership\u201d. \u201cSomething is going wrong in our secondary schools,\u201d Wilshaw said, pointing out the persistent gap in attainment between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. \u201cIf you are going to improve social mobility, our secondary school performance is going to have to radically improve.\u201d The Department for Education rejected Wilshaw\u2019s comments, saying that state schools are \u201cincreasingly matching the private sector\u201d in performance.\u201cThe assumption that state schools need to learn from the independent sector is outdated,\u201d a DfE spokesperson said.", "title": "Ofsted chief criticises independent schools' lack of help for state schools", "sentences": ["He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a way of meeting the demands of the Charity Commission and not much else.\u201d \u201cI say this, really, in a sense of moral outrage, that they are opening up all these independent schools in Dubai and the Middle East and elsewhere \u2013 sucking in more of our teachers, who aren\u2019t going to Derby or Northampton or Grimsby or Hull, but going off to an independent school sponsored by the big public schools over here."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-09T18:16:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/mar/09/weatherwatch-ravilious-dubai-temperature-study", "tags": ["Meteorology", "Dubai", "Dubai"], "article": "As if Dubai weren\u2019t hot enough, this Middle Eastern city has inadvertently made itself significantly hotter over the past 14 years, according to a new study.

Hot favourite is Britain\u2019s star maths teacher, Colin Hegarty, whose videos are followed by a million viewers worldwide. Hegarty has been hailed as the great hope for British maths. Like much of the public realm, British maths is \u201cin crisis\u201d. The country is languishing alongside America way down every league table. Evidence of this was cited in a new poll from YouGov, measuring the public\u2019s knowledge of maths, science and English. In maths, roughly a third of those surveyed had no idea how to calculate a mode, a median, a \u201cline of best fit\u201d or the area of a circle. I seriously doubt this poll, since it implies that two-thirds did know the answers. All on whom I tested it failed, including myself. Nor could they see the point. With one voice they replied: \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of thing you learned at school.\u201d So what is the point? It merely ensures that many pupils, like the bright child of a friend of mine with maths blindness, have their schooling undermined by the government\u2019s fixation with maths.     Colin Hegarty has been shortlisted for the $1m Varkey Foundation teacher prize. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    There is nothing, except religion, as conservative as a school curriculum. It is drenched in archaic prejudice and vested interest. When the medieval church banned geography as an offence against the Bible, what had been the queen of the sciences never recovered. Instead Latin dominated the \u201cgrammar\u201d curriculum into the 20th century, to the expense of all science. Today maths is the new Latin. Science at least improved. In 1988 Thatcher hailed a \u201cdash for science\u201d to halt the decline in young people opting for science subjects. It failed completely. Then in 2006 a radical new GCSE syllabus dragged school science away from test tubes and Bunsen burners towards everyday life, to pollution, global warming, additives, health and diet. Since then the reactionaries have turned to maths as the talisman of educational success. It is in maths that we must beat the Chinese, the Singaporeans and the Finns. Pisa league tables of \u201ctop nations\u201d are pored over. Maths teachers are paid more, have their loans written off, are entered for global prizes. No one dares mention the calculator. Any league table that has China at the top, Britain at 26th and America at 36th tells me something more important than merely who is good at maths. If the US and Britain \u2013 among the most vigorous economies and most successful at science \u2013 are so bad at maths, it suggests their young people are applying themselves to something more useful. Chinese students are rushing to British and US universities to join them. No one would argue that pupils should not be able to add, subtract and multiply. But I studied higher maths, from calculus to number theory, and have forgotten the lot. All the maths I have needed comes from John Allen Paulos\u2019s timeless manual, Innumeracy. It is mostly how to understand proportion and risk, and tell when a statistician is trying to con you. I agree with the great mathematician GH Hardy, who accepted that higher maths was without practical application. It was rather a matter of intellectual stimulus and beauty. A new book by Michael Harris, Mathematics Without Apologies, goes to the extremes of this stimulus, to the categorical ladder, incompleteness theory and the Black-Scholes equation, used to assess financial derivatives. It ends in the \u201cinconsistency nightmare\u201d, that nought might possibly equal one. We accept the need for maths in advanced physics and in computing algorithms, much as we accept Greek for archaeology and Anglo-Saxon for early literature. The \u201cmathematics of finance\u201d school at Columbia University is lavishly sponsored by Wall Street firms, for good reason. But that does not mean every primary pupil must spend hours, indeed years, trying to learn equations and \u03c0r2, which they soon forget through disuse. Maths is for specialists, so why instil arithmophobia in the rest?   Related: The mathematical equation that caused the banks to crash    Charge the maths lobby with the uselessness of its subject and the answer is a mix of chauvinism and vacuity. Maths must be taught if we are to beat the Chinese (at maths). Or it falls back on primitivism, that maths \u201ctrains the mind\u201d. So does learning the Qur\u2019an and reciting Latin verbs. Meanwhile, the curriculum systematically denies pupils what might be of real use to them and society. There is no \u201cneed\u201d for more mathematicians. The nation needs, and therefore pays most for, more executives, accountants, salesmen, designers and creative thinkers. At the very least, today\u2019s pupils should go into the world with a knowledge of their history and geography, their environment, the working of their bodies, the upbringing of children, law, money, the economy and civil rights. This is in addition to self-confidence, emotional intelligence and the culture of the English imagination. All are crowded out by a political obsession with maths. The reason is depressingly clear. Maths is merely an easy subject to measure, nationally and internationally. It thus facilitates the bureaucratic craving for targetry and control.

The first Aviva Premiership game staged on foreign soil will in one sense be played in familiar surrounds: the Red Bull is an out-of-town bowl, its blue seats steeply raked, not unlike the Madejski outside Reading where the Irish usually play. But in all other senses, this is all new. In November, in town to lay the ground, Irish chief executive Bob Casey told the Guardian he hoped for \u201ca cracking day out, a good game of rugby\u201d and said: \u201cI think [a crowd of] anything over 15,000 would be great for year one.\u201d On Wednesday at the British residence on East 51st, as wine glasses clinked and Premier Rugby launched its Try Rugby USA programme, he thought something like that \u2013 and thus double the crowd for Irish\u2019s last home game with Sarries \u2013 remained within reach.  Ticket prices have attracted some local criticism; promotion by the hosting Legacy Agency continues in true New York style. Predictions from those in various forms of the know range from 6,000 to 20,000. Either way, only around 500 attendees will be UK-based Irish fans. This will be an American crowd. America, it is generally held, is ready for rugby union. Saturday\u2019s game, potentially the first of three across the Atlantic, will be broadcast by NBC, the network which this week announced it will show English club games next season. NBC has also shown the USA Sevens from Las Vegas, the Eagles\u2019 Chicago games against New Zealand and Australia and the Rugby World Cup. Jon Miller, president of programming for NBC Sports and NBC Sports Network, called the Premiership deal \u201can expansion of our well-documented commitment to the sport and growth of rugby in the US\u201d.

We\u2019re obviously in a situation where you try and grab hold of anything, in this last third of the season. So yeah, the point of difference here is that we\u2019re all away from home for a long time, we\u2019re meeting new people, new fans. \u201cBut we owe it to the club, we owe it to our fans, we owe it to ourselves.

Visors down, engines revving, they jockey for position ahead of the cars, trucks and buses on a specially marked patch of tarmac reserved for cyclists in many parts of the world. The buzz rises to a high-pitched crescendo and, as the lights turn green, they shoot off. A minute later the lights change and the process begins again. Taipei is home to almost one million scooters \u2013 as well as 2.7 million people. Like many other large Asian cities, the roads here are seen as no place for cyclists. But in the capital of Taiwan \u2013 an island once known as \u201cthe Bicycle Kingdom\u201d \u2013 the authorities have taken the unusual step of legalising cycling on 240 miles of city centre pavement. Taipei is also tripling its network of cycle lanes to cover 120 miles over the next three years \u2013 although these too are strips of painted sidewalk taken from pedestrians. Strange as it may seem, it works. Riding on the pavement feels 100% safe \u2013 for cyclists at least \u2013 and many of the riders are women, pedalling along at a leisurely pace and with hardly a helmet in sight. Picking your way through the city-centre pedestrians during rush hour may be pretty impossible, but in general the numbers are encouraging: whereas six or seven years ago few cyclists were to be seen in the city, now around 5% of journeys are taken by bike. That\u2019s around double the cycle modal share of London, for example, and four-times that of New York.     Taipei before cars, scooters and multi-level highways. Photograph: Taipics.com      YouBike has changed the image of the city. It\u2019s one of the city government\u2019s most popular policies  King Liu     \u201cWe want to be a cycle-friendly city, but we\u2019re not trying to be like Amsterdam or Copenhagen,\u201d Anne Chung, transport commissioner for Taipei, tells me on the sidelines of the VeloCity global cycling conference, which is taking place in Asia for the first time. \u201cThere are too many scooters and motorbikes at the moment and it is too dangerous to ride on the road with them, so the pavement is safer for cyclists. We want people to make cycling part of their lives and be able to combine cycling with the metro and buses for the \u2018last mile\u2019 of their journeys. We want to be able to tell car and motorbike users that there is a smarter way to get around.\u201d The YouBike cycle share system, a public-private partnership between manufacturer Giant and the city authorities, plays a key role. Since its launch in 2009, the YouBike network has grown to 7,000 bikes at more than 200 locations, most of them strategically placed next to metro stations and bus stops. Each bike is used an average of 8.6 times a day \u2013 the highest turnover rate in the world \u2013 and by 2018 the system will have grown to almost double its present size.   The transformation of Taipei: Fuxing Road - before and after Fuxing Road before and after: a lane was taken from cars and a segregated cycle lane built on the widened pavement   At the same time, Taipei has announced plans to more than triple the length of its network of segregated city centre bike lanes to 120 miles by 2019. In addition, there are 240 miles of shared use pavements, and 70 miles of riverside cycleways outside the city\u2019s flood defence levees, which are hugely popular with leisure cyclists at weekends. Combined with the implementation of on-street parking fees for cars and scooters, the approach seems to be working \u2013 a survey showed an estimated 31.2% of people riding YouBikes had switched from motorbikes and 4.4% from private cars.      Many YouBike riders are women \u2026 and few wear helmets    Taiwan earned its Bicycle Kingdom monicker in the 1980s, when the island\u2019s factories turned out more bikes than any other country in the world and the \u2018Made in Taiwan\u2019 label was ubiquitous. Facing increased competition from mainland China in the late 90s, Taiwanese bike manufacturers responded by ceding the low-cost end of the market, and concentrating on higher-spec machines. Giant and Merida have grown to become two of the world\u2019s biggest bike companies, and international firms such as Specialized, Trek and Colnago have manufacturing sites on the island. Recently, this interest in high-end bikes has found expression in the huge popularity of cycle tours of the island. Taipei\u2019s mayor, Ko Wen-je, completed a 325-mile route last month, topping a previous 235-mile excursion. Giant\u2019s president and founder, King Liu, has completed the full island circuit twice \u2013 the first time at the age of 73, and the second at 80 \u2013 cutting his time from 15 days to 12. Liu, now 82, calls his colourful, sturdy YouBikes the \u201clast piece of puzzle\u201d in Taipei\u2019s transformation. \u201cIt seemed impossible to introduce bike share with so many motorbikes and scooters,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAt the start the media, the public and politicians all disagreed with the vision of bike share. Motorbikes had dedicated lanes, but not cyclists. The rights of cyclists were not being taken care of well by the government.

It was one several education measures outlined by George Osborne on Wednesday, but teachers say there are barely enough specialist maths teachers to deliver GCSE in schools, let alone an extended programme to 18.

Providing great schooling is the single most important thing we can do to help any child from a disadvantaged background succeed. \u201cIt\u2019s also the single most important thing we can do to boost the long-term productivity of our economy, because our nation\u2019s productivity is no more and no less than the combined talents and efforts of the people of these islands.\u201d   Related: Our fixation with maths doesn\u2019t add up | Simon Jenkins    The government has called on Prof Sir Adrian Smith, vice chancellor of London University and former president of the Royal Statistical Society, to assess the feasibility of the initiative, which aims to ensure \u201cthe future workforce is skilled and competitive\u201d. The Labour education spokeswoman, Lucy Powell, supported the proposal but questioned its current viabilityand criticised the government for failing to achieve its target for recruiting maths teachers four years in a row. Labour points out that 20% of maths lessons are taught by teachers without relevant post-A-level qualifications and schools face increasing difficulties trying to fill maths posts. Teacher leaving rates are also above average. Labour called for English and maths to be studied until the age of 18 at the last election. \u201cThere is nothing more important to our global competitiveness than mathematics, which will drive success in digital skills, automation and other important jobs of the future,\u201d she said.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    \u201cYet this government\u2019s teacher shortage crisis is hitting maths acutely, with the Tories missing their target for recruiting maths teachers four years in a row.\u201d There has long been concern about the maths skills of UK children, who fare poorly in international tests. The latest Pisa tests, from 2013, put England in 26th place for maths, behind countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.   Related: A fifth of adults have forgotten how to do fractions or percentages    Last summer, 37% of the cohort failed to achieve a grade C or above in GCSE maths. Of those who were retaking \u2013 as required by the government \u2013 the figures were worse, with 64% failing to get the required C. Last weekend, the international education expert Andreas Schleicher told a conference that British schoolchildren were falling behind in maths because lessons in the subject were \u201ca mile wide and an inch deep\u201d. Schleicher, who is in charge of the Pisa tests, which are conducted on behalf of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said maths teaching in the UK was superficial because it focused on memorising facts, rather than concepts. The government is running an exchange programme with schools in Shanghai, where students are among the highest scoring in Pisa tests, in an attempt to improve maths education in England. Powell said: \u201cWith concerns from the OECD about the quality of the maths curriculum in schools and cuts to post-16 education, which have seen sixth-form colleges dropping Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) A-levels, it is hard to see how the Tories can achieve it under the current circumstances.\u201d   Related: A good memory is not a sign of education | Letters    A Department for Education spokesperson stressed the chancellor had announced a review and no final decisions had been made, but ministers are known to be concerned that far fewer students continue to study maths to 18 in England than in comparable countries.

Shearer, a former England captain turned football pundit, and Westwood, a golfer who has won tournaments on five continents, were at Cheltenham to watch their five-year-old mare Augusta Kate run in the only race at the meeting without any obstacles.

They were prepared to back Augusta Kate with serious money, too. Willie Mullins, her trainer, was responsible for seven of the 23 runners, including Bacardys, the mount of his main jockey Ruby Walsh, but the punters latched on to Augusta Kate and by the time the race started she was the 7-2 favourite ahead of Ballyandy, from the nearby Nigel Twiston-Davies stable, at 5-1. Augusta Kate\u2019s breeding may have played a part in the punt, as she is by Yeats, the only horse to win the Ascot Gold Cup four times, and her dam was the outstanding hurdler Feathard Lady, who was unbeaten in seven starts and ended her career with a victory in a Grade One race at Kempton.   Related: Bank on Thistlecrack in the World Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival    Westwood, meanwhile, was looking for a double at the meeting, having watched Ballyalton, a horse he shares with his father, John, take the concluding novices\u2019 handicap on Tuesday. The horse was a Christmas present for his father four years ago. Shearer, meanwhile, told an interviewer before Wednesday\u2019ss race that it was all about the experience. \u201cWe will have a great day whatever happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never expected to have one of the fancied runners in a race at the Cheltenham Festival. If the best happens, I might not come home on Wednesday night.\u201d Once the race started, both the owners and punters had reason to feel optimistic as Paul Townend, Augusta Kate\u2019s jockey, settled her behind the early leaders, apparently going well. He moved up towards the pace with two furlongs to run but was pushing hard soon afterwards and could not find any extra in the closing stages as Ballyandy and Battleford fought out a desperate finish, with two more Mullins\u2011trained horses close behind. Augusta Kate could finish only seventh behind Ballyandy, beaten about five lengths. Augusta Kate could still run at Punchestown\u2019s Festival in late April, however, while her form entitles her to be a useful novice hurdler next season. She also finished one place outside the prize money, though the \u00a3938 for finishing sixth would be unlikely to make much difference to her owners, whose interest, at this meeting above all, is in the excitement and the achievement of competing at Cheltenham. Shearer and Westwood both have long experience of the ups and downs of racehorse ownership, and will still have reason to hope that Augusta Kate will be a high achiever over jumps. Westwood co-owns the veteran sprinter Hoof It, the 2011 Stewards\u2019 Cup winner, with his manager, Chubby Chandler, who also has a share in Augusta Kate. Hoof It has won nine times in all, earning nearly \u00a3300,000 in prize money, and was sixth in the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes in 2011 after starting favourite at 11-4. Chandler and Westwood also had shares in Right Approach, who they bought from the Queen and went on to win the Dubai Turf, one of the most valuable events in world racing. Shearer has had shares in a long list of horses, including Justonefortheroad, who won eight races for him including an \u00a311,000 handicap at York at 25-1. But Westwood\u2019s first horse, In The Arena, often struggled to beat a single opponent, never mind finish in the frame.

Instead she got married and had five children. In 2000, when her youngest was established at school, Hroub resumed her education part-time at Al-Quds University. Within months, her husband, Omar, and two of her daughters were shot at by Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint near Bethlehem. Omar was injured in the shoulder and the girls were traumatised.

The Irish rebels tunnelled through the walls of neighbouring buildings until they reached the terrace at 14-17 Moore Street. Almost a week later, fearing further civilian casualties in the city, rebel leader Patrick Pearse agreed to surrender from their new headquarters at No 16. One hundred years on, as Irish soldiers prepare to lay down wreaths on Easter Sunday at the spot to mark the uprising\u2019s centenary, Moore Street has once again become a battlefield, pitting the government and developers, who want to demolish some of the properties either side of 14-17 to make way for a shopping complex, against campaigners who say such a development would be a \u201cdemolition of history\u201d.     Bomb damage in Dublin in 1916 following the Easter Rising. Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images    The project would preserve the four houses that the rebels escaped to, turning them into a visitors\u2019 centre, but not the surrounding buildings, because, the government argues, they are not historically significant. The protesters vehemently disagree, and have been occupying the terrace in order to \u201clock out\u201d construction workers. Nowadays this end of the street is rather rundown and hardly has the feel of an Irish national shrine. Last week, the only flag flying was that of Romania, above the Transylvanian Food Store. London-born Patrick Cooney, a veteran of the Save Moore Street campaign, believes that once the 1916 centenary events are over, planning officials will push forward with the development project, which would allow for a UK retail company to be the anchor tenant.     Moore Street is now home to shops catering for Dublin\u2019s diverse immigrant community. Photograph: Alamy    Looking out at the boarded up historic houses in the street, Cooney, a descendant of the original IRA London unit, said: \u201cIf they [the developers] get their way and there is a glass domed roof and big UK shopping giant who can provide massive rates-revenue for the council, then we might as well be in Dubai rather than this historically important quarter of Dublin. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to think that in the year we are marking the centenary of the Rising, that rather than regenerate the area and turn it into a communal marketplace, they want a shopping centre dreamed up from the worst days of the 1980s.\u201d Chalked on the boards covering the four Moore Street houses are messages of defiance from the protesters, including one directed at the construction workers tasked with rebuilding the strip. It reads: \u201cNo work today lads.\u201d The opponents of the Moore Street plan initially occupied the houses, then began a court case that is still running in Dublin\u2019s high court. More recently, to ensure no reconstruction work is carried out, the protesters have put chains and locks on the entrances, allowing only security guards to go in every day to check for any damage.   Map showing Moore Street, Dublin   Damien Farrell is one of those doing 12-hour shifts to ensure none of the workers gets on to the site. The Dubliner, who has been part of the lockout since February, said he was determined to keep going until they can be sure the shopping centre plan had been dropped. \u201cI will be here on Easter Monday and far beyond to keep the lockout going. We will continue to monitor what the builder is up to and fight on long after the centenary is over until we are certain the street is safe from that kind of development. \u201cThere\u2019s a team of dedicated volunteers here who continue this totally peaceful protests and who have been here in the wind, the rain and the hail over the last few months. We won\u2019t give up,\u201d Farrell said. Among those backing the protest is James Connolly-Heron, the great grandson of the executed uprising leader James Connolly. After conducting a tour of Moore Street with a party of secondary schoolchildren, Connolly-Heron said his great grandfather would have been taking part in the occupation and lockout if he were alive today. Speaking in Moore Lane, a narrow offshoot of Moore Street where discarded needles point to its use as a shooting gallery for Dublin\u2019s heroin addicts, Connolly-Heron said: \u201cWhat the British failed to do in terms of destroying this historic quarter we are about to do ourselves in terms of the the decay and dereliction around Moore Street.

It is the sort of thing a big-time jockey might say in announcing his retirement but, after a 2015 spent largely in dreamland, the 45-year-old is horrified at the very idea and quickly moves from wistful to purposeful. There are still mountains left to conquer. Chief among his ambitions for this year is getting to 3,000 winners in Britain. He has already passed that figure in winners partnered all around the world but that appears not to matter quite so much. Unprompted, he reels off the list of jockeys who have been more successful than him in this country: Sir Gordon Richards, Pat Eddery, Lester Piggott, Willie Carson, Doug Smith. Impressively he makes a fair stab at how many winners Smith (3,112) and Carson (3,828) had. But the illusion of a man with all significant racing statistics on instant recall rather evaporates when he reveals he does not know his own tally. He is delighted to be told it is 2,942, meaning that a reasonably fruitful summer will get him to the proposed landmark around the time of Glorious Goodwood in late July. \u201cNot bad for a foreigner!\u201d he cries, in full clown mode after a morning filming adverts for Ladbrokes, during which his personality has expanded to fill a plush bar looking on to Grosvenor Square. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got me excited now \u2026 \u201d He mimes picking up a phone to his agent. \u201cHullo? Put me down for Southwell!\u201d     Frankie Dettori was unveiled as Ladbrokes\u2019 new ambassador on Monday. Photograph: Joe Newman/SWNS/WWF-UK    Just to be clear, he will not be going to Southwell unless his two principal employers, the owner Al Shaqab and the trainer John Gosden, positively insist. Indeed, it seems he will be doing his best to avoid all-weather venues much closer to his Newmarket base. Even now that his popularity is restored to its former height and almost anyone in the game would be glad to have him aboard, he could not care less about trying to recover the champion jockey\u2019s title he last won in 2004. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll be honest, I have no desire whatsoever. I have no interest. It\u2019s hard work. Who wins is the guys who go to Chelmsford every Friday and Wednesday and they try hard and good luck to them but it doesn\u2019t appeal to me. I\u2019ll still ride every day. When John\u2019s got runners or we\u2019ve got runners, I\u2019ll go.\u201d This should not be seen as laziness. Spool back a couple of decades and there was a year in which Dettori had more than 1,300 mounts. His more restrained approach to the job is intended to leave him fresh for the days that matter most and to extend his career for at least the next five years.   Related: Frankie Dettori wins Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe on Golden Horn    \u201cI\u2019ll get to 50, no problem. Then after that I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ll carry on as long as I can.

Golden Horn, who gave him his second Derby success last year, as well as a fourth Arc, has gone to stud but Dettori\u2019s potential stars for 2016 include Foundation, who will go to the Craven Stakes next month in order that connections can decide which European Classic would be the best option for him. Gosden\u2019s So Mi Dar is prominent in betting on the Oaks and then there is Shalaa for the top-class sprints, having been \u201cthe best two-year-old I\u2019ve ridden\u201d last year. More immediately he has Mshawish in Saturday\u2019s Dubai World Cup. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential there. I don\u2019t want to start writing a short list. This is just the start. But there are a lot of horses there that can develop into anything. Look, this time last year, who knew what Golden Horn was? He was a maiden winner. I didn\u2019t know who he was. There could be another Golden Horn behind the scenes. Who knows? That\u2019s all to play for.\u201d   Related: Frankie Dettori says Deauville winner Shalaa is \u2018colt of a lifetime\u2019    Dettori also has a valuable alliance with the US\u2019s Wesley Ward, now familiar through his Royal Ascot exploits as a trainer of extraordinarily well-muscled and precocious juveniles. The jockey smiles as he deliberates and then decides to reveal: \u201cI think Wesley is sending a couple of two-year-olds early doors, not just for Ascot. Even the Brocklesby at Doncaster was mentioned.\u201d The Brocklesby is famous within racing as the first two-year-old race of each new turf season, though its significance is often no greater than that. The presence of one of Ward\u2019s behemoths would certainly enliven proceedings. But what Dettori really wants from Ward, indeed what he wants from most of his employers, is the chance to win a big race at Royal Ascot, an event he is already anticipating three months in advance. \u201cPeople ask why I like Ascot so much. It\u2019s a big crowd, the crowd gets behind me, I feel the atmosphere. That\u2019s what makes me tick. \u201cAs you get older, you understand how to channel it.

The Black and Yellows were even lucky to go in level at half-time, after Augsburg\u2019s Icelandic striker Alfred Finnbogason had given the relegation-threatened home side an early lead. Thomas Tuchel\u2019s men looked sluggish: \u201cwe appeared like a side that had carried a heavy load, physically and mentally, in the recent past\u201d admitted the BVB coach, \u201cthere were many small mistakes, no pace. It was difficult to cover the spaces, to pass into spaces, to be aggressive and tight in the Gegenpressing.\u201d One of their very few decent moves in the first half, a combination between Marco Reus, Nuri Sahin and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, resulted in the latter squeezing in a deflected equaliser seconds before the break.    Related: Pep Guardiola targeting Bayern\u2019s Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara for Manchester City    Dortmund came back stronger, calmer, more focused, and in the end, their movement overwhelmed the hard-working home side. Gonzalo Castro and striker Adrian Ramos, deputising for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who was on compassionate leave, secured all three points for the second-best team in Germany. It was Dortmund\u2019s 13th win in 15 games since the winter break, only the mighty Hertha (0-0) and Pep Guardiola\u2019s Bayern (0-0) have managed to hold them in 2016.  Dortmund\u2019s outrageous consistency in all three competitions has banished all talk about the Europa League\u2019s alleged negative effect but it was interesting to hear Mats Hummels suggest that they might have been even closer to Bayern \u2013 who are still ahead by five points \u2013 if it weren\u2019t for the Thursday-Sunday rhythm that has had them playing catch-up throughout the season. \u201cWe would love them to be in a situation where we win our game [first] and then maybe see them feel a bit of pressure,\u201d said Dortmund\u2019s captain. \u201cBut you have say they\u2019re playing with incredible dominance. But if they stutter, we\u2019ll be there, on their coat tails. Let\u2019s see how long this will carry on.\u201d  The result at Augsburg might have been regulation, but the performance was still exemplary. Hummels praised his side\u2019s maturity while Tuchel said \u201cthey showed extraordinary attitude and willingness to win.\u201d. The ascetic, mostly-vegan 42-year-old has toned down the volume and the rhetoric after J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s departure, his sentences carry fewer exclamations marks and his team\u2019s buildup play is more measured. But the team\u2019s relentless drive is reminiscent of Klopp\u2019s title-winning years, where winning had also become a habit and the team is completely at ease with their hard-working ways. \u201cWe have to enjoy overcoming resistance,\u201d Tuchel had vowed with typical, monk-like devotion. His former president at Mainz, Harald Strutz, once said that he was afraid to greet the coach in the morning during training camps, for fear of breaking his concentration. It\u2019s become patently clear that his combination of an improved dietary regime (no wheat, no sugar) and tactical and mental fine-tuning of the players have taken this side to a new level. Tuchel has looked at their sleeping habits and prescribed books to read. Mkhitaryan, one of Europe\u2019s most gifted technicians but also fragile soul, has learned to stop worrying after reading Timothy Gallwey\u2019s \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like it was written especially for me,\u201d said the Armenian midfielder. \u201cI used to make all the mistakes mentioned there. I\u2019m really grateful that the coach has changed the way I think.\u201d  At White Hart Lane on Thursday, Tuchel said the team\u2019s professional, positive attitude was \u201cthe glue\u201d that held everything together. He\u2019s been a stickler for politeness and humility since his arrival in Westphalia, and there\u2019s no question that his ultra-dedicated yet modest ways have rubbed off on his squad. Back in December, local paper Ruhrnachrichten reported that upon his return from the training camp in Dubai, Julian Weigl found a note in his letterbox from a young boy living next door; they both shared the same first name and the lad had written to his idol. Weigl, Dortmund\u2019s 20-year-old shooting star, a midfielder generating interest all over Europe, decided to pay him a visit with his girlfriend Sarah. The two of them end up staying for two hours at their neighbour\u2019s house and at the end of that afternoon, Sarah offered to babysit for young Julian in the future. It\u2019s a story that seems barely credible. But it\u2019s true.  In a pure sporting sense, their rapid return to greatness is all the more remarkable if you consider that they lost the iconic Klopp after seven years in May and have had to fend off bids \u2013 both dreamt up by interested parties and real \u2013 for many of their star performers on a daily basis. Players\u2019 wages come in at \u20ac130m per season, roughly half of Chelsea\u2019s outlay, which just goes to show that their elite-level football doesn\u2019t have to command elite-level pay-checks and transfer fees. It\u2019s a minor miracle in this day and age, and should be appreciated as such, even if Tuchel\u2019s brilliantly re-engineered Dortmund machine has made winning all the time look almost ordinary. Talking Points Michael Henke, the man best known for high-fiving Ottmar Hitzfeld on the touchline at Dortmund and Bayern, revealed a shocking conspiracy at the heart of the German game on Saturday. \u201cYou get totally robbed here,\u201d the Ingolstadt assistant coach thundered from beneath his tin foil hat after the Bavarian club\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Hertha, \u201cit\u2019s all because German capital has to play in the Champions League.\u201d It\u2019s one explanation for Pal Dardai\u2019s men doing so well but leaves one, very troubling question: does Angela Merkel know how the Uefa coefficient works?    Related: Germany\u2019s Joachim L\u00f6w drops Max Kruse from squad over bad behaviour    Hertha, incidentally, are looking for a new ground as it\u2019s tricky to fill the old Olympic stadium. \u201cWe need to start the discussion (about building our own),\u201d said sporting director Michael Preetz. Berlin-based Max Kruse, who occasionally turns out for reasonably nearby VfL Wolfsburg in between poker competitions, might soon be looking for new home, too. The 28-year-old forward was suspended from Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s Germany squad, with the club\u2019s backing, after getting into an argument with a woman who had taken photos of him in a nightclub on Saturday night (Kruse had taken her phone and deleted the offending pics). \u201cIt was time to send a signal,\u201d said VfL sporting director Klaus Allofs, who hinted that Kruse\u2019s bon vivant ways had been a problem in the past as well. After losing \u20ac75,000 (\u00a359,000) in a Berlin cab recently, Kruse was also ticked off for eating too much Nutella by his manager Dieter Hecking last week. He is, in other words, most unlikely to receive an offer from Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Dortmund any time soon.

On Monday, the lawyer for Alaradi said the terrorism charges had been dropped for all four men. \u201cIt came as quite a surprise to us all,\u201d said Paul Champ.  The charges related to support allegedly given by the four businessmen to two militias, Libya Dawn and the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, which emerged during the 2011 revolution in Libya. The four have denied having any relationship with or providing any support to the militias. The men now face less serious chargesfor providing supplies to groups in a foreign country and collecting donations without the UAE government\u2019s permission, Champ said.

Champ was encouraged by Monday\u2019s development, describing it as significant. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re changing course now suggests to me that they\u2019re concerned that Mr Alaradi might actually get a fair trial.\u201d But the families of those detained were more apprehensive about the latest chapter in their long ordeal, with the daughter of Kamal Eldarat questioning the sudden decision to drop the terrorism charges.   \u201cToday\u2019s change of course is deeply concerning,\u201d said Amal Eldarat in a statement. \u201cFor more than a year and a half, the UAE government has had time to investigate the alleged charges against my brother and father and proceed with presenting their case. Now, after more than 550 days, they have been forced to recognize what my family and I have said along \u2013 Kamal and Mohamed are innocent of all terrorism charges.\u201d  She called on US officials to pressure the UAE to release her father and brother, who could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty of the new charges. \u201cThis continues to be an indescribable nightmare that will only end when my brother and father are allowed to return home.\u201d In Canada, the Alaradi family expressed similar trepidation over the decision. \u201cThis change is not good,\u201d said 18-year-old Marwa Alaradi, whose father was on vacation in Dubai with his family when he was arrested. \u201cHow can a state security who held my father for 550 days, more than enough time to investigate, come at the end of the trial and change the whole charge?\u201d  After two Libyans facing similar charges in the UAE were acquitted last week, she worried the prosecutor had downgraded the charge against her father in order to ensure a guilty verdict. \u201cSo this charge or the old charge \u2013 it is all fabricated. The closer we get to his innocence, the more the UAE state security plays games with his freedom.\u201d  She urged Canadian officials to intervene. \u201cI hope the government will negotiate and somehow force the UAE to get my father home to us.\u201d  The trial has attracted international attention, including criticisms from groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International over the UAE\u2019s treatment of the detainees. In February, a report by the UN working group on arbitrary detention called for the immediate release of the four men, documenting the men\u2019s claims that they were subjected to electric shocks, whipped, had guns held to their heads, were drugged and \u201chung with a rope around the neck\u201d.

Faced with a choice between the widest box of all and the stall just inside, Sherman opted for 11 of 12, but while it is not the perfect pitch for last year\u2019s runner\u2011up the trainer remains confident that California Chrome will go one better this time. Even with the form inked into the book for the past 12 months, it is still hard to believe that last year\u2019s Dubai World Cup unfolded as it did. Hokko Tarumae, from Japan, went off much too hard from stall two and California Chrome, the favourite then as he is expected to be on Saturday, was not just caught wide from stall nine but also too close to the strong pace. The race fell apart in the straight and the outsider Prince Bishop, who had been tailed off after two furlongs, came through to beat California Chrome by nearly three lengths. It was about as unsatisfactory as a $10m horse race can be, but it did at least leave California Chrome\u2019s connections with some unfinished business. The five-year-old returns to Dubai without his former co-owner Steve Coburn, famous for his stetson and some forthright opinions, who sold his share last year. Sherman, though, cannot wait for Saturday night.   Related: Prince Bishop wins Dubai World Cup from hot favourite California Chrome    \u201cAfter being second last year, it was a challenge,\u201d Sherman said here on Wednesday. \u201cAnd after watching him train [earlier] this year, I said that I\u2019d like to try it one more time. He\u2019s five years old, and a horse does its best racing in maturity as a five\u2011year\u2011old. We don\u2019t get to see many five-year-olds running any more, the way\u00a0they go to the breeding shed fairly quick, but I\u2019ve always wanted to see what\u00a0he would be like, fully mature and ready to go. \u201cI\u2019ve been with him ever since he was a two-year-old. He just looks like a man now. I looked at him in his stall the other day, and I hadn\u2019t seen him for a month and I thought, either I\u2019m shrinking, or he\u2019s getting bigger. He\u2019s really at his peak. In the [2014] Breeders\u2019 Cup [Classic], he was beaten a neck [behind Bayern and Toast Of New York] and he\u2019s far superior to what he was then. It\u2019s going to make a big difference. His training has been wonderful, there\u2019s no excuses.\u201d As for that tricky outside draw, Sherman admits that would not have been his choice had California Chrome emerged from the hat first rather than second\u2011last. It should not be an insurmountable problem, though. \u201cTo tell you the truth, about seven or eight would have been ideal,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWhen we look at the form, we might have to change our strategy a little bit. He\u00a0has quite a bit of speed if a guy wants to use it. \u201cI\u2019ll have to look at the PPs [post positions] and study a lot of these horses that I don\u2019t know from different countries, but I know all the US horses and it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to be out there in the 11 hole. If he breaks clean and goes, I could be in a good position by the first turn I think. \u201cWe lost ground on every turn last year, it seemed like he had to lose maybe three or four lengths in the race. Being a former jockey, I know that saving ground means a lot, it was a five-horse spread and they were bumping each other. If he gets it a little smoother, I think he\u2019ll run really well.\u201d   Related: California Chrome gets easy win in prep-race for Dubai World Cup    Sherman became the oldest trainer to saddle a Kentucky Derby winner when California Chrome won at Churchill Downs two years ago, and remains a compelling strand in the horse\u2019s story. Now 78, he set out to become a jockey in the mid-1950s when a customer in his father\u2019s barber shop suggested he had the right size and build, and was the work-rider on Swaps, the 1955 Kentucky Derby winner and one of American racing\u2019s all-time greats. Sherman spent 30 years as a trainer before sending out his first Grade One winner, at the now-defunct Hollywood Park, in 2006, but it is California Chrome\u2019s exploits both in victory and defeat that have earned the trainer a permanent place in the hearts of racing fans, in America and beyond. The \u201cChromies\u201d, as the horse\u2019s most devoted followers style themselves, also ensure that the five-year-old is never short of treats. \u201cThey had a going away party for him [at home], there were doughnuts for the barn and flowers,\u201d Sherman says. \u201cHe\u2019s got a fanfare all over the world, it\u2019s just a privilege to be able to train a horse like him. \u201cWhen I saw him the other day, I had my cookies ready for him. The minute he hears my voice, he knows I\u2019m going to bring him a goodie. Mrs Pastures cookies, he loves those, oh man. There\u2019s 75lbs sitting outside his barn, we\u2019ll never have to worry.\u201d California Chrome drifted slightly in the betting for the World Cup as a result of his wide draw, but is still clear favourite at a best price of 15-8 with Frosted (stall nine), another American dirt specialist, next in the list at 5-2. Todd Pletcher\u2019s Mshawish (stall two), who took the Grade One Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida last month, is a 14-1 chance and it is 16-1 bar the top three. The focus of attention this weekend, though, will inevitably be on Sherman, California Chrome and the attempt to atone for last year\u2019s defeat. \u201cSecond place don\u2019t get it,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI\u2019m going for the whole enchilada this time.\u201d", "title": "Favourite California Chrome gets poor outside draw in Dubai World Cup", "sentences": ["By the time Art Sherman climbed on to a stage here on Wednesday to pick a stall for California Chrome in Saturday\u2019s Dubai World Cup, his options were decidedly limited.", "Even with the form inked into the book for the past 12 months, it is still hard to believe that last year\u2019s Dubai World Cup unfolded as it did.", "The five-year-old returns to Dubai without his former co-owner Steve Coburn, famous for his stetson and some forthright opinions, who sold his share last year.", "Related: Prince Bishop wins Dubai World Cup from hot favourite California Chrome    \u201cAfter being second last year, it was a challenge,\u201d Sherman said here on Wednesday.", "If he gets it a little smoother, I think he\u2019ll run really well.\u201d   Related: California Chrome gets easy win in prep-race for Dubai World Cup    Sherman became the oldest trainer to saddle a Kentucky Derby winner when California Chrome won at Churchill Downs two years ago, and remains a compelling strand in the horse\u2019s story."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-23T13:50:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/23/horse-racing-tips-thursday-24-march", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Chepstow 2.05 Hollies Pearl 2.40 Closer To Home 3.15 Set In My Ways (nb) 3.50 Long John 4.25 Old Magic 5.00 Shaddaii 5.30 Join Together    Related: Favourite California Chrome gets poor outside draw in Dubai World Cup    Ludlow 2.30 Magic Music Man 3.05 Sir Pitt 3.40 Unbuckled 4.15 Parsnip Pete 4.50 On The Bridge 5.20 Mo Chailin 5.50 Ridgeway Flyer  Wolverhampton 2.15 Evervescent 2.50 Anton Chigurh 3.25 Prominna 4.00 Powerful Dream 4.35 Teversham 5.10 Skylark Lady (nap) 5.40 Intermittent 6.10 Ellaal ", "title": "Horse racing tips: Thursday 24 March", "sentences": ["Chepstow 2.05 Hollies Pearl 2.40 Closer To Home 3.15 Set In My Ways (nb) 3.50 Long John 4.25 Old Magic 5.00 Shaddaii 5.30 Join Together    Related: Favourite California Chrome gets poor outside draw in Dubai World Cup    Ludlow 2.30 Magic Music Man 3.05 Sir Pitt 3.40 Unbuckled 4.15 Parsnip Pete 4.50 On The Bridge 5.20 Mo Chailin 5.50 Ridgeway Flyer  Wolverhampton 2.15 Evervescent 2.50 Anton Chigurh 3.25 Prominna 4.00 Powerful Dream 4.35 Teversham 5.10 Skylark Lady (nap) 5.40 Intermittent 6.10 Ellaal "], "publicationDate": "2016-03-23T16:12:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/23/jack-nowell-exeter-saracens-premiership", "tags": ["Exeter", "Saracens", "England rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "article": "Exeter\u2019s grand slam-winning wing Jack Nowell will miss the top-of-the-table Premiership fixture at Saracens on Saturday because his club still feel it is too risky to play him on artificial pitches.

That Wednesday\u2019s announcement from the British Horseracing Authority follows hard on the heels of a BHA promise to divert extra money into battling corruption if the revolution in racing funding comes to fruition can only be to the benefit of a sport which, Timeform point out, now spends \u00a316.4m on integrity, down significantly from a peak of \u00a325m. \u201cEvidence of corruption in British horse racing is not hard to find \u2013 the 12-year ban imposed on once-promising apprentice Darren Egan for \u2018stopping\u2019 horses laid by a professional punter isn\u2019t the first such case and it won\u2019t be the last \u2013 and racing cannot afford to be complacent,\u201d state Timeform, adding: \u201cIt must prove to the public that the sport is run strictly \u2026 the trust of racegoers and punters in the integrity of racing, particularly as a betting medium, is fragile at the best of times.\u201d The biggest scandal in racing in modern times involved a Newmarket yard run by Godolphin and it is that organisation\u2019s travails on the track, coupled with the rise and rise of the rival Coolmore operation, mainly through the exploits of trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien, which are detailed in a number of Timeform\u2019s trademark extended essays on the best equine performers of last year. O\u2019Brien \u201chas never had a stronger hand in the first two Classics [the 2,000 and 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket]\u201d with Air Force Blue and Minding respectively. Timeform state the trainer \u201cis spot on\u201d to claim Air Force Blue \u201cis the best two-year-old we\u2019ve ever had [at Ballydoyle]\u201d, while Minding was \u201cnot only the highest-rated two-year-old filly in 2015, but in fact one of the highest-rated two-year-old fillies trained in Europe in recent decades\u201d. In contrast, Timeform argue, in their essay on Godolphin\u2019s top-class Tryster, that \u201cthe days of Mark of Esteem, Halling, Swain, Daylami, Dubai Millennium, Fantastic Light and Sakhee now seem a long time ago for those who have followed Godolphin since its inception. Godolphin\u2019s first period of pre-eminence was founded on quality \u2013 Saeed bin Suroor operated originally with a string of 40 or 50 \u2013 but in the last decade it has owed its position among Britain\u2019s leading owners to quantity. \u201cGodolphin had its successes in some of the top races [in 2015] \u2013 but bin Suroor and Charlie Appleby couldn\u2019t muster a Group One win between them in Britain or Europe \u2026 the meagre European pattern-race tally of its two private yards over the past couple of years has to be addressed by the appointment of Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s bloodstock adviser John Ferguson as chief executive. Ferguson\u2019s aim is to continue to restore the stable\u2019s reputation, tainted by the steroids scandal of 2013, and to ensure that Godolphin continues to represent excellence.\u201d Not that it was all plain sailing for the Coolmore Stud/Ballydoyle axis either in 2015, with the campaigning of the impressive Newmarket 2,000 Guineas winner Gleneagles serving to heighten the tensions between the Ballydoyle trainer and the owners grouped under the Coolmore banner. \u201cThe decision-making process around running plans for Ballydoyle\u2019s top horses can be tortuous,\u201d highlight Timeform in their ruminations on the numerous Gleneagles-related \u2018will-he-won\u2019t-he-run\u2019 sagas that peppered the second half of the season. \u201cNo running plans are issued from Ballydoyle until they have been agreed by all the major partners \u2013 \u2018the lads\u2019 [as O\u2019Brien refers to them] \u2013 which often leaves [the trainer] hedging his bets about future plans in post-race interviews (a process O\u2019Brien describes as \u2018trying to say something without saying anything\u2019).\u201d One of the chief targets for both outfits will be the Epsom Oaks, won by O\u2019Brien\u2019s seeming third-string Qualify in 2015, but a race whose drop in value is noted by Timeform as being indicative of a decline in the Classic races, \u201cits value in Britain having dropped in recent years below that of the British Champion Fillies\u2019 and Mares\u2019 Stakes and the Nassau Stakes\u201d. Another long-standing issue for the sport is that of the use of the whip which comes under scrutiny, this time in particular with regards to the King George winner Postponed, whose rider Andrea Atzeni was banned for six days for using his stick above the permitted level and also hitting winner down the shoulder. \u201cThe rules need to be flexible enough to fit individual cases and should place more emphasis on incorrect use of the whip, rather than how often it is used,\u201d argue Timeform, who also controversially agree with those suggesting disqualification be among the sanctions available to raceday officials. \u201cThe stewards should be given the ultimate power \u2013 which they do not have at present \u2013 to disqualify horses in extreme cases of whip abuse as, for example, when Frankie Dettori struck Rewilding 24 times in the last two furlongs of the 2011 Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes.\u201d One point on which the majority in the sport can surely agree is Timeform\u2019s assertion that \u201ccloser harmonisation of racing\u2019s rules is needed as racing becomes increasingly international (there were more than a thousand British-trained runners on foreign soil in the latest season)\u201d. In their essay on the British St Leger winner, Simple Verse, Timeform state: \u201cThe International Federation of Horseracing Authorities is not responsible for staging racing\u2019s major international occasions, such as the Breeders\u2019 Cup and the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe meeting, and can only advise and encourage from the sidelines (although, in that regard, it isn\u2019t doing enough). \u201cA governing body such as Fifa, for example, which organises football\u2019s World Cup, is in a position to implement changes to a set of rules that already apply worldwide. As with drug use, horse racing has no accepted worldwide set of rules governing interference and disqualification, inevitably leading to confusion and friction at times which affects the integrity of a sport that has become increasingly international.\u201d There are plenty of other subjects under scrutiny in the pages covering 10,980 individuals, with a useful section comprising Timeform\u2019s famous \u2018p\u2019 horses, those horses thought likely to improve, and the ones given a capital \u2018P\u2019, those considered \u201ccapable of much better\u201d. The Newmarket trainer Luca Cumani can be relied on to plot profitable campaigns with middle-distance handicappers and Laurence (97p) is one to watch out for on fast ground this summer while, if only for the name, Mitchum Swagger (115p) from the David Lanigan yard is another to note.

When will the bigots stop painting us all with the same brush? When will they stop conflating politics and religion? Muslims mourn those who died in Brussels, just like everybody else does. We empathise in just the same way. But Islamophobia distracts the world from this. Our common enemy is terrorism, not Islam, and terrorism does not stop at the Black Sea. From Boko Haram in Nigeria to Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia, militants are tearing non-European and Muslim lives apart too. But Islamophobia gives us a Eurocentric definition of tragedy in which terrorism only seems to matter when it encroaches on European shores. Brown and black lives are not afforded the same respect.

A million Turkish people live in Berlin, 3 million in Germany \u2013 do they not deserve Merkel\u2019s solidarity? Our behaviour on social media reflects this selective mourning: #JeSuisBruxelles is trending while #JeSuisAnkara struggles to be heard. Yes, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) are not Isis.

A violinist, a politician, a teacher. But Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdish, Turkish and Afghan lives are taken in a world too often presented as savage and hopeless. At best, they feature in a picture that haunts the west for a matter of weeks. At worst, they are just a statistic in the Sunday paper. Like bombs, tragedy does not discriminate.

It will not return sons and daughters to grieving mothers, but it can offer vindication and closure. Justice, unlike tragedy, is too often coloured by society\u2019s prejudices.

And yes, we have heard that one before. Several times, in fact, over the course of a dozen seasons, since Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Ballydoyle operation usurped Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin as the leading power in European Flat racing. The statement of intent has arrived in the run-up to the Dubai World Cup and has often been followed by success for the royal blue colours on the richest card of the year. Away from home turf, however, the momentum has soon ebbed away. This year, perhaps, it will finally be different. The arrival of John Ferguson, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s longstanding bloodstock advisor, as Godolphin\u2019s new chief executive seems to have given the organisation a fresh sense of purpose, nearly a quarter of a century after it sent out its first runner in 1992. This is also the season when the blue-blooded yearlings bought in a \u00a317m spending spree at Tattersalls in October 2014 will be part of the Classic generation. If the money was well spent, the moment to live up to their pedigrees has arrived. Then again, a glance at the betting for the 2016 Classics suggests that Godolphin still have a long way to travel. O\u2019Brien\u2019s team of three-year-olds includes Air Force Blue, the even-money favourite for the 2,000 Guineas, and Minding, who heads the market for the 1,000 Guineas. The marketing department at Coolmore Stud, which supplies Ballydoyle with its racing stock, could have written the betting for the Oaks. Minding is favourite, followed by horses named Ballydoyle and Coolmore. Godolphin is not even the top dog in Newmarket any more. John Gosden, last season\u2019s champion trainer, has Godolphin-owned horses in his yard, including Jack Hobbs, last year\u2019s Irish Derby winner, but trains for several other major owners besides. In 2015, Gosden\u2019s stable won more prize money than Godolphin\u2019s two full-time trainers, Charlie Appleby and the former champion Saeed bin Suroor, put together. The intention, though, is that Godolphin will be a serious competitor for all this year and the first horse to attempt to put the plan into practice will be Emotionless, a deeply impressive winner of last season\u2019s Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket on 30 April. Emotionless started second-favourite behind Air Force Blue for last year\u2019s Dewhurst Stakes but finished last of seven and was subsequently found to have chipped a bone in his knee. \u201cThere was a lot of publicity about him going into the Dewhurst and it was good publicity,\u201d Appleby, his trainer, said here on Thursday. \u201cWe want to get back to competing at the highest level against Ballydoyle, that\u2019s what everyone likes to see, the two biggest stables in Europe taking each other on. \u201cIt was a disappointment on the day and all of a sudden he\u2019s gone very cold [in the Classic market], but he had a valid excuse for that run. If you\u2019re asking if he\u2019s overpriced [at 14-1], then yes. I have a lot of confidence in the horse and he\u2019s shown every sign that he\u2019s as good now that he\u2019s strengthened up. \u201cHe\u2019s in full work. We spoke about a trial and decided that we would go straight to the Guineas.\u201d Appleby\u2019s big hope on Saturday night is Tryster, the winner of last year\u2019s Easter Classic on Good Friday, in the Dubai Turf, one of the season\u2019s most valuable events on grass. Tryster completed the last two furlongs at Lingfield in 20.97s, one of the fastest final-quarter sectionals ever recorded by a middle-distance performer in Britain. He then returned to turf in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown and finished last of five. As a result, many punters still think of him as a failure on grass, despite two impressive victories on the surface at Meydan already this year, earned with his trademark turn of foot. \u201cHe improved with every run last winter and his run style was the exciting part about it,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cThen we decided to go to Sandown and it just didn\u2019t materialise on the day. \u201cNeedless to say, a lot of people jumped on the bandwagon and said: \u2018He\u2019s not a turf horse,\u2019 but his run style is a hold-up horse and that\u2019s not a typical Sandown style of race. A small field was probably a contributing factor as well and, perhaps more importantly, he\u2019d been on the go all winter. He needed a break. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have a better platform to go into the race than his two starts out here. There\u2019s probably a very different pace angle to what we\u2019ve encountered with Tryster before, when they\u2019ve always gone steady and it\u2019s suited us because we\u2019ve got such an exceptional turn of foot, but they won\u2019t be going steady on Saturday, that\u2019s for sure. \u201cHe\u2019s my best chance of having a winner on World Cup night, there\u2019s no negatives about him whatsoever. The horse is in great form and the jockey is in great form.\u201d That jockey is William Buick, who took last year\u2019s World Cup on Prince Bishop and has a clear chance to win the feature race again on Frosted, the second-favourite behind the 2014 Kentucky Derby winner, California Chrome. This year\u2019s World Cup is the second to be staged at Meydan on a dirt surface and Frosted, who runs for Godolphin\u2019s main US trainer, Kiaran McLaughlin, is part of a strong challenge from the States. As a three-year-old last season, he finished fourth in the Kentucky Derby behind American Pharoah and then second in the Belmont Stakes as the same horse completed the Triple Crown a few weeks later. \u201cHe has great form in the States and he ran against American Pharoah on nearly every run, which is a hard task,\u201d Buick said here. \u201cHe\u2019s come out here and thrived. Kiaran was very happy with him before he ran [at Meydan in early February]. \u201cThat race went very smoothly, it was a very luxurious trip but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get that same luxury on Saturday. But he broke the track record and came out of the race very well and he\u2019s had a nice break since. I haven\u2019t ridden that many top American dirt horses but the way he performed that night impressed me.\u201d Frosted is a 5-2 chance for the World Cup, behind California Chrome, the 7-4 favourite, while fellow American challengers Mshawish, Hoppertunity and Keen Ice, the only horse to beat American Pharoah last season, are 14-1, 16-1 and 20-1 respectively.", "title": "Charlie Appleby hopes Tryster can start a better year for Godolphin", "sentences": ["The statement of intent has arrived in the run-up to the Dubai World Cup and has often been followed by success for the royal blue colours on the richest card of the year.", "We spoke about a trial and decided that we would go straight to the Guineas.\u201d Appleby\u2019s big hope on Saturday night is Tryster, the winner of last year\u2019s Easter Classic on Good Friday, in the Dubai Turf, one of the season\u2019s most valuable events on grass."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-24T17:18:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/25/roger-federer-doping-crackdown-maria-sharapova-drug-test-miami-open", "tags": ["Roger Federer", "Maria Sharapova", "Tennis", "Drugs in sport", "Sport", "Equal pay"], "article": "Roger Federer has urged the tennis authorities to implement a doping crackdown in the wake of Maria Sharapova failing a drug test. Federer revealed before his return to action from knee surgery here at the Miami Open that, when residing in Dubai where he owns a property and spends about two months a year, he has been tested only once in the past 10 years.   Related: Aljaz Bedene moves into Miami Open second round despite Davis Cup rejection    When in Europe the 34-year-old Swiss is regularly visited by the testers. However, following Sharapova\u2019s admission of using the banned substance meldonium, Federer believes more needs to be done to avert a crisis. \u201cI definitely think that tennis is doing a lot better than we have in the past,\u201d Federer said. \u201cYou could always do more testing. You could ask someone here in 50 years\u2019 time and he\u2019ll say we could still do more. You could be tested four times per day. \u201cWhat is the right amount and what\u2019s not? Clearly, I was very surprised [about Sharapova]; I thought she was going to announce her retirement. But it also shows that the famous players can get caught in the system. \u201cIt seems to be working. I still believe we should keep blood samples for 10 years, so athletes and tennis players know that\u2019s the case, that you could get punished retroactively. I\u2019m a big believer in that. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Dubai for 10 years now and I\u2019ve been tested once in 10 years \u2013 that\u2019s not OK for me. I get tested more in Switzerland because a tester lives in my village. He comes and sees me the day after my surgery and a week later. \u201cIn Dubai they\u2019ve come once because of the Asian games. I\u2019d like it to be the same way and fair. Tennis is doing more and more. It was disappointing to say the least.\u201d Asked if there was a drug problem in tennis, Federer said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Maybe I am naive in the fact that I believe athletes, I trust what they are doing. Clearly, when they get caught you turn because you are like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe that they tried to do that.\u2019 \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a major problem, all I can talk about is myself. I quadruple check anything I take. I don\u2019t want to take any chances whatsoever.\u201d Federer, who revealed the knee surgery he underwent last month was required because of an injury sustained while preparing a bath for his twin daughters, also added his voice to the furore surrounding equal pay in tennis. \u201cIt depends on what tournaments we are talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have got to be very specific about what we are talking about. I\u2019m all for equal prize money. When I was fighting for prize-money increases, especially at the slam level, I was always very aware of the fact that it was always going to impact the women\u2019s game, which I was very happy about both at the same time were growing. \u201cBut then you have to look at the history of each and every event, where it comes from, where a certain tournament was maybe a men\u2019s tournament before or maybe they joined later, or vice versa, so it\u2019s sometimes not easy to make equal prize money there. \u201cIt\u2019s really up to the tournament director to decide if he wants it to be that way. For sure, you could imagine something like that. I\u2019m glad that tennis has produced some of the best female athletes in the world. Equal prize money is a good thing.\u201d Federer plays Juan Martin del Potro on Friday in the second round of the Miami Open \u2013 the world No3\u2019s first tournament appearance since injuring his left knee following his Australian Open defeat by Novak Djokovic in January. He had to undergo arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus and clarified the cause of the problem on the eve of his return. \u201cIt happened the day after the Djokovic match,\u201d said the 17-times grand slam champion. \u201cI woke up, I don\u2019t know exactly remember what happened. I think I was going to run a bath for the girls. I made a very simple movement, turned back, heard a click in my knee. I went to the zoo.

Playing up to every stereotype of magisterial Brits abroad, they ignored the official and tried to re-open the gate to the track themselves. To no one\u2019s great surprise, it did them no good at all. Roger Varian wanted to exercise his Cup runners on the turf that morning, too, but while his fellow trainers seethed and grumbled, he simply redirected the horses on to the main track instead. He got the job done and moved on. In hindsight, it was vintage Varian. The 2011 campaign was his first with a licence and, four seasons later, with more of the same quiet, focused determination, he has grown to become one of the biggest fish in the Newmarket pond. Varian will begin the 2016 season with nearly 200 horses in his yard and could record the most valuable success of his career when he runs Postponed in the Dubai Sheema Classic here on Saturday. Along with Luca Cumani, who trained Postponed to win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot last summer, most racing fans were astonished when Sheikh Mohammed Obaid, the horse\u2019s owner, switched his entire string of about 35 horses to Varian\u2019s Kremlin House Stables last September. Overnight, Cumani lost between a third and half of his string. For Varian, Sheikh Obaid\u2019s decision was equally significant and Postponed promises to be a standard-bearer for the stable this season. If the trainer feels any additional pressure as a result of the sudden, high-profile arrival it does not show. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our business and what we do,\u201d Varian said here this week. \u201cClients move horses occasionally between trainers. It\u2019s happened to me. It\u2019s bigger news because of the profile of some of the horses and the volume of horses but in terms of Newmarket being tight-knit and training within the community, well, I spoke to the people I needed to speak to in the right way before it became public news and I was confident I handled that in the right way. \u201cOnce it becomes public, then people write what they write, but we\u2019re very much running a business and if I wasn\u2019t going to train the horses, someone else would. There\u2019s a hard edge to our business, as there is a lot of businesses. None of us are in a position to be turning down business and, once the horses arrive, you do your very best with them. \u201cOnce you start worrying about outside pressures as a racehorse trainer, it complicates things. It\u2019s not always easy, it\u2019s an emotional game that we\u2019re in, but at the end of the day we can\u2019t change what\u2019s gone and I\u2019m a big believer in looking forward, not back. Live in the present. We\u2019re honest, we do the best that we can, we sleep straight at night, what will be, will be.\u201d In the space of five seasons, Varian has already ticked off Group One wins with juveniles, three-year-olds and older horses, at home and abroad, and also saddled a Classic winner when Kingston Hill took the 2014 St Leger. Victory in the Sheema Classic would be the be another significant step forward simply in terms of the prize money. In 2014, Varian sent out 471 horses and 78 winners in Britain, earning total prize money of \u00a32,252,219, which included \u00a3368,000 for the Leger. If Postponed wins on Saturday he will earn \u00a32,448,000 for the stable in about two and a half minutes. \u201cHe looks like one of the world\u2019s leading horses over a mile and a half and so it\u2019s hugely exciting to have him in the stable,\u201d Varian said. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have him. \u201cOver time, you learn about horses, and I\u2019m very pleased we decided against running him [in the Arc] last autumn. He only moved across town but it always takes a bit of time to settle in to a new home. His preparation has been very straightforward and mentally he\u2019s very uncomplicated.\u201d Varian has realistic prospects of a double in two of the most valuable turf races of the year, as he also runs Intilaaq, the second-favourite, in the Dubai Turf. While Postponed (4.20) looks very solid, Intilaaq may just struggle to contain the exceptional finishing speed of Tryster (3.45). The Dubai World Cup, the richest race of the year, is being run on dirt for the second time at Meydan and seems almost certain to be won by one of the five American challengers. California Chrome, second last year and the Kentucky Derby winner in 2014, will surely start favourite and would be a very popular winner for 78-year-old Art Sherman, but he does not have as much in hand of horses like Frosted and Mshawish (5.00) as the betting might suggest. At the odds, it is Todd Pletcher\u2019s runner who makes most appeal at around 14-1 to follow up his recent win in the Grade One Donn Handicap. Elsewhere on the card, Polar River will be odds-on for the UAE Derby but could be a filly to avoid after an unconvincing performance at odds of 1-14 last time out. Ryan Moore suggested in his Betfair blog this week that Doug Watson\u2019s runner \u201ccomes into season on a regular basis\u201d, which further dampens enthusiasm at around 4-6, though it is still difficult to make a solid case for any of her rivals.

Marco Botti\u2019s six-year-old finished third behind Tryster, who runs in the $6m Dubai Turf at Meydan on Saturday, in last year\u2019s race and set off as the 4-6 favourite to follow up his victory in the Winter Derby over the same course and distance in February. Adam Kirby settled Grendisar on the outside of the field and for a moment it seemed he might struggle to run down Metropol in the straight after the French challenger quickened into the lead. Grendisar found extra inside the final furlong, however, and passed the post a length in front of Fire Fighting, who edged out Metropol for second. Kirby, who like his mount works tirelessly on the all-weather circuit, was winning the feature event of the winter season for the first time. \u201cI can\u2019t explain what it means to me, slogging it out all winter,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cYou put a lot of graft in. \u201cUnfortunately I missed out on the all-weather [jockeys\u2019] championship but it\u2019s just nice to get on to a good horse like this and for him to show how good he is.\u201d Alben Star, first and then second in the All-Weather Sprint Championship in the last two seasons, made it two out of three under a well-judged ride by David Nolan.

The nine-year-old chaser looks the pick of the weights for this staying handicap chase, a series final whose \u00a331,000 to the winner would nearly double Kent\u2019s prize money for the season. Handicap chases have been the making of Gonalston Cloud, who has won all three starts this winter. Though he has climbed two stones in the weights, he has earned that and still looks fairly treated on his revised mark.  That said, he could certainly do with cutting out the mistakes that marred his latest Catterick success but perhaps this flatter track will suit better. Soft ground seems important to him and the forecast says he will get it or something like it. 2.00 Haydock The unsettling \u20180\u2019 in the form-figures next to Five In A Row\u2019s name comes from the novice handicap chase at the Cheltenham Festival, where he never got into the argument. He is hardly the first useful animal to get lost in a hugely competitive contest there but had won his two previous starts over fences this season and may resume his progress in this less threatening environment. 2.15 Kempton After the improvement shown this year by Our Channel, All-Weather Finals Day was under consideration. However, it seems that William Haggas would rather come here for this more winnable contest, the chestnut having seemed to take well to this right-handed circuit when scoring last time. 2.35 Haydock The unexposed youngster Hainan appeals, having improved for the step up in distance to win at Catterick last month. Sue Smith\u2019s grey should appreciate the likely stronger pace here.  2.50 Kempton The obvious one would be Barsanti, a facile winner on his handicap debut last time who will surely not be stopped by a mere 10lb hike. But he will be a short price and has a less experienced jockey aboard for this sterner test, so a chance is taken on Master Of Finance, from the in-form Mark Johnston yard. First time out seems the time to catch this five-year-old, whose only successes in the past two seasons have been on his reappearance. He is far from thrown in but is entitled to be competitive, at the very least, if things fall right. 3.25 Kempton The easy-to-like Spring Loaded is a progressive sprinter, the winner of five of his last seven starts. A 2lb rise for the latest of those successes would not stop him if he was in the same robust health this time. 3.45 Haydock Clyne has seemed in a different league to his rivals in his last two handicap hurdles.

Victor Espinoza, California Chrome\u2019s jockey, said he felt his saddle starting to slip at an early stage but he steered the 2014 Kentucky Derby winner to an emphatic success. The winner powered into the lead halfway down the stretch, and while his saddle was now some way back towards his hindquarters, no encouragement was required from Espinoza as California Chrome coasted to victory ahead of Mubtaahij and Hopportunity. California Chrome finished second behind a surprise winner in the same race 12 months ago, and the $6m (\u00a34.25m) first prize for going one better on Saturday took the five-year-old\u2019s career earnings to $12.5m. It is a record for an American-trained horse, and nearly $4m more than the career total of American Pharoah, the horse Espinoza rode to win the Triple Crown last season. The money, though, will be a secondary concern for the \u201cChromies\u201d, the huge fanbase in the United States that has taken the homespun hero to its heart. Art Sherman, who saddled the winner, became the oldest trainer to win the Kentucky Derby at the age of 77 when California Chrome triumphed two years ago, and though his attempt to win the Triple Crown came up short in the final leg, California Chrome\u2019s popularity has been growing ever since. \u201cAt the second turn I felt the saddle slipping backwards,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cI thought, \u2018uh-oh\u2019. Down the stretch it got worse and worse, and I thought, where\u2019s the wire? \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get out of balance, because it wouldn\u2019t have been pretty. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep my balance without moving my body. I\u2019m just thinking \u2018where\u2019s the wire?\u2019, and it\u2019s not coming fast enough. After winning the Triple Crown, my goal was to win the Dubai World Cup. I was second last year, and it wasn\u2019t much fun.\u201d Sherman, a former jockey who also rode work on Swaps, one of the great Kentucky Derby winners, paid tribute to Espinoza\u2019s skill. \u201cVictor did a fabulous job,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI rode for 23 years, and when your saddle slips it makes you move backwards on a horse, you have to keep control. \u201cHe\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime horse for me, anybody that knows him and has been around him all the years like we have, you really get attached to him. You think about all the great trainers that have never come up with a horse like him.\u201d   Related: California Chrome lives American Dream with Kentucky Derby victory    California Chrome was aimed at Royal Ascot after his second-place finish here last season, only to be scratched from the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes because of injury shortly before the race. This year, however, he may have only two more runs before being retired to stud, with the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in August and then the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, at Santa Anita in November, nominated afterwards as targets by Perry Martin, his part-owner. Roger Varian set himself up for the new European Flat season when Postponed recorded the most valuable win of the trainer\u2019s five-year career with a comprehensive success in the Dubai Sheema Classic. Postponed, who joined Varian\u2019s yard last September following a high-profile split between Sheikh Mohammed Obaid, his owner, and Varian\u2019s fellow Newmarket trainer Luca Cumani, set off as the favourite and was as good as home from the moment he hit the front, halfway down the straight. Postponed powered clear under Andrea Atzeni, who was celebrating his 25th birthday with victory in a race worth \u00a32.5m to the winner, and finished two lengths ahead of Duramente at the post. Varian\u2019s string has expanded rapidly in his relatively brief career with a licence and following the arrival of Postponed, he has a ready-made contender for a string of Group One middle-distance races over the next seven months. \u201cHe deserved to be favourite as a King George winner, but it was a competitive race,\u201d Varian said. \u201cHis campaign will map itself out for him when we get home, the main thing is that he comes out of this in one piece and we won\u2019t make any plans until we can speak to the owner. He\u2019s certainly versatile, and he loves this fast ground.\u201d Ryan Moore rode a flawless race on Real Steel in the Dubai Turf and secured a double for Japanese-trained horses on the night, seizing the initiative a furlong out to beat Euro Charline by half a length with Tryster, the favourite, another two lengths away in third. Moore has forged some impressive alliances in Japan in recent seasons, and took the Japan Cup, the country\u2019s biggest race, on Gentildonna in November 2013. In prize-money terms, however, this was the most valuable success of Moore\u2019s career, worth \u00a33.6m to the winner, and surpassing the purse of around \u00a32m for his wins in the 2010 Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe and 2015 Melbourne Cup. Tryster, last year\u2019s Easter Classic winner on All-Weather Finals Day at Lingfield, was the favourite for the race, but even his exceptional turn of foot could not close the gap to Real Steel after he turned for home at the back of the field. He finished fast into third, while Euro Charline, from Marco Botti\u2019s Newmarket stable, was second. There was an impressive global spread among the winners on the early part of the card, with Australia recording only its third success on World Cup night as Buffering finished three-quarters of a length in front of Ertijaal, the favourite, in the Al Quoz Sprint. Buffering is a veteran of the Australian sprinting scene who made the frame behind the legendary Black Caviar three times in the early part of his career. He was the only horse to travel to the meeting from Australia this year, but was accompanied by a large party of supporters to roar him on and even Meydan\u2019s oversized platform for the presentation ceremonies was barely big enough to accommodate them all. France got on the board in the Dubai Gold Cup when Alain de Royer-Dupr\u00e9\u2019s Vazirabad overcame a slow start to edge past Michael Bell\u2019s Big Orange, fifth home in last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup, well inside the final furlong. This was a Group Two event, but it was still possible to imagine both the winner and runner-up running well in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June. Vazirabad was ultimately a comfortable winner on the night, but he was getting about 5.5lb from Big Orange, and the pair are now top-priced at 8-1 and 16-1 respectively for the royal meeting\u2019s feature event.", "title": "California Chrome storms to stunning win in Meydan\u2019s Dubai World Cup", "sentences": ["California Chrome, a horse from the humblest of origins as the son of a $2,500 sire, overcame a slipping saddle and tore the field apart here on Saturday night to win the $10m Dubai World Cup, the richest race of the season, by three-and-three-quarter lengths in a course record time.", "After winning the Triple Crown, my goal was to win the Dubai World Cup.", "Roger Varian set himself up for the new European Flat season when Postponed recorded the most valuable win of the trainer\u2019s five-year career with a comprehensive success in the Dubai Sheema Classic.", "He\u2019s certainly versatile, and he loves this fast ground.\u201d Ryan Moore rode a flawless race on Real Steel in the Dubai Turf and secured a double for Japanese-trained horses on the night, seizing the initiative a furlong out to beat Euro Charline by half a length with Tryster, the favourite, another two lengths away in third.", "France got on the board in the Dubai Gold Cup when Alain de Royer-Dupr\u00e9\u2019s Vazirabad overcame a slow start to edge past Michael Bell\u2019s Big Orange, fifth home in last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup, well inside the final furlong."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-26T18:30:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/26/lani-kentucky-derby-meydan-uae-derby-dubai-horse-racing", "tags": ["Dubai World Cup", "Kentucky Derby", "Horse racing", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "Lani is a 20-1 chance for the Kentucky Derby \u2013 where she would be the first Japanese-trained winner \u2013 after guaranteeing a place in the field at Churchill Downs on 7 May with victory in the United Arab Emirates Derby here at Meydan on Saturday.

Cigar and Dubai Millennium, the great horses of the race\u2019s early days, were winners at Nad Al Sheba, which was obliterated in 2009 to make way for Meydan. Now the new home has a World Cup winner to stand some comparison. Size is not everything, and the racecourse with a grandstand a mile long needed a winner like California Chrome in its biggest race of the year. Badly. With the honourable exception of Animal Kingdom in 2013, the first half-dozen World Cups at Meydan left many spectators not so much trembling with excitement as wide-eyed with astonishment. Even the move back to dirt 12 months ago did not have an immediate effect on the string of unfathomable results, as Prince Bishop went from tailed-off last to easy winner in an almighty mess of a race. California Chrome was the best horse in the race on Saturday, as he was 12 months ago, when Prince Bishop scorched past him in the stretch. This time he made it count, and with a dramatic flourish for good measure. Victor Espinoza\u2019s saddle had drifted so far south by the closing stages that the jockey was focused only on keeping his balance, yet he still left the course record in tatters. It was a great story to complete the evening, when the races and winners might easily have been picked in advance by Meydan\u2019s marketing department. Victory for California Chrome, the most popular horse in the country which still has the world\u2019s biggest racing industry, was the obvious highlight. This American horse will not be back, but others will follow, with renewed confidence that it is possible to win a $6m (\u00a34.25m) first prize without raceday medication.   Related: California Chrome storms to stunning win in Meydan\u2019s Dubai World Cup    In all, the win prize money on the richest day of the year found its way to four continents. Australia had only its third winner at the meeting when Buffering took the Al Quoz sprint. There was a double for Japan, and winners too for France and Britain, as Roger Varian, the most upwardly mobile trainer in Newmarket, secured the most valuable win of his career with Postponed. Even the least prestigious of the Group Ones, the Golden Shaheen, produced a memorable finish as Muarrab and XY Jet went toe-to-toe all the way up the stretch. The World Cup can be a difficult event to sell to British punters, positioned as it between the two highlights of the domestic season over jumps. Everything seems a little thin the week after Cheltenham. Yet for the majority of racing fans around the world, National Hunt is an oddity, of little or no interest. British racing often frets about the lack of a well-defined opening for its own Flat season, but for most of the major racing countries, in the northern hemisphere at least, Meydan got things off and running rather well. Championships are won in the autumn, and no matter how much money is on offer, a card like Saturday\u2019s can only set the table for the Flat season. This year\u2019s meeting in Dubai could hardly have played that role any better and its winners, and gallant losers, will now spread out around the world to complete their campaigns. Lani will be only the second Japanese-trained horse to line up in the Kentucky Derby after his win-and-you\u2019re-in defeat of Polar River in the UAE Derby. Buffering, a hugely popular sprinter in Australia, could head for Royal Ascot, while California Chrome will head into what will probably be the final two races of his career with a new record for prize-money earnings by a US-trained horse already secure. Michael Bell\u2019s Big Orange, fifth in last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup, gave a strong hint that he will head back to Australia in November with a clear chance to give Britain an overdue first success. The Pacific Classic in August and the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic in November are the races being talked about for California Chrome, who came up only a fraction short behind Bayern and Toast Of New York in the 2014 Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, one of the most thrilling races of recent years. Win or lose in November, his Dubai World Cup will remain as one of the highlights of an outstanding career. Postponed also seems sure to be a central figure as the 2016 season unfolds. For some, his abrupt departure from Luca Cumani\u2019s yard to join Varian in mid-September will remain a sore point, but his new trainer would have been crazy to turn away the business and he now has a ready-made contender for Royal Ascot, the Arc and everything in between. Varian set a new personal record for winners in 2015, but at the same time, picked up less prize money than in 2014, when he took the St Leger with Kingston Hill having seen the same colt finish second in the Derby. If not quite a setback, 2015 was not quite a bold stride forward either. Thanks to his new recruit\u2019s emphatic win in the Sheema Classic, Varian flew home to Newmarket certain that 2016 is already his best season in prize-money terms, before a Flat horse has set foot on a turf track in Britain.

Related: California Chrome triumph will tempt more US horses to Dubai World Cup | Greg Wood    That might have a lot to do with the going at Fairyhouse being unsuitably soft for him, especially since he had top weight there. He still looks unlikely to make the cut for the Aintree version, needing 16 horses above him in the weights to drop out. But it\u2019s interesting that he will at least get the chance to compete if enough horses do withdraw. He was so impressive at the Cheltenham Festival that he\u2019d look a right blot if he did turn up in the National. For today\u2019s Irish National, I shall give another chance to Portrait King (5.00), who at least gets the chance to play a home game for once, having come over to Britain for his last four races. A past winner of the Eider, he again ran well to be third in that race last month, three parts of a length behind Shotgun Paddy, though the well-treated Rocking Blues was in another league. Portrait King also ran huge races in the Becher and the Grand National in the past year, though both times he was a late faller. He\u2019s a contender in any marathon and looks well treated off 130 here, a lower mark than he\u2019s had over fences since he scored at Punchestown 14 months ago. This is one of those races where you need a bit of luck but 33-1 underestimates him in my view. Flat racing on turf gets off to a low-key start for 2016 at Redcar, where the going is heavy after plenty of rain. Among those who may cope well is Eutropius (3.45), a 10-1 shot with a couple of bits of form on soft going, though he was kept to a sounder surface last year.

But after the dust dies down, a new army arrives: that of archaeologists brandishing questions. How much of what has gone should be restored? By what means, and by whom? And where does Palmyra belong, to Syria or the world? For once, there is no doubting the drive. Syria\u2019s director of antiquities, Maamun Abdelkarim, is visiting Palmyra this week to survey the wreckage of his celebrated site, pleading for its rebuilding. His benefactor and Syria\u2019s principal ally, Russia, has compared Palmyra\u2019s restoration with that of Leningrad after the second world war. In Italy, the former culture minister Francesco Rutelli has ambitious plans to use digital \u201cprinting\u201d to reconstruct Palmyra\u2019s fallen temples from their rubble and dust. Private initiatives aren\u2019t far behind. Oxford\u2019s Institute for Digital Archaeology is the creation of American lawyer/archaeologist Roger Michel, with help from Harvard and Dubai. Michel is currently using similar technology to Rutelli\u2019s \u2013 better, he claims \u2013 to build a 3D facsimile arch from Palmyra\u2019s destroyed Temple of Bel. It is to be unveiled in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square on 19 April and will then travel on to New York. \u201cMy intention,\u201d declares Michel, \u201cis to show Islamic State that anything they can blow up we can rebuild exactly as it was before, and rebuild it again and again. We will use technology to disempower Isis.\u201d   Related: Tolerant and multicultural, Palmyra stood for everything Isis hates | Tim Whitmarsh    With the recapture of Palmyra all these ambitions must confront reality. The talk stops and something must happen. New 3D printing technology in particular opens a new front in the old argument among conservationists: between restoration and \u201cconserve as found\u201d, or between treating heritage as \u201cdone and dusted\u201d as opposed to seeing it as an opportunity to discover new meaning, and new enjoyment, in the past. Michel claims his printers can reproduce not just the texture and surface contour of stone but its physical make-up. They can extrude layers of the same sand, water and sodium bicarbonate that formed the artificial stone often used by the ancients. They can reconstitute the original dust of a ruin in situ. It is no different in concept from French archaeologists who, in the last century, re-erected Palmyra\u2019s colonnade. Meanwhile in a quarry in Carrara outside Rome, the decorative features of the Bel temple uprights are being etched by a CNC router-engraver. They are, says Michel, \u201ccompletely indistinguishable from the original\u201d. He is offering the Syrians two printers that, he claims, can operate at a speed that \u201cshould enable us to rebuild what has been destroyed inside six months\u201d. Robotic artificial intelligence can be an aide to art as well as science.           Vision from inside the ancient city of Palmyra after Isis forced out \u2013 video    Michel is backed by London mayor Boris Johnson, an enthusiastic sponsor of the Trafalgar Square arch. Johnson demanded that \u201cBritish archaeologists be in the forefront of the project\u201d, especially given Britain\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d role in failing to defend the site in the first place. David Cameron has yet to respond. In Italy Rutelli\u2019s 12 metre-high Big Delta printer is built by the Wasp Corporation and was first displayed at Rome\u2019s Faire Maker digital fair last year. It has already been used to recreate portions of Pompeii and is being used to recreate the 4 metre-high winged bull of Nimrud in Iraq, smashed by Isis last year. While both Michel and Rutelli are handicapped by the lack of 3D scans of Palmyra, hundreds of photographs coupled with the new accessibility of the ruins should make amends. At this point difficulties arise. First is that of sovereignty. Italy and Britain may have the technical edge, but the Russians are on the ground. Moscow has shown open contempt for the west\u2019s actions in leaving Syria\u2019s army unsupported last year, when it had secured the ruins against Isis. For fear of seeming to back President Assad, American and British air cover was denied him, and the Syrians had to retreat. Isis moved in and began its orgy of destruction. The director of the Hermitage museum, Mikhail Piotrovsky, has no intention of relinquishing Russia\u2019s triumph. Last week he declared: \u201cWe will never find anything more beautiful in the annals of Russian history in the Middle East\u201d than the liberation of Palmyra. His museum already houses a collection of artefacts from the city, including the Silk Road\u2019s \u201cPalmyra Tariff\u201d, round which the museum has built a computerised market place. With Putin\u2019s explicit support, Piotrovsky sees Russia\u2019s \u201creconstruction and restoration\u201d of the temples as a project \u201cto raise the spirit of not only the Syrian people but of all mankind\u201d. The Palmyra ruins are supposedly under the aegis of Unesco as a \u201cworld heritage site\u201d. Few hold out much hope that this body, to whom all parties pay lip service, will be an agile party to what happens next. With security uncertain and Syria\u2019s government beholden not to the west but to Russia, the likelihood is that Unesco will retreat into its familiar indecision and bickering. It has already fallen back on what it does best, summoning a conference later in the spring. So far Unesco\u2019s director, Irina Bokova, has struggled to hold the ring. She spoke at the weekend to Putin, who promised to de-mine the Palmyra site and send experts from the Hermitage. Where that leaves Italy\u2019s current culture minister, Dario Franceschini, is unclear. He claims to have a unit of 60 \u201cblue helmets for culture\u201d on standby to protect the site. Also champing at the bit are Michel and Rutelli, both with their machines at the ready, though Michel appears to have his dispositions most in place. He is proposing to bring his arch direct to Palmyra after London and New York and erect it near the site as a demonstration of what can be done. He is determined that his 3D machines be available to rebuild the new town as well as the old. At present Palmyra is reportedly a ghost town, its population forced to drive east by the retreating Isis. The danger is that, if Abdelkarim does not see his temples rebuilt in the current wave of enthusiasm, the moment will pass. Palmyra could then sink into the same looting and decay as have afflicted Iraq\u2019s monuments since 2003 \u2013 and the indecision that hovers over Afghanistan. In the latter case, the sixth-century Bamiyan buddhas, destroyed by the Taliban, have lain in rubble since 2001. When western forces subsequently liberated the country, the new Afghan government and the local Hazara people pleaded for the statues to be reinstated. They had been much restored before and were much-loved and a potential tourist site. Initially German archaeologists began reconstruction, under the conservation NGO, ICOMOS. Unesco intervened, an argument ensued and work was stopped. A decade of fruitless debate resulted in a 2012 Unesco order that any work on the site would be \u201cinauthentic\u201d.     Top: the Temple of Bel in March 2014. Bottom: the same site two years later. Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP/Getty Images    It added none the less that it was in principle \u201cneither for nor against reconstruction\u201d. Le Monde reported \u201cendless dithering, underhand rivalry, pointless discord and mistakes\u201d in Unesco\u2019s handling of the site. Similar feuding enveloped the reconstruction of Cambodia\u2019s Angkor Wat following the ousting of the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1990s. After the destruction of the second world war, the Council of Europe evolved what amounted to a new ideology towards heritage. It should be stabilised and \u201cconserved as found\u201d. The Victorians might rebuild, but the 20th century should enshrine its destructive urges as memorials. The Romantics\u2019 cult of the ruin was reborn as a cult of penitence. This \u201cmodernist\u201d approach infused Britain\u2019s failure to restore the towns destroyed in the Blitz. It had less impact on defeated nations, frantic to repair the emotional wounds of war by rediscovering the familiar from the past. French, German and Polish cities struggled to rebuild what bombs had destroyed, witness Caen, Dresden and Warsaw. As a result, Germany\u2019s destroyed but rebuilt town of Lubeck is now a world heritage site; Britain\u2019s Coventry certainly is not. What in most of Europe was seen as recovered memory was in England seen as meaningless nostalgia. At least in matters of archaeology, the British approach won. The reconstruction in the 1900s of Minoan Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans was never to be repeated. The sheer nihilism of what Isis has done in Iraq and Syria may yet shift the terms of this debate. Why should the forces of darkness be allowed to determine what we may experience of the past? The former British Museum expert John Curtis, doyen of Iraq\u2019s ruined sites, declares himself ready to welcome Michel and others to Palmyra. \u201cMany of these ruins had been restored over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cProvided we know exactly what we are doing, I would certainly favour restoring them to what they were a year ago.\u201d Curtis can add more than a hundred sites and shrines in Iraq that appear to have gone for good, and might be added to Michel\u2019s list.   Related: Palmyra \u2013 what the world has lost    They include \u201call the Christian churches in Mosul, most of the monasteries \u2013 some of the earliest Christian sites in the world\u201d. He offers as a starter for reconstruction the ancient al-Arbain mosque in Tikrit, \u201cthen Nimrud, then perhaps Hatra, almost entirely a rebuild before its destruction by Isis\u201d. In Syria perhaps the greatest task lies in Aleppo. Its ancient Silk Road market lies in ruins, as does the great Umayyad mosque and its 11th-century minaret, felled by artillery in 2013. Not to rebuild the minaret would be as unthinkable as to not to have rebuilt St Mark\u2019s campanile in Venice after its collapse in 1902. In this, archaeologists still seem to have a terror of \u201cgoing back too far\u201d. Curtis finds restoration \u201cafter overnight destruction\u201d fine, but \u201cso far and no further\u201d. It seems likely that Unesco would take the same view. It is hard to imagine what it would make of the renewal of Gothic cathedrals and abbeys in 19th-century Europe. It leaves out of account Chinese and Japanese historicism, which rebuilds constantly, finding meaning in design and setting rather than in physical fabric \u2013 and finding none in ruins. The possibility is now that 3D printing technology can restore whole swaths of 20th-century ruination. It can recapture artistry and a sense of place, much as photography can recapture forgotten faces and disseminate great paintings. Of course it is a \u201ccopy\u201d and thus lacks \u201cauthenticity\u201d, but so what? Photography did not die for want of authenticity. The west has visited political and military catastrophe on the Middle East. The obligation to rectify that seems overwhelming. Even now, western (and Saudi Arabian) jets are pulverising the ancient Arab city of Sana\u2019a in Yemen. More recently, drones and manned bombers have been targeting Isis-related sites in northern Libya. That coastline is probably the richest resource of undiscovered archaeology in the Mediterranean. Deep-action munitions can destroy any site in seconds. Are steps being taken even now to record what our bombers ape Isis in destroying? This is a world that dates from the earliest eras of classical, Christian and Muslim cultures. It is everyone\u2019s heritage. Perhaps from these wars could emerge the greatest enterprise of historical revival since 1945. In the regions concerned, there seems a craving for normality, to put back the clock on the destruction wrought by Isis. The obstacle is not the will or the means. Both are now present in abundance. The obstacle could yet be an inability on the part of so many enthusiasts to work together, and an obtuse academic dismissal of a technology that can release to the world a new delight in the past.", "title": "After Palmyra, the message to Isis: what you destroy, we will rebuild | Simon Jenkins", "sentences": ["Oxford\u2019s Institute for Digital Archaeology is the creation of American lawyer/archaeologist Roger Michel, with help from Harvard and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-29T07:00:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/29/andy-murray-exhausted-annabel-croft-miami-open-tennis", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "Andy Murray looks an \u201cexhausted\u201d player, according to the former British No1 Annabel Croft.

I arrive in Spain and the pain was similar, or a little bit more, so we decided to do a proper check.\u201d As to whether he will race in China on 17 April, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not 100% certain. There will be another test in the next eight or 10 days and after that the FIA will evaluate. I have been very lucky all my career. This is my 16th season and it is normal you have accidents here and there. It happened unfortunately in the last two years, two accidents that I miss a race.\u201d Alonso missed what would have been his McLaren debut in Australia last year after suffering concussion following a crash during testing in Barcelona. Reflecting on last week\u2019s crash, he said: \u201cI did not feel any risk at all in the middle of the accident. My only concern when I was rolling over was to avoid hitting the head. There have been some painful days at home. At the end of the day the pain is manageable, if you don\u2019t think too much.\u201d Alonso lives in nearby Dubai and McLaren told him he could go home but he preferred to stay with the team. \u201cI will help Stoffel, because it is a big opportunity for him,\u201d he said. Button is looking forward to racing against Vandoorne. \u201cHe is going to be busy over the next few days but this team is very good to new drivers. I am sure it\u2019s going to be a whirlwind and he will be busy but he will be fine. I think he will be quick, only nobody knows how quick.\u201d Kevin Magnussen, the Renault driver who has raced for McLaren, thinks Vandoorne is capable of matching the 36-year-old Button. \u201cHe is good enough to be in Formula 1 so he will have a good race, I\u2019m sure. I know he deserves to be here, so I\u2019m happy to see he got a shot.\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel said Formula One should not feel proud of the decision to retain its controversial elimination qualifying for Bahrain. The system made its debut in Australia and was unanimously criticised by the teams after the farce of Q3, in which no cars ran for four minutes. Vettel said: \u201cI am as disappointed as probably anyone I know that we didn\u2019t go back. Put it this way: if you sell vanilla ice cream but everybody who comes to your shop is asking for chocolate ice cream and the next day you open, you expect to sell chocolate ice cream but instead you just sell vanilla ice cream again. \u201cUsually you do what your clients would like you to do but you are not really doing the job if you do the exact opposite. It\u2019s something that we can\u2019t be proud of. If everybody is against something and you still decide for it \u2026 qualifying is just one example that something is not right.\u201d Vettel, speaking on behalf of the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association, added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t give any proposals [in our recent letter]. We made it clear there\u2019s something not right and something has to change. I think our intention was that we really questioned the situation or decision-making and hopefully we can improve that in the future.\u201d", "title": "Fernando Alonso to miss Bahrain Grand Prix due to Melbourne crash injuries", "sentences": ["At the end of the day the pain is manageable, if you don\u2019t think too much.\u201d Alonso lives in nearby Dubai and McLaren told him he could go home but he preferred to stay with the team."], "publicationDate": "2016-03-31T10:51:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/01/premier-league-run-in-every-club", "tags": ["Premier League", "Arsenal", "Aston Villa", "Bournemouth", "Chelsea", "Crystal Palace", "Everton", "Leicester City", "Liverpool", "Manchester City", "Newcastle United", "Manchester United", "Norwich City", "Southampton", "Stoke City", "Sunderland", "Swansea City", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Watford", "West Bromwich Albion", "West Ham United", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Arsenal What they need to do to have a successful end to the season Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and his team have no further margin for error and, above all, they must show the mental strength that he constantly rabbits on about \u2013 in the face of mounting supporter unrest.

Key player Mesut \u00d6zil David Hytner Aston Villa What they need to do Twelve points adrift with seven matches remaining, Villa need a miracle.

Photograph: Nick Potts/PA    Bournemouth What they need to do It is essentially job done for Bournemouth but Eddie Howe will not allow his side to end the season with a whimper. Last week\u2019s training camp to Dubai ought to have reinvigorated any of the more tired legs in the squad given the tricky run in ahead. Joshua King has come to the fore again of late, possibly buoyed by Callum Wilson\u2019s return to training while Simon Francis and Steve Cook have made remarkable progress as a centre-back pairing. Success at this stage It\u2019s still all about survival Key player Joshua King Ben Fisher  Chelsea What they need to do The season can not be properly redeemed but blooding a few of the kids in the weeks ahead, and beating Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur (in particular) to assist Leicester\u2019s title challenge, might generate some enthusiasm before the arrival of Antonio Conte Success at this stage \u201cSuccess\u201d is beyond them, but a top-seven finish might save some face if there is also some evidence of forward-planning Key player Ruben Loftus-Cheek Dominic Fifield     Chelsea\u2019s Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Diego Costa. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters    Crystal Palace What they need to do Muster enough points to stave off the increasing threat of relegation after a 13-match winless run in the Premier League, while also reaching the second FA Cup final in their history. To do that they will have to nurse James McArthur and Jason Puncheon back to fitness, and try and get a run of games out of Connor Wickham. Success at this stage Survival and a Cup final appearance Key player Jason Puncheon DF Everton  What they need to do Not even a consistent run of wins and clean sheets could turn this Premier League campaign into a success for Everton, though Roberto Mart\u00ednez would insist otherwise. Eight league defeats at Goodison Park \u2013 one more than in the brush with relegation under Howard Kendall in 1998 \u2013 and the most league goals conceded at home \u2013 three more than Aston Villa \u2013 are the obvious weaknesses to address. Success at this stage Winning the FA Cup is the only thing that can redeem this season for Mart\u00ednez Key player Romelu Lukaku Andy Hunter     Romelu Lukaku has been a shining light in a disappointing season for Everton. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX/Shutterstock    Leicester City  What they need to do The big question is whether Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team can handle the pressure at the top when it really starts to be cranked up. So far, so good. Keeping Mahrez, Kant\u00e9 and Vardy fit is essential, and that Huth and Morgan partnership is also key. Success at this stage You mean it\u2019s not been a success already? OK, winning the title. Key player Riyad Mahrez SJ Liverpool What they need to do The late collapse at Southampton before the international break encapsulated Liverpool\u2019s season and J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s frustration. Just when the team appear to have clicked \u2013 defensively and in attack \u2013 they regress, although pre-St Mary\u2019s form had fuelled belief in a concerted challenge for European qualification. More is required from central midfield. Success at this stage A consistent run reflecting the development of Klopp\u2019s style. Champions League qualification via a Europa League triumph would not go amiss either. Key player Philippe Coutinho AH     Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, and his key man, Philippe Coutinho. Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images    Manchester City What they need to do Be shaken from their slumber and made to realise Champions League football could be missed unless they put a run together. If Joe Hart misses only one league game due to his injury sustained in the derby and Kevin De Bruyne can return for the last seven or eight matches, City can surely do what is required.

This front four would have the pace and goals United miss too often. Success at this stage A top-four finish Key player At the moment, Marcus Rashford JJ     Marcus Rashford has made an outstanding start to his Manchester United career. Photograph: Jon Super/AP    Newcastle United What they need to do Become more direct. Seemingly incapable of passing through opponents, this team is better suited to counter-attacking. More quality crosses are required and, possibly, a switch to 4-4-2. Moussa Sissoko could provide an unlikely answer to the problem vacancy at left-back and Cheick Tiot\u00e9 may need to be recalled in order to anchor midfield and protect a dangerously under-staffed defence. Success at this stage Survival Key player Papiss Ciss\u00e9 Louise Taylor Norwich City What they need to do Four points and two clean sheets in their last two games have slowed Norwich\u2019s hurtle towards the abyss. The January signing Timm Klose has been excellent at centre-back and now they need to add greater cutting edge for the final six weeks. Is Steven Naismith, underwhelming on the whole since his high-profile arrival, now match-fit enough to make the difference and could Patrick Bamford rescue his own season of arrested development? They may have to. Success at this stage Any finish above 18th place \u2013 no matter how close a call Key player Steven Naismith Nick Ames     Can January arrivals Timm Klose and Steven Naismith keep Norwich up? Photograph: Craig Brough/Reuters    Southampton  What they have to do Ronald Koeman\u2019s team have been very good since the middle of January and, happily for them, they have key players coming into form such as Fraser Forster and Graziano Pell\u00e8. Concentration over the full 90 minutes, during a tricky run-in, will be vital. Comeback victories like the 3-2 over Liverpool will not happen every weekend. Success at this stage Europa League qualification Key player Graziano Pell\u00e8 DH Stoke City  What they need to do to Having lost only one of their past six league games, Stoke must pick up after the international break where they left off \u2013 although several key injuries, most notably Jack Butland\u2019s fractured ankle, will not help. Stoke\u2019s best performances have come when Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic have clicked and that partnership will need to be firing again for the April games with Liverpool, Spurs and Man City.

Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images    Sunderland What they need to do Wrap Jermain Defoe in cotton wool between games. Keep the impressive Jan Kirchhoff patrolling the zone between midfield and defence. Make the very best of Wahbi Khazri\u2019s stellar set-piece delivery. Decide whether Youn\u00e8s Kaboul or John O\u2019Shea is Lamine Kon\u00e9\u2019s best central defensive partner. Keep Lee Cattermole on the bench. Success at this stage Survival Key player Jermain Defoe LT Swansea City  What they have to do Alberto Paloschi could do with a goal or two, it would be nice to see Modou Barrow build on some promising performances, and for Gylfi Sigurdsson, Swansea\u2019s best player, to sign off for the Euros with a flourish. In other news, what on earth happened to Jefferson Montero? Success at this stage 11th (top of the bottom half) Key player Gylfi Sigurdsson SJ     Any idea where on earth Jefferson Montero is? Photograph: Ian Kington/AFP/Getty Images    Tottenham Hotspur  What they have to do This is nosebleed territory for Tottenham but a young team have shown no sign of nerves or fatigue. With 25 points from the last available 30, they have momentum and the belief that they can beat anybody. They must concentrate on what they can control but how they could come to regret that 1-0 home defeat to Leicester City in January. Success at this stage Champions League qualification would be a magnificent achievement but they want more Key player Harry Kane DH Watford What they they need to do It would be good to find a means of regularly scoring other than Troy Deeney flicking or looping balls forward for Odion Ighalo to run on to. The Moroccan winger Nordin Amrabat looks the most likely to provide one, though moving Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado permanently infield, or off it entirely, might also help. Success at this stage It has already been achieved, but at least one more league win and an FA Cup final appearance would crown it Key player Nordin Amrabat Simon Burnton     Can Watford find a way of scoring that doesn\u2019t involve Troy Deeney flicking or looping balls forward for Odion Ighalo to run on to? Photograph: Stephen Pond/Getty Images    West Bromwich Albion What they they need to do Pulis being Pulis, it is still all about getting to 40 points (they are one shy). Darren Fletcher mentioned 50 points a few weeks ago and was reprimanded by his manager live on air. Albion have a tough run-in but Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and Saido Berahino, on their day, are a handful. Success at this stage Breaking through the 50-point barrier for the first time Key player Saido Berahino SJ West Ham United  What they they need to do After months of injuries, Slaven Bilic is likely to have a fully fit squad for the visit of Palace on Saturday and the feelgood factor around Upton Park should grow even stronger if it stays that way Success at this stage Finishing fourth and winning the FA Cup Key player Dimitri Payet Jacob Steinberg     Is a fourth-placed finish and an FA Cup win beyond West Ham?

And it is with this in mind that we line up the lame, Championship-bound duck that is Aston Villa in our crosshairs, to greet the news that, far from being punished for going on an ill-advised holiday where he was pictured sucking on a shisha pipe in Dubai during the international break, Gabby Agbonlahor has been rewarded with the prize of having no place in the Aston Villa squad set to have further humiliation heaped upon them by Chelsea tomorrow, while the club launch an internal investigation into his behaviour. Should the investigation in question be staged in the same ruthlessly efficient manner as everything else at Aston Villa, Agbonlahor has every right to feel confident that those conducting the investigation will decide the photographic evidence of one of their players having a good time in Dubai at this difficult time is inconclusive and what looks suspiciously like Agbonlahor sucking on a shisha pipe, an entirely legal activity, could conceivably be a member of the Birmingham Philharmonic playing the oboe. Micah Richards, who in a perhaps-unintentional-but-comical-nonetheless demonstration of the complete absence of morale that is the hallmark of this Villa side, was also in Dubai but on a different holiday to his team-mate, and has not been so lucky and will have to front up against Chelsea. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the decision from the footballing side to remove him from the squad just for this game, purely because I don\u2019t want anything to distract the players and their surroundings for the game,\u201d said caretaker manager Eric Black, who has been in his new role for less than three days but already sounds incoherent and at the end of his tether. In other news pertaining to Villa, mild-mannered long-time local lad, Villa fan and former player Stan Collymore has launched his manifesto [Stanifesto? - Fiver Ed] for immediate change at the club he loves. Weighing in at 1,817 words (although considerably shorter if you take out the bits where he admits to understanding why some people might not think he is the ideal person for the job of getting wayward young lads to behave or helping to whip a badly run football club back into some sort of shape), Stan\u2019s blueprint for a better Villa is chock full of bright, if fairly obvious, ideas that shouldn\u2019t really have been beyond the wit of those being handsomely paid to run the club in the first place. Whether or not Stan is the man to help usher the club into a brand new Championship dawn remains to be seen, but it\u2019s inconceivable that he could do a worse job than the bunch of dunderheads currently doing their damnedest to run the club into the ground.

Before the dark days of the civil war, it was used nostalgically, as a brake on those \u2013 the young, the daring, the dangerously modern \u2013 who had no use for the outmoded past: for its narrow streets, crowded souks and tiny workshops. But since 2011, when the troubles began, it has taken on an altogether more painful meaning. With so much of the country destroyed, what will the future look like? People close their eyes, and they wonder: is it even possible to imagine such a thing? Marwa al-Sabouni believes it is \u2013 and her eyes are wide open. A 34-year-old architect and mother of two, Sabouni was born and grew up in Homs, scene of some of the most vicious fighting. Unlike many, however, she did not leave Syria \u2013 or even Homs itself \u2013 during the war. The practice she and her husband still (in theory) run together on the old town\u2019s main square was shut up almost immediately: this part of the city quickly became a no-go area. But her home nearby somehow survived intact, and her family safe inside it. \u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to leave my home. We were stuck there, as if we were in prison; we didn\u2019t see the moon for two years. But apart from broken windows there was no other damage.\u201d She laughs, relishing my astonishment at this (we\u2019re talking on Skype, which feels so strange, the cars in her street honking normality \u2013 or a version of it \u2013 with their horns). \u201cYes! We visited Damascus three months ago, and people there were just as amazed as you. Do I seem crazy because I\u2019m laughing? Well, I do consider myself lucky. I have a wonderful husband who\u2019s so optimistic, and that, and our spiritual lives, helped us. This journey that is life: it comes with the hard, and the easy. We looked at it as something that would make us better in the end. I haven\u2019t seen a shrink\u2026 yet. But, you know, I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m still a normal person inside.\u201d    I haven\u2019t seen a shrink\u2026 yet. But, you know, I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m still a normal person inside    How did they cope? \u201cThere were different stages, and with each one there were new things to deal with. First were the demonstrations. You heard the voices, and the clashes, and that was disturbing. Then there were the battles; you heard shots in the street, and you didn\u2019t know what was happening \u2013 it was the first time you\u2019d ever heard gunfire. We used to joke about it. You\u2019d think you\u2019d open your door the next morning, and nothing would be left. But in fact, everything would be fine. \u2018Where did they go,\u2019 you\u2019d wonder. \u201cAfter that there was the bombing, the planes and the tanks at the end of the street. You\u2019d hear the buildings collapsing, and it was very frightening. There were lots of snipers here; they controlled our area from all sides. Too many people died, like birds. You\u2019d be walking in the street, and someone would fall next to you. It was\u2026 very hard. Not every city suffered such great misfortune as ours, and there is still a part of Homs that is besieged even now.\u201d Were she and her husband \u2013 it seems stupid even to ask \u2013 able to work? \u201cNo. For two years we did nothing.\u201d What about the children? \u201cThey were home-schooled for a couple of months, but after that they went to school.\u201d And now? \u201cI\u2019ve taken a teaching job at a university in Hama [a city north of Homs]. It\u2019s 30km away. It used to take 20 minutes to drive. Now you have to go around the new territory [a euphemism for land under the control of Islamic State and other forces opposed to the Syrian government; everyone uses these euphemisms]. It takes two hours each\u00a0way.\u201d Is it safe? \u201cHmm. It depends how you define safe. No, it\u2019s not. Nothing has happened yet, but it could at any moment. Only a small area around the road is controlled by the government, so opposing forces could come in at any moment. But it has to be done, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Since the ceasefire \u2013 late in 2015, the last of the major rebel forces finally withdrew from the city \u2013 Homs has largely been quiet. But it is absolutely changed: the old city, where its market stood, is gone, and 60% of its other neighbourhoods are little more than rubble: \u201cThe destruction is beyond imagination.\u201d So if she wants to buy bread or oranges, where does she go? \u201cPeople have just moved a little, into the residential areas. On the streets there are metal sheds, and the market stall holders are in those. Beneath my apartment there is a carpenter, a carwash, a sweetshop. People are working all sorts of jobs to get by. My husband juggles four or five. Accountants are working at the market, and mechanical engineers as taxi drivers. Before the war, Homs was famous for its lack of homeless people, thanks to its Islamic charities. But now the streets are filled with them. People outside think our most difficult challenges are weapon-related. But the truth is that the hospitals, which have no proper equipment, are killing more people now than bullets.\u201d     The battle-scarred Khalid ibn al-Walid mosque looms in front of the devastated city of Homs. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    And what of the city\u2019s heritage? Though relatively little of ancient Homs was still in existence even before the war, it was noted for two important landmarks, both in the neighbourhood of al-Hamidyah: the Ottoman Khalid ibn al-Walid mosque, part of whose carved wooden minbar was commissioned by Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi (AKA Saladin), and the Church of St Mary of the Holy Belt, reputedly the world\u2019s oldest church and the home of the relic after which it is named (though reconstructed in the mid-19th century, it dates originally from AD50). Both have been badly damaged in the war, and the minbar looted \u2013 though the Virgin\u2019s belt, traditionally carried through the streets on 15 August, is reported to be safe in an undisclosed location. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to either,\u201d says Sabouni. \u201cNo one is permitted to. But from what I\u2019m hearing, not even the UN organisations responsible for the restoration of Old Homs are being allowed to have a say about materials, expertise, etc.\u201d It\u2019s the same at Krak des Chevaliers, the crusader castle 40km west of Homs that is a Unesco world heritage site. \u201cThey [the authorities] weren\u2019t telling anyone they had done anything to the place. But it has started. My husband visited, and saw it, the restoration work. It has been done in haste. It\u2019s to do with sending messages, I think.\u201d Her feelings about all this \u2013 the restoration of what remains of Syria, and rebuilding what doesn\u2019t \u2013 are complicated. As we speak, it is only 24 hours since the Syrian government announced it had recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra, another Unesco world heritage site, whose temples Isis destroyed, and whose museum it turned into a courtroom. But she can\u2019t match the ecstasy of Maamoun Abdelkarim, Syria\u2019s director of antiquities, who claimed it as the second happiest day of his life, or share the somewhat glib relief of those here who are already extolling the virtues of its immediate reconstruction using digital technology (Boris Johnson is one, Simon\u00a0Jenkins\u00a0another). Partly, this is because she can\u2019t help but think of Palmyra\u2019s desperate inhabitants: \u201cI was concerned for the people there, caught in the crossfire, no doctors to help them. We\u2019ve been hearing terrible things.\u201d But there\u2019s more to it than this. \u201cDo you want me to be honest? I don\u2019t know how I feel about it. I visited Palmyra when I was at school, and even then I saw the electrical wiring around the columns, the new carving of names on ancient stones, the disorganised urbanism, tourism and restoration. It was so neglected. It had no protection, out there in the desert. You could jump on it, climb on it. Take a look at a picture of the so-called museum: the fake ceiling, the metal cage of a door. Part of me thinks it was better that it was destroyed.\u201d She stops, taken aback by her own vehemence. Then goes on: \u201cI understand why the west is emotional about it. But when you are living here, you have a different angle.\u201d Sabouni carefully outlines her fierce attitude to the crucial role architecture will play in the future of Syria, should the peace hold, in her extraordinary memoir, The Battle for Home, which will be published here this month. As if its existence were not a miracle enough \u2013 she wrote it as the bombs dropped around her, and then researched possible homes for it on the internet \u2013 it comes with a foreword by the philosopher Roger Scruton, who describes its author, not without reason, as one of the most remarkable people he has ever met. Of course, their acquaintance is only virtual at this point. Two years ago Sabouni wrote to Scruton out of the blue from Homs, asking him to explain something in his book, The Aesthetics of Architecture. He was amazed. Who was this person so \u201ceccentric\u201d as to devote time to architectural aesthetics when all around her \u201cthe fabric of her ancient city\u201d was falling in ruins? He wrote back immediately, and they became correspondents. What does he think of her book? It is, he writes, not only \u201cthe work of a profound thinker\u201d but also \u201cthe expression of a beautiful soul, who comes to us with\u2026 a message of hope\u201d. I\u2019m not sure about the hope, for all that I find Sabouni herself more inspiring that I can say. Her book\u2019s central message \u2013 that Syria\u2019s built environment played a contributory role in the war itself because too many people were living in what were effectively sectarian ghettoes, and that the government must not repeat this mistake when it rebuilds \u2013 seems almost certain to fall on deaf ears, assuming that anyone hears it in the first place (it has not been published in Arabic). But still, there is no doubting that her arguments are both important and acute. As she notes, for the most part, Middle Eastern architecture in the 21st century comes in only two guises: the Dubai model, soulless and suitable only for the rich, and the ersatz Islamic model, which consists mostly of a rectangular block on top of whose flat roof a dome may or may not have been dropped, \u201clike a hat\u201d. Too many older buildings have been unloved, pulled down or left to rot, while new buildings have consisted only of so much grey concrete, and this has contributed to what she regards as a loss of identity and, perhaps, of self-respect. \u201cThe lack of beauty, the promise of a good life that architecture can inspire\u2026 The old city of Homs used to be known as \u2018the mother of the poor\u2019. You didn\u2019t need money to live there. It was a place of trees, and jasmine and fruit. But then the new city, with its corruption and its modern blocks, developed over it, bringing with it a lack of hope, despair.\u201d     Reduced to rubble: a Syrian flag flutters outside a military barracks in the devastated Baba Amr neighbourhood. Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP/Getty Images    On her daily journey to Hama, Sabouni passes through the rubble of the Old Town, a sight so distressing, she hardly knows where to look. Yet she can\u2019t help but notice that its very ruins seem to illustrate her thesis. \u201cEven the plants recognise it! The old buildings have yellow flowers and grass growing from their basalt stones. But the new cement buildings have no flowers, no grass. They\u2019re like corpses, while the old buildings are somehow still alive.\u201d It worries her that the government, in the rush to rebuild, has no clear strategy in place. \u201cWe have so many challenges ahead. The need is urgent, both in terms of providing people with homes, and bringing back to us all a part of what we have lost. But what we lost wasn\u2019t right in the first place. I strongly believe that. In some ways, it led us here. We traded the values of our old Islamic architecture for the profligate consumer model, and in the process we lost ourselves.\u201d Sabouni, whose father is a doctor, didn\u2019t start out wanting to be an architect. \u201cIn Syria our grades qualify us for certain majors, and beyond this, you don\u2019t get much choice. The highest grades qualify for medicine, below that is dentistry and pharmacy, and below that the engineering disciplines including architecture. Well, I scored for that, and I was disappointed not to have done better.\u201d    Hope is blind, and always manages to find its way into the human heart, mine included    How long did it take her to get interested once she\u2019d started the course? \u201cTwo months!\u201d Her book describes the lacklustre teaching at her architectural school; students often ended up copying their designs from magazines. It was obvious, moreover, that there was little future for any of them \u2013 the best they could hope for was a role as a draughtsman \u2013 and, sure enough, her first job after graduation was miserable. Having paid no bribes, and being in possession of no influential \u201cconnections\u201d, she was left to clock-watch in a tedious state office. \u201cI had no illusions of being the next Zaha Hadid,\u201d she writes. \u201cNevertheless, hope is blind, and always manages to find its way into the human heart, mine included.\u201d Having moved to the architectural office at the administrative headquarters of the city university, she was thrilled to be invited to design furniture for some of its dormitories. Ignoring the bafflement of her colleagues, who wanted only to pick up their paychecks, she threw herself into it, poring over her sketches the moment she arrived at her desk. But it was no good. Her ideas were rejected, and without any explanation. So she left, and she and her husband, also an architect, set up together (her husband is from Baba Amr, one of the first areas in Homs to rise up against Assad, and now a \u201cmetonym for either unprecedented courage or high treason, depending on whose side you are on\u201d; they went against their families to marry, and in 2011, just as the troubles began, and he was on his way to Kuwait to pick up an award for his online architecture portal, he was arrested and briefly imprisoned, simply for the fact of his birthplace). Was it easy to get work? \u201cCommissions from private individuals, and that may also involve interior design, can be a good source of income. But the building code here is old and restrictive and limiting to creativity. It doesn\u2019t work for anyone except the real estate people.\u201d And then the war came.     Marwa al-Sabouni\u2019s vision of \u2018tree units\u2019 for the redevelopment of the razed district of Baba Amr. Photograph: \u00a9 Marwa al-Sabouni, 2016    After four years of fighting, she and her husband went back to Old Homs, along with crowds of other returnees, to take a look at their abandoned studio, this place into which they had put all their dreams. She expected the bullet cases and sandbags, the stench of smoke. What she didn\u2019t expect was \u201cthe madness that filled the scorched air\u201d. People were, she says, behaving like tourists, taking photographs of themselves in the remains: \u201cI felt the most powerful curiosity I have felt in my life.\u201d Around her, people gathered inconsequential belongings \u2013 a broken picture frame, a gas cylinder, a sweater \u2013 and it was this, in the end, that turned the unsettling cheer into anger. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough that your home had been destroyed; it began to feel like a further insult that you had to be humiliated by digging up trivial things just to remind you of who you were.\u201d As the days went by, looting began. In part, her book grew from this collective madness, from the need to know how hitherto peaceful communities could descend into what she calls \u201canimal carnage\u201d. Architecture, she thinks, can provide part of the answer. In 2010, 9 million Syrians \u2014 close to half of the population \u2014 were living in slums and informal housing. It is, she says, alarming to see history repeating itself, before the cycle of violence has even burned itself out. The government, for instance, is rebuilding Christian areas (Christians are supportive of the Alawite regime, a minority that defends them, another minority), but not Sunni ones (the enemy). Some Sunnis have been prevented even from returning to live in the rubble of their homes. Such discrimination recalls both the Ottoman and, later, French rule of Syria, when, for instance, Christian communities were also favoured by corrupt regimes. No good came out of that, either. But, still. She has hope. She can\u2019t keep it down. In her book she reveals a plan she drew up for razed Baba Amr, a scheme she entered in a UN-Habitat competition. Its gentleness and sense of community \u2013 it comprises \u201ctree units\u201d: shops and community spaces in their trunks, apartments with private courtyards on their branches \u2013 is powerfully at odds with the government\u2019s ideas, which involve freestanding towers. The authorities, of course, rejected it, but the positive reaction to it online has encouraged\u00a0her.     The Dubai option: official plans for the rebuilding of Baba Amr.    And then, so casually, she drops it in. \u201cMy husband and I have opened a bookshop in Homs,\u201d she says. \u201cWe sell books from Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and Wylie. It\u2019s small, but the reaction has been amazing. People can\u2019t afford to buy. Books are so expensive, and our currency is broken. But they come in anyway, and they thank us. \u2018It\u2019s about time Homs had something like this,\u2019 they say. You can feel how desperate people are to be to be treated with respect, for their minds.\u201d One way or another, things will get better. She believed this through the darkest days, and she believes it now. \u201cI hope my voice will be heard in the end,\u201d she says. From outside her window, a taxi loudly sounds its agreement.

The school had received a grant from the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, for improvements, which prompted the board of education, the local council and families in the area to raise 20,000 SDG (around \u00a32,300) and implement extensive plans to expand and renovate Um Al-Gura girls school, Nahr Atbara, Kassala state. The school currently has 605 girls enrolled.

Sudan has one of the highest rates of out-of-school children in the entire Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region, with more than 3 million children aged from five to 13 not enrolled. More than half of those out of school are girls, mostly from rural areas where the female literacy rate is as low as 39% (pdf) and primary school completion is only 26.1%, according to Unicef. Traditional beliefs that emphasise the role of girls in the household and condone early marriage have meant that many parents take their daughters out of school as they approach puberty. Yet NGO grants, effective planning from local authorities and national enrolment campaigns are beginning to shift attitudes and boost attendance numbers. In some rural areas, girls are taking exams to enter secondary school for the first time and many who had left school are now returning.  Word of mouth is also playing a part, as girls spread stories of their newly renovated schools to their peers and encourage out-of-school children to return. \u201cI left school because it was far from my home and it wasn\u2019t so pretty. It didn\u2019t have bathrooms or games or drawings on the walls.

The tie, between two eye-wateringly expensive and lavishly paid squads, embodies the determining force of money in modern football, in which international cast lists of players go to the European clubs which pay the most. That City and PSG are now two of those mega-wealthy clubs heralds the game\u2019s increasing openness to owners from anywhere buying its famous names; neither would be at the business end of Europe\u2019s premier competition without their owners\u2019 enormous cash injections. And this quarter-final is a spectacular reminder of how football club ownership has come to reflect broader global shifts; England\u2019s only representative in the competition is owned by one of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, while PSG belongs to another tiny, rival gulf state: Qatar. The influence of these two countries under the Parc des Princes floodlights \u2013 Abu Dhabi, one of the seven mini-states in the United Arab Emirates, has fewer than a million citizens in total while the number of Qatari citizens has been put at 278,000 \u2013 underlines their vast oil and gas wealth, of course, and strategic moves into western cultural investment. This economic power is gleaming in a Europe struggling with post-industrial financial crisis, and both football clubs embody that, having been sinking financially before they were saved by the gulf.   Related: Kompany injury mars Manchester City\u2019s winning draw with Dynamo Kyiv    There is, too, a regional political dimension; the UAE and Qatar are close to enemies, supporting rival forces in the conflict-riven Middle East. Qatar financially backs Islamist groups, while the UAE determinedly opposes them and has had a crackdown internally, which has been criticised by campaign groups alleging human rights abuses. In 2014 the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors in protest at Qatar\u2019s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups. The journey from such faraway geo\u2011political wars to Eliaquim Mangala grappling with Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Parisian turf has its roots in both countries\u2019 strategy of expanding their presence and influence, and into sport and culture. Qatar\u2019s efforts extend most powerfully and controversially to winning from Fifa\u2019s 2010 executive committee the right to host the 2022 World Cup, while Abu Dhabi hosts a Formula One grand prix and is building branches of the Louvre art gallery and Guggenheim museums.     PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi celebrates the 2015 Ligue 1 title win. Photograph: Kamil Zihnioglu/AP    The actual takeovers of the clubs were different, however. City\u2019s ownership, via a private equity company, the Abu Dhabi United Group, has always stressed it was a private purchase in 2008 by Sheikh Mansour, a senior scion of the ruling Al Nahyan family, not an actual state enterprise. Senior Abu Dhabi political figures, most prominently the chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, were brought in after the first, chaotic days of crude, boastful coverage led by the takeover\u2019s front man, the Dubai property investor Sulaiman Al Fahim, who later briefly owned Portsmouth. Although City\u2019s rebuilding since, helmed by Mubarak with a vast \u00a31.2bn invested by Mansour, has been intended to reflect well on Abu Dhabi, they maintain it remains Mansour\u2019s own venture. At PSG there is no such nuance. The club is owned by the country itself, via a fund, Qatar Sports Investments, which bought it in June 2011 in a tale of the highest politics, tangled in the World Cup bid. It is a story now well told, which remains stunningly revealing about football\u2019s place in the world view of the rich and powerful. Michel Platini, Uefa president at the time, before his six-year ban from all football activities for the \u00a31.35m Sepp Blatter\u2019s Fifa paid him in 2011 for work which he completed in 2002, has been most open about the discussions.   Related: PSG and Zlatan Ibrahimovic send laboured Chelsea crashing out    In November 2010, barely a fortnight before the World Cup vote, Platini had lunch at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace with his country\u2019s president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the crown prince, now emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the Qatari prime minister. Platini has confirmed he knew that Sarkozy wanted him to vote for Qatar and Platini did change his voting intention after the meeting, from the US to Qatar, but he still maintains his president did not make a direct request: \u201cSarkozy never asked me to vote for Qatar but I knew what would be good,\u201d Platini said in September. Platini previously also told the Guardian that at the time of the lunch: \u201cI knew Sarkozy wanted the people from Qatar to buy PSG.\u201d Sarkozy is known as a supporter of PSG, which was then struggling financially under the ownership of a US investment firm, Colony Capital. After that presidential and royal lunch Platini did vote for Qatar in the Fifa process whose consequences still reverberate through the scandal-strewn corridors of its Zurich headquarters, although he has always said it was not due to Sarkozy\u2019s influence. After that France concluded lucrative trade deals with Qatar \u2013 and six months later QSI bought PSG. Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Qatari chairman of QSI and PSG, is also chairman and chief executive of the state-owned broadcasting company, beIN SPORTS, formerly Al Jazeera Sport. Three weeks after the PSG purchase it paid for French Ligue 1\u2019s TV rights, jointly with Canal+, a dramatically increased \u20ac607m a year from 2012\u201116. That deal was then renewed early, in 2014, increasing to \u20ac726m a year from 2016 to 2020. So, Qatar state money has since 2011 fuelled PSG into starry Champions League contenders and financially underpinned French football itself.   Related: Michael Garcia\u2019s report into Russia and Qatar World Cups suffers new delay    City\u2019s takeover was less high politics, at first. The club was heading into financial crisis under the ownership of the ousted Thailand prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was wanted on corruption charges at home. Mansour is said to be a football fan, like many people in the UAE which was a British protectorate until 1971, and he owned a club in Abu Dhabi, Al-Jazira. With Premier League clubs becoming serially bought by overseas investors, Mansour had his eye on doing so himself and City, although perpetually faltering, met his criteria: a big, well-supported club with a new stadium, built by the local council for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. After several days of Al Fahim talking up in the media the staggering wealth of the Abu Dhabi sheikh, Mubarak, chairman of the country\u2019s strategic government arm, the Executive Affairs Authority, was appointed chairman, to bring a more planned and dignified approach to what has indeed been huge financial investment since. The sponsorships by Etihad, the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority, which advertises the country around the world from the Manchester City pitchside hoardings, and a roster of other Abu Dhabi companies give City the look of a state enterprise \u2013 now with clubs in New York and Melbourne \u2013 but they maintain it is not. The \u00a3200m academy built across the road from the stadium, and \u00a320m college and community sports centre, have earned the owners good relations in impoverished east Manchester. They also nurtured City\u2019s fans tenderly into the unfamiliar new era of moneyed success, before the \u00a340-\u00a360 ticket prices announced for the PSG return leg, which have drawn serious and scathing protest for the first time. PSG\u2019s charge to become Europe\u2019s fourth-highest earning club, according to the accountants Deloitte, with \u20ac481m income in 2014-15, has been fuelled by the famous sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority, reported to be for \u20ac200m a year. Uefa disregarded it by half in its 2014 assessment under financial fair play rules, which require \u201cconnected\u201d sponsorship deals to be for proper market value.

This is the Mojave desert, offering few attractions to the casual visitor but the perfect environment in which to test\u00a0aircraft. It\u2019s in these barren parts that the Edwards air force base is located, where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier for the first time, and where the test pilots celebrated in Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Right Stuff proved their mettle before going on to become America\u2019s first astronauts. And it was here, at the Mojave Air and Space Port, that Virgin Galactic\u2019s VSS Enterprise took off on its fourth powered test flight on 31 October 2014. At that point, 18 months ago, Richard Branson\u2019s vision of sending members of the public into space seemed to be on the edge\u00a0of\u00a0realisation. Since the discontinuation of the space shuttle programme in 2011, Nasa has largely given up on sending people into space. And while there is plenty of interest in unmanned expeditions, like the New Horizons probe that sent dramatic pictures back from Pluto last year, what has always fired the public\u00a0imagination is the human\u00a0component. If its absence has left a void in human experience, Branson is one of several entrepreneurs who also see it as a gap in a new market. His was the first operation dedicated to civilian space travel but he\u2019s recently been joined by two others. Elon Musk, the billionaire who took PayPal to market and is behind Tesla Motors, set up Space X as a private space cargo company. It has a contract to supply the international space station, but Musk has also announced plans to send humans into space. A more direct rival is Blue Origin, a space travel company set up by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who announced last month that he aims to send people into space by 2017, although the first passengers will not be paying\u00a0customers.     The new SpaceShipTwo craft, VSS Unity, is essentially the same as Voyager, which crashed 18 months ago. Modifications include a safety lock to prevent the premature initiation of the feathering system that downed Voyager. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    Only just over 500 people have ever travelled into space \u2013 that rather arbitrary line that\u2019s defined as 100km above Earth\u2019s surface. Branson\u2019s plan was to rapidly expand that number, but by October 2014 this had already taken much longer than he had anticipated. Ten years earlier Branson had set up Virgin Galactic and gone into business with Scaled Composite, a company created by Burt Rutan, the renowned aerospace engineer who built SpaceShipOne, the first privately constructed and owned spacecraft to reach space. SpaceShipOne had been funded by Microsoft\u2019s Paul Allen as a scientific challenge rather than a commercial enterprise. But Branson wanted to build the world\u2019s first spaceline for civilians, and with Rutan on board he announced that the first public space flights would begin in 2007. And the first passenger would be one Richard Branson. That turned out to be a wildly ambitious prediction. But then Branson\u2019s brand image \u2013 with his attention-grabbing air balloon and powerboat escapades \u2013 is based on wild ambition. And on that bright October day in California, it must have seemed as if Branson\u2019s commercial blast-off was finally in sight. That was until the Enterprise broke up in mid-air, killing the co-pilot Michael Alsbury, but miraculously leaving the pilot-in-command, Peter Siebold, to fall 10 miles and survive.   Related: Virgin Galactic pilot tells of falling from the sky after SpaceShip Two broke up    It was an incredible descent in which the injured, oxygen-starved and freezing Siebold slipped in and out of consciousness while managing to free himself from his pilot\u2019s seat, thus enabling his parachute to open automatically at around 20,000ft and deliver him, broken-boned but alive, to the ground.   Related: Virgin Galactic crash: co-pilot unlocked braking system too early, inquiry finds    At that moment the future of Virgin Galactic seemed to lie with the Enterprise in ruins in the desert. As Branson rushed to the crash site he was filled with doubts about the project\u2019s survival. \u201cFor 12 hours after the accident we were very much trying to decide whether it was worth the risk of continuing,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019m not the sort of person who gives up on things. The first time we crossed the Atlantic in the balloon it crashed, and we went on and did the Pacific. First time we crossed the Atlantic in a boat it sank, and we went on and got the record. So, generally speaking, we will pick ourselves up, brush ourselves down and carry on. But in the first 12 hours we did not know if any of the accident was our fault or whether it was a technical issue that couldn\u2019t be\u00a0rectified.\u201d Then it became clear that the crash was the consequence of a catastrophic pilot error. Alsbury had prematurely released a lever that controlled the aircraft\u2019s moveable tail section, triggering a chain of events that resulted in the craft\u2019s mid-air break-up. Mistakes happen in test flights, and the death of test pilots has not been uncommon in the history of space flight. But the history of space flight has been governmental or military and therefore subject to different expectations. Nasa reported a 3% fatality rate when it was busy sending people up to space. As Branson said just eight months before the accident: \u201cFor a government-owned company, you can just about get away with losing 3% of your clients. For a private company you can\u2019t really lose anybody.\u201d He was talking about paying clients, but, still, any loss of life was bad publicity and potentially a commercial death knell \u2013 especially considering the cost of a ticket to space. The first 100 \u201cfuture astronauts\u201d who signed up for Virgin Galactic\u2019s journey to 100km above the Earth had paid $200,000 for the privilege. A further 600, who would follow the first 100 into space, put down a sizeable deposit on a $250,000 ticket. All 700 would experience zero-gravity for six minutes and look down on the planet curving away beneath them. But no one wants to lay out that kind of money to die.     Virgin Galactic\u2019s chief test pilot, Dave Mackay. \u2018At first there is silence,\u2019 he says, \u2018and then the engines fire up and you blast off, and it really gets going.\u2019 Forget seeing the Earth from space: \u2018The journey up there will be the thing,\u2019 says Mackay. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    Virgin Galactic put out a statement in which it appeared to distance itself from the accident, noting that it was its partner Scaled Composite that was responsible for the flight, and the two pilots were Scaled employees. Previous communiques about successful flights had not made such distinctions. In the event very few future astronauts pulled out. Nevertheless Virgin, whose new manufacturing arm the Spaceship Company was already building a second spacecraft, suspended ticket sales. A subsequent investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board found that there was a failure by Scaled Composite \u201cto consider and protect against human error\u201d. Sixteen months on from the crash, Scaled Composite had been removed from the picture, and the world\u2019s media were invited back to Mojave to see the unveiling of the new spacecraft\u2026 Mojave Air and Space Port is not just a site for aeronautical births, it\u2019s also a giant graveyard for old and disused aircraft that sit around, sometimes for years on end, slowly being corroded or cannibalised. It\u2019s an eerie setting in many ways, a limitless vista of futuristic visions and broken dreams, of soaring ambition and once-modern flying machines brought sadly back down to earth. Around the airport are dotted a number of giant hangars. In one of these, hundreds of Virgin Galactic and the Space Company personnel and media representatives and future astronauts are gathered to witness the first public viewing of the new aircraft. Among them is Dave Mackay, a bald, short, quietly spoken man in his late 50s. You\u2019d walk past him in the street without taking a second look, but he is Virgin Galactic\u2019s chief test pilot and therefore possesses the kind of nerveless courage that is the preserve of a tiny fraction of humanity. Mackay\u2019s lifelong aspiration has been to be an astronaut. That\u2019s why he became an RAF pilot. He always hoped Britain would develop a space programme but by the time he quit the RAF in 1995 and joined Virgin Atlantic to fly Boeing 747s, he had given up on that dream. Then along came Virgin Galactic, and space beckoned once\u00a0more. He had piloted the test flight immediately before the one that crashed in 2014. Did Alsbury\u2019s death make him think again? \u201cMichael\u2019s death was devastating for everyone here,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was a lovely man. But no, it didn\u2019t make me reconsider. I\u2019m used to it. Three of my colleagues in the RAF died. When I first heard about the death rate among fighter pilots I couldn\u2019t believe it. But you adjust to it. And that\u2019s the same with being a test pilot. We paid our respects to Michael but then continued with the job.\u201d He tells me about the \u201cexhilaration\u201d of flying in SpaceShipTwo. Adapted from Burt Rutan\u2019s design for SpaceShipOne, the spacecraft \u2013 or \u201cvehicle\u201d as everyone calls it in Mojave \u2013 is carried into the air by a mothership, the twin-fuselage WhiteKnightTwo. SpaceShipTwo is designed with Rutan\u2019s revolutionary \u201cfeathering mechanism\u201d, a shape-changing airfoil that creates a shuttlecock effect on re-entry, and helps the aircraft \u2013 unlike those used by Space X and Blue Origin \u2013 to land on a runway. On take-off, the mothership releases the spacecraft at 50,000 feet. \u201cAt first there is silence,\u201d says Mackay, \u201cand then the engines fire up and you blast off, and it really gets going.\u201d     Branson, pictured with his son Sam, daughter-in-law Isabella and grandchild Eva-Deia, has long said he will be on Virgin Galactic\u2019s maiden voyage, along with members of his family. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    He compares it to putting your foot down in a performance car if the acceleration could go on for over a minute. Only \u201cit\u2019s so much greater than that\u201d. He tells Virgin marketing people that they\u2019ve got it wrong: they sell it on zero gravity and the experience of looking back down at the curvature of the Earth. \u201cBut,\u201d he says without a trace of hyperbole, \u201cI believe the journey up there will be the thing.\u201d Inside the hangar we hear speeches from Virgin Galactic bigwigs, trumpeting what a fabulous achievement the new aircraft is. But it\u2019s essentially the same as the one that crashed, with a few minor alterations, including a safety lock to prevent the premature initiation of the feathering system that led to the crash. This event in the desert is not the launch of a new aircraft \u2013 more testing is required before it leaves the ground. It\u2019s not even a product launch, because the new product is largely the same as the old one. But it could be seen as a relaunch of Virgin Galactic \u2013 a chance to announce to the world that everything is fine and back on track. For that reason, perhaps, there is a sense of corporate nervousness in the air. A figure of $500m has been mentioned as the amount so far invested in the venture. That\u2019s a lot to lose if things go pear shaped. Understandably, no one wants to spend too much time reflecting on the accident. Alsbury\u2019s name is mentioned but it\u2019s a swift reference to the past before moving quickly on to the glorious future. The note that everyone strives for is epic, historic and optimistic. \u201cTogether we open space to change the world for good,\u201d is the Virgin Galactic mission statement, repeated several times. There are recorded messages from Stephen Hawking, who hopes to be among the first passengers, and the young human rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai. Sarah Brightman, one of the future astronauts, sings Happy Birthday to Branson\u2019s one-year-old granddaughter. There\u2019s a valedictory sentimentality to proceedings, as if humanity itself was preparing to vacate the Earth. Amid the songs, speeches and testaments comes the curtain-raising moment as Branson rides out in a Land Rover \u2013 sponsor of the project \u2013 towing the new SpaceShipTwo named VSS Unity. He\u2019s dressed in a black leather biker\u2019s jacket, blue jeans and a crisp white shirt, his flowing snowy locks swept back to his collar and his goatee beard and moustache broken by a trademark beaming smile. He looks like a retired Hell\u2019s Angel from the stockbroker belt, but it works. This is the man the media has come to see: Branson the eternal billionaire rebel; the consummate self-promoting businessman; the man who has jazzed up planes, trains and now, he hopes, spacecraft. In a hail of flashbulbs, Virgin Galactic is back in business.     Would Branson be disappointed if in two years\u2019 time the first flight had still not been made? \u2018I would be astounded,\u2019 he replies. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    But what makes people want to travel to space? Branson likes to compare it to the early days of jet travel. That was prohibitively expensive for the vast majority, but just as jet travel has come to the point where many millions now fly, so one day, he says, will space travel. But those early jet passengers had destinations. Six minutes in suborbital space can\u2019t really be described as a destination. So what\u2019s the attraction? Branson believes the question requires no answer for half the people in the world because they instinctively understand the desire to go to space. For the benefit of the other half, he suggests it\u2019s a means of getting to know ourselves better, and in particular to respect our miraculous place in the universe. He tells me: \u201cWe have one planet in our solar system that\u2019s habitable and that\u2019s the Earth, and space travel can transform things back here for the better. First of all by just having people go to space and look back on this fragile planet we live on. People have come back transformed and have done fantastic things. There\u2019s a wonderful book called The Overview Effect, which has interviews with all the people who\u2019ve been to space and [tells of] their experiences, and how it\u2019s changed them. I look forward to being changed in a positive way.\u201d Put this way, and leaving aside the commercial potential, the journey becomes less spatial than spiritual. There is room on board for six passengers. Branson has long said he will be on the first flight along with family members, several of whom, including his 92-year-old mother, were present in Mojave. But which family members? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see nearer the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole family want to go: nephews, nieces, everyone except my wife. Both my children have now got their hands full with babies, so it\u2019s possible that on the initial flight I\u2019ll go up on my own and they\u2019ll go up on subsequent flights. We\u2019ll make that decision in six or nine months\u2019 time.\u201d For the original 100 who paid out $200,000, there is a lottery system to decide who goes when. Several celebrities are rumoured to be among the group, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, but none were present at Mojave. However, many non-celebrity future astronauts were there, among them Ed Holliday, a youthful-looking 72-year-old from West Virginia \u2013 \u201cjust like Chuck Yeager\u201d. Like Branson, he found the question of why he wanted to go to space barely worth raising. \u201cI always say that\u2019s the backwards question. Why would you not want to do this? What possible reason would you not want to go to space?\u201d What about the crash? \u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant. That\u2019s why they call them test pilots,\u201d he guffaws. \u201cThey were testing the vehicle.\u201d Holliday is a pilot himself of 40 years, though he made his money in the \u201cinvestment business\u201d. Along with the other founders, he\u2019s been through simulator training in Philadelphia in a giant centrifuge with a rotating bucket at the end that creates six G-force. \u201cThat\u2019s why they don\u2019t have 100 founders now. Some didn\u2019t like that. Some got airsick or burst into tears.\u201d He lets out another big laugh.    It will be the best funfair ride the planet has to offer, but a funfair ride all the same    There are now said to be 89 founders left. Namira Salim, a Pakistani woman who lives in Monaco, with a family construction business in Dubai, is one of them. She says that space travel was her childhood dream. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking a risk,\u201d she tells me, \u201creaching for your dreams and doing the impossible to inspire others, and above all I think space flight is about making space for others. You know one could buy an expensive ticket and go to the international space station, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re going to open space travel for the common man. But by being part of such a programme as this you\u2019re ensuring that\u00a0the price will come down due to our initial investment, and any common person who wants to go to space can one day go to space, and moreover it makes a peaceful contribution to Earth and to the different technologies we can use to make life better for humanity. So that\u2019s the motivation.\u201d In this telling, space travel becomes a kind of altruistic act of generosity towards the \u201ccommon person\u201d and a step towards world peace. That\u2019s quite a billing to live up to, especially at this stage. Of course it\u2019s necessary for Virgin to make its future astronauts, especially the founders, feel special, as though they are travel pioneers and social innovators. But the reality is that they will fly 100km up from the Earth\u2019s surface, hang around for a few minutes and come back down to the same place. In other words, it will be the best funfair ride the planet has to offer, but a funfair ride all the same. Branson talks of point-to-point travel as a long-term aim, going into space as a means of getting from one part of the Earth to another at tremendous speed. He is also looking at setting up a habitat in space and then doing orbital flights. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re working on for the future,\u201d he tells me. He says the Spaceship Company is also exploring whether it could work to reroute a giant asteroid, should one come heading towards Earth. \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of thing we\u2019d need to get government money as well as private money to make happen.\u201d In the meantime, another division of Virgin is making large numbers of small satellites. \u201cThere are 4 billion people who don\u2019t have internet or Wi-Fi access,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the best way to get to them. Nothing will pull people out of poverty more than being connected.\u201d           Sir Richard Branson: self-proclaimed experts wrong about Virgin Galactic explosion - video    But he comes back once more to what he says are the \u201cmillions and millions of people out there who would love to become astronauts. If we can make it environmentally friendly, if we can make it affordable and if we can make it safe, then in time your children and my grandchildren will all have the chance to go to space.\u201d To critics who argue that firing rockets to take sightseers up into the darkness is environmentally unsound and unnecessary, Branson says that the passengers on his first space flights will account for an amount of carbon \u201cnot dissimilar to an upper-class seat flying from London to New York and back\u201d, and that over the next few years they believe they can make the flights \u201cas near as dammit carbon neutral\u201d. Having made several predictions over the years about the timing of the initial flight, Branson is under strict instructions by his employees not to give any further dates. When I ask if he aims to beat Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin outfit into space, he says: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be in a race with him for obvious reasons.\u201d Would you be disappointed, I ask, if in two years\u2019 time the first flight had still not been made? \u201cI would be astounded,\u201d he replies. Perhaps a better clue to the expected date is that when I ask him if his mother would be on board in the first flights, he says \u201cShe\u2019ll be close to 93 then. Whether her body could cope with the G-force I\u2019m not sure.\u201d That would mean he\u2019s looking at the first flight some time next year. If you\u2019re interested, it\u2019s probably wise to apply soon. Virgin Galactic is about to start selling tickets again. To add to the current 700 ticket holders, Branson thinks there are a few thousand people who can afford the current prices. And they\u2019re going up, not down. It will now cost $300,000 to become an astronaut. \u201cThen,\u201d says Branson, \u201cwe\u2019ll slowly but steadily start bringing the price down as we build more spaceships and more spaceports around the world. I would love it if in 20 years\u2019 time people who\u2019d done relatively well can afford to go.\u201d If you can\u2019t wait, then it\u2019s time to mortgage the house.

Oh no, of course not. What the city is actually getting, as he prepares to leave for possibly higher office, is a Dubai-on-Westbourne, -on-Lee, -on-Effra, -on-Bollo Brook, -on-Quaggy, and indeed on most of the obscure tributaries and secondary rivers of the capital, as well as on the Thames, and many of the spaces between them. For, as is possibly now dawning on a wider public, it is hopelessly naive to believe that Johnson believes something when he says it. You didn\u2019t think he really meant it, did you? Ha ha ha. What a card he is. It\u2019s not just about tall buildings, although the number of towers higher than 20 storeys proposed for London now stands at more than 400. It\u2019s also about bloated, bulging, light-blocking buildings of medium height, and about the limited attempts to insist on design quality, or to get new developments to create neighbourhoods that are more than a sum of their parts, or have any meaningful relationships with the areas into which they are inserted.    The Whitechapel Sainsbury\u2019s plan has the makings of a half-decent piece of urbanism if it were 15% or 20% less greedy    In the dying days of the Johnsonian empire, several proposals indicate the sort of city he is leaving behind. Some are hoping for a final signoff before he goes, in the manner of outgoing American presidents pardoning their disreputable mates, or to benefit from the inattention of the election and interregnum. Some will be in the in-tray of his dazed successor. They include a hefty tower in Chiswick, west London, almost certainly a harbinger of other as-yet-undisclosed lumpy towers around it, which as objectors say will wreck the setting of the nearby Gunnersbury Park. As is usual in such proposals there is no indication of the collective effect of this and the other future towers that would follow, no vision of the radically altered district they would create, or suggestion of how such things as schools and transport would handle the new numbers. There is the recently approved redevelopment of New Scotland Yard, close to Westminster Abbey, with strident blocks rising to 20 storeys that significantly increase the scale of development close to the venerable monument. On the Isle of Dogs is a planned tower, which along with others contributes to a bizarre, half-accidental urban experiment whereby the district called South Quay might end up with the highest residential densities in the world.     \u2018A phalanx of towers that will cast land to its north in almost permanent shadow\u2019: the planned development in Bishopsgate Goodsyard, east London.    In Whitechapel, east London, on a site owned by J Sainsbury plc, a close-packed set of blocks culminate in a 100-metre tower that has attracted more than 5,000 signatures in opposition. They object to its effect on a nearby conservation area and Grade-I listed almshouses of the style and time of Christopher Wren. On 18 April a public hearing starts to help the mayor decide on Bishopsgate Goodsyard, also east London, where a phalanx of towers is proposed that would cast a swath of land to its north into almost permanent shadow. In some there are signs of what might be called good architecture struggling to get out, but it\u2019s not enough to overcome weak planning. The Chiswick Curve and Alpha Square both have a sort of curvaceous stylishness thanks to their architects, Egret West and Pilbrow and Partners. Whitechapel Square, as the Sainsbury\u2019s project is called, is in the sober, gridded style of current critically approved architecture. The perspectives show pleasant-looking open spaces, miraculously sunlit in what are canyons between the blocks, presumably made possible by the sort of occasional solar alignment that causes Stonehenge to light up at the summer solstice. The plans show that these spaces follow something like a traditional street pattern. But then you realise that they are actually raised on a podium two storeys high, so as to slide a supermarket underneath, which reduces their resemblance to actual streets.    Density is necessarily in itself bad, but it requires a degree of skill in planning and design that is not on offer    In all cases the arguments for development are similar: that London is growing, that it needs more homes, that change is in the city\u2019s nature, that the unacceptable alternative would be to build on the green belt, that the city should be open for business and investment. All sound reasonable. The issue is whether the proposals in question are the best ways to achieve them. For, as is by now well known, the majority of apartments created by such schemes are priced too high to be much use in addressing London\u2019s most pressing needs, but are at best clumsy mechanisms whereby a diminishing tithe of \u201caffordable\u201d housing can be extracted from developers. The definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d to which London is \u201copen\u201d tends overwhelmingly to be the quick bucks to be made from property speculation, rather than places offering long-term employment, which tend to be squeezed out by the rush for residential development. As for the green belt, it is now a pressing question how much the public spaces of London, and parks like Gunnersbury, should be compromised in the name of sometimes indifferent and inaccessible fields in Surrey. It is also reasonable to ask whether London\u2019s low-density outer suburbs could not soak up more of the pressure currently being felt by the inner boroughs.     \u2018Fiddling with vanity projects while the city burns with clumsy overdevelopment\u2019: Boris Johnson at the Shard, London, 2014. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    It also has to be asked how far the logic of stacking up units can be pushed. Why not maximise everything everywhere? Why worry about daylight or open space at all? Why bother with keeping historic buildings, old churches, and anything else that gets in the way of optimising the figures? At some point even the most dedicated numbers fanatic would accept that quality has to be asserted against quantity. The Whitechapel Sainsbury\u2019s plan, for example, has the makings of a half-decent piece of urbanism if it were maybe 15% or 20% less greedy. As it stands it should be dispatched by planners back to its developers and architects as a crude imposition on a rich and historic part of London. Even so, the main point is not that density is necessarily in itself bad, but that it requires a degree of skill in planning and design that is not on offer. If South Quay is to be a place of unequalled urban intensity, rather than an accidental heap of investment units, perhaps those who would have it so could show us what this wondrous place will be like? Richard Rogers argued long ago that cities such as Barcelona and Paris, and indeed some historic parts of British cities, show that high densities help cities thrive if well planned and designed. His theory was built into both national and London policies, but while the part that was about increasing numbers is ever more enthusiastically adopted, the parts about planning and design have been progressively watered down.     The new view in Elder Street, Shoreditch, if the Bishopsgate Goodsyard development is approved.    This is not all the London mayor\u2019s responsibility. As Tony Travers of the LSE likes to point out, the enthusiasm for ever greater housing numbers is partly the result of government policy that pushes local authorities into raising more and more of their revenue from granting planning permission for housing, while reducing it from other sources. Both South Quay and current proposals for Whitechapel, which as well as the Sainsbury\u2019s site include other clutches of towers, reflect the enthusiasm of the former mayor of the borough of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, for pushing development numbers as hard as he could. He commissioned a masterplan, \u201cWhitechapel vision\u201d from the architects BDP, which, rather than set out standards that developers might be expected to meet, seemed to beg them to do their trashiest work. It proposed random and clashing skyscrapers squeezed wherever they might go, plus nugatory and ill-considered attempts to improve the \u201cpublic realm\u201d between them. But the London mayor has the power to overrule boroughs\u2019 decisions to approve or refuse planning permission. He and his office are also directly involved in what are called opportunity areas, and write planning policy. These powers can be used to set standards, to lead by example, to show what a stupendously beautiful place, as Johnson might put it, the new \u201cdensified\u201d London could be. Instead he has approved all of the projects he has chosen to determine, often overruling boroughs\u2019 opposition. In opportunity areas such as Vauxhall and Nine Elms, attempts to insist on quality in planning and design have been sketchy and flimsy. The widely praised redevelopment of King\u2019s Cross gives some clues how it might be done, but they are not followed. There are hints that Bishopsgate Goodsyard might be one project where the mayor asserts that developers are going too far, in which case there should be some joy that a sinner repenteth. But such a decision would not fundamentally alter the fact that current patterns of growth in London are signs of weakness in government, not strength, bulging up opportunistically wherever it can, rather than in the places where it would best serve the city. At the same time, of course, Johnson has backed a series of gestures that don\u2019t deliver what they promised: the Olympic Park\u2019s Orbit tower, which now requires the addition of a \u00a33.5m slide to boost its flagging popularity, the barely used cable car called the Emirates Airline, the Garden Bridge. Goodbye Boris. You have not left your city, as the Ephebic oath required of Athenians, more beautiful than you found it. You have been more like Nero, fiddling with vanity projects while it burns with clumsy overdevelopment. Ultimately this is bad for business and bad for the London brand, promoting as it does both a speculative bubble and shoddy products. To this extent those much-courted overseas investors, as they will come to realise, are being conned. It is, to switch from ancient Rome, like making over a house with gym, Jacuzzi and conservatory, while leaving the plumbing rickety and dry rot untouched.

Objectors commissioned an alternative scheme, which showed how more homes could be fitted on to the site with a less insensitive design. None of this was good enough for Johnson, who used his powers to approve the developers\u2019 plans. The developers took the opportunity to reduce their provision of affordable housing still further. Convoys WharfA billion-pound project for 3,500 homes with three new towers in Deptford, south-east London. The developers Hutchison Whampoa complained that the local council was holding things up by making too many demands. The council, Lewisham, said that the problems were caused by the developers\u2019 failure to cooperate. Johnson chose to believe Hutchison Whampoa, and approved their proposals in 2014, in the name of speeding up development. Two years later, not much is happening there.

Related: Manchester City on track for top four as Samir Nasri sees off West Brom    Before the thigh injury that had ruled out Nasri since the 5-1 win against Bournemouth on 17 October, the Frenchman had faded from the first-team picture. He was again a replacement that day and the sense was of a footballer whose shining talent should make him an A-lister but who would depart City having disappointed. The caveat here is that Nasri has the technical and creative abilities that Guardiola loves to harness. Witnessing the way the 28-year-old operated as an all-action de facto No10 against West Bromwich Albion, popping up in defence and on hand to hit City\u2019s 66th-minute winner suggests Guardiola may consider giving Nasri a chance. But, when it was put to him, the Frenchman said: \u201cI don\u2019t know because you never know. Maybe he comes with his [own] ideas and stuff. I played against him in the past, he had some praise for me but I think that was like five years ago now [when at Arsenal]. That is one thing. \u201cWhen the pre-season is going to start I am going to be fresh so I hope that will help me and I will try to perform because when you have been out for so long you are more hungry when you come back. You don\u2019t want to waste your time. You want to be back with a bang. If I stay working with Pep Guardiola, if he wants me, he\u2019s just going to be a lucky man because I will be really hungry. \u201cI am the type of player for his philosophy and the way he likes his team to play so we are just going to see and on the first day of pre-season I will have a chat with him because I am going to be really hungry.\u201d This desire was City\u2019s gain in a match they had to win, as Nasri ghosted into the area to beat Ben Foster to complete a victory that ensures no slip in the chase for a Champions League berth.           In the battle of extreme \u2013 and some might say obscene \u2013 wealth, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are set to square off again for a place in the Champions League semi-finals. Whose money will prove more mighty?    Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side started by conceding a soft St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon goal. Only six minutes were complete when the paper-thin home defence allowed the forward to collect the ball in space inside the area. Joe Hart compounded the complacency by freezing as the ball sailed passed him on his near post. From this juncture City chugged along unconvincingly even after Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 19th-minute penalty. What helped Nasri change the contest was the arrival of Kevin De Bruyne and Yaya Tour\u00e9 on the hour. Instantly City were a vintage one-touch side whose devilry West Brom could not contain. Nasri\u2019s finish followed a deft De Bruyne pass that split Tony Pulis\u2019s side open and by the end City fully deserved the victory. As does Nasri deserve credit for the display, one that is particularly satisfying after a lonely six months. When the season ends he plans no holiday. \u201cI had a break for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me I travelled, did everything because I needed to clear my mind for sure, when you have all of this.

In no particular order, the new Masters champion claimed it was \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201csurreal\u201d, \u201cmind-boggling\u201d and \u201csomething I can\u2019t put into words\u201d to don the Green Jacket.   Related: Masters 2016: Danny Willett wins after Jordan Spieth\u2019s disaster at the 12th    If golf followed popular opinion, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Luke Donald, Justin Rose or Paul Casey would have prevailed for the English at Augusta long before Willett. There will also be inevitable claims that Jordan Spieth handed the 80th edition of the Masters on a plate to the 28-year-old Yorkshireman. The initial point has been illustrated as flawed, the latter desperately unfair. When Spieth collapsed at Amen Corner on Sunday, Willett had to be in position to profit. \u201cIf I had been five over par then it wouldn\u2019t have mattered what Jordan did,\u201d Willett acknowledged. When suddenly holding the lead, with the eyes of the golfing world upon him, Willett had to ensure he didn\u2019t become the next player to fold. Three holes could have represented a nerve-jangling eternity. The ease with which the champion burst through the finishing tape should be fully appreciated, especially by those who have fallen short in similar circumstances. \u201cYou practice,\u201d said Willett when asked for an explanation for his composure. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do; endless hours of chipping, putting, hitting shots, imagining hitting shots at certain golf courses at certain times. \u201cFortunately enough, I have been able to relive some of those dreams and some of those practice sessions.\u201d At 28, Willett has been something of a slow burner. Albeit two years the Northern Irishman\u2019s senior, he played as a team-mate of Rory McIlroy in the 2007 Walker Cup. Willett turned professional the following year, where progress was steady rather than stunning; ongoing back problems, which still have to be carefully managed, threatened to halt his progression. Two years ago Willett was bouncing about from 103rd to 102nd, 85th and 83rd in the world rankings. Today, he is No9. When Chubby Chandler recruited Willett to his International Sports Management stable, he clearly believed he was looking after the affairs of an able professional. Chandler soon told those around him that even he had been surprised just how fine a player Willett, once the top-ranked amateur in the world, was. He had a wide range of shots to call upon, which set him apart from even many of those making a healthy living from golf. There has never been a question over Willett\u2019s belief, verging on cockiness at times, which has now been justified in wonderful style.           Danny Willett on winning the Masters: \u2018It\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s surreal\u2019    Willett always knew, and this is crucial, how to win; right from the moment he was the English amateur champion. He recorded European Tour victories in 2012, 2014 and 2015 before lifting the Dubai Desert Classic trophy in February. The coaching methods of the highly-rated Mike Walker, under the watchful eye of Pete Cowen, have paid handsome dividends. \u201cWith Pete and Mike, you work on uncomfortable things,\u201d Willett explained. \u201cEvery time you go to the range, you aren\u2019t turning up to get a pat on the back, to be told how well you are doing. You go there to try and get better, to try and get that 1% better. I think by doing that, actually trying to accomplish perfection, it makes you uncomfortable. \u201cTo actually delve into how you swing it, certain aspects of your game that you might not like but to try and improve; that makes you uncomfortable. As a person, nobody likes being told that they don\u2019t do something well enough. \u201cSo I think then realising that you have got to work on certain aspects of your game, coming to the uncomfortable realisation that you\u2019re going to have to work very hard at it, kind of helps you through these times. I felt like I had done enough work, that I had hit enough balls under their supervision that each shot I was faced with, I just went through the same process. I tried to remind myself of the shots I hit back on the range.\u201d Owing to personal circumstances, namely the arrival of his baby son, Willett may have started a trend. He was the last player to register at the Masters; just as Jack Nicklaus was, 30 years earlier, before going on to record a famous win. Nicklaus even took time to offer congratulations. \u201cI\u2019ve watched Danny Willett play on television a few times and when I\u2019ve seen him swing the golf club, I have thought: \u2018Well, this young man looks like he\u2019s a pretty darn good player,\u2019\u201d said the 18-time major winner. \u201cHe had moved himself up to 12th in the world, so he\u2019s obviously done something right and was playing very good golf coming into Augusta.

The decommissioned QE2, the Cunard ocean liner built in Clydebank in the early 1960s and now in a Dubai dry dock, should return to Glasgow and become a new home for the art school.

I didn\u2019t understand this work when I saw it in the last Venice Biennale and I don\u2019t understand it now. Understanding is often overrated. With Rottenberg and her flower-sniffing giantess-protagonist, at large in a world of mad machinery and sliding doors, it is best just go with it. Rottenberg\u2019s world is one of futile work, mystery and misery, as inexplicable as our own \u2013 but funnier. Migrations of objects and ideas are at the heart of Amie Siegel\u2019s 2013 film installation Provenance, also at Tramway. One of the best works in the festival, Siegel\u2019s film follows the changing fortunes of the furniture that French architect Le Corbusier and his colleague Pierre Jeanneret created for the modernist architecture they designed in the Indian city of Chandigarh. Much of this furniture has now made its way to Europe and the US, ending up in swanky apartments and staterooms on private yachts.      Mika Rottenberg\u2019s NoNoseKnows at Tramway.

In a nice circularity, Siegel\u2019s sumptuous film also ends up in a London auction, where we watch it going under the hammer and becoming yet another marketable commodity fetish.

In the rundown 1960s Savoy shopping mall, a number of artists associated with London\u2019s Open School East and the Peckham art scene have taken over several units. Outrageous clothing from the Acid Prawn fashion label (transparent polythene trousers, anyone?), sculptural wreckage made from beans and pulses and tobacco, scraps of fabric and upholstery stuffing compete seamlessly with the stuff of retail and the palmist\u2019s and podiatrist\u2019s cabins. The mall is already funky in a way many of the more self-conscious art interventions in the festival fail to be.     Tamara Henderson\u2019s show.

Bright woven sacks filled with coal dust, shiny metal drooled with pungent coal tar, sheets of cut, carved and flopping pink rubber, steel cages and obscure machine-parts all have their place in this rambling sculpture. Barclay\u2019s work harks back both to Robert Morris and 60s formalist sculpture as it negotiates material differences, the detail and the larger gesture, the feminine and the masculine. But what do these terms mean nowadays? Much of the sculpture in the festival plays on such tropes. In comparison, Cosima von Bonin\u2019s huge installation on the ground floor at the Gallery of Modern Art feels like it is going through the motions. The Cologne artist\u2019s giant soft-toy seafood, skateboarding clams and sofa-surfing crustacea are a mannered and inconsequential cast of characters. None of this undersea life knows quite what to do with itself.  With its photographic darkroom-cum-yurt, its giant floppy figures, its clunky car, road-trip movies, kimonos, plants and groovy soundtrack, Tamara Henderson\u2019s installation in the Mitchell Library avoids the craft trap by sheer wilfulness and exuberance \u2013 although, as with Von Bonin, filling a big space with lots of stuff doesn\u2019t necessarily make for real complexity, only impenetrability. Like a lot of art now, Henderson\u2019s work feels provisional, a way of getting things to talk to one another, and turning the audience into actors in the drama, scrabbling to find the plot.

You could argue that chasing someone down is an easier way to win a tournament but he looks comfortable when holding leads as well; he has won in all sorts of different ways. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t put you on edge, you don\u2019t watch Danny play and ever think that something is about to go wrong.\u201d Walker\u2019s testimony is important because it was the highly respected tutor, plus his boss Pete Cowen, whom Willett credited with helping him become a major winner. Oh, and Willett is now the joint favourite to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. \u201cYou practise,\u201d explained Willett. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do; endless hours of chipping, putting, hitting shots, imagining hitting shots at certain golf courses at certain times. Fortunately enough I have been able to relive some of those dreams and some of those practice sessions. \u201cWith Pete and Mike, you work on uncomfortable things. Every time you go to the range you aren\u2019t turning up to get a pat on the back, to be told how well you are doing. You go there to try and get better, to try and get that 1% better. By doing that, actually trying to accomplish perfection, makes you uncomfortable. To delve into how you swing it, certain aspects of your game that you might not like but to try and improve, that makes you uncomfortable. Nobody likes being told that they don\u2019t do something well enough. \u201cSo realising that you have got to work on certain aspects of your game, coming to the uncomfortable realisation that you\u2019re going to have to work very hard at it, helps you through at these times. I felt like I had done enough work, that I had hit enough balls under their supervision. Each shot I was faced with, I just went through the same process. I tried to remind myself of the shots I hit back on the range.\u201d As is typical, Walker had departed Augusta on Friday evening. He is back on the road this week, to the Spanish Open, having \u201cpinched myself\u201d after Willett\u2019s win. \u201cI am like any other golfer, I dream of Augusta National,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhen you are watching someone win, with a vested interest, you can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d Neither could Sir Alex Ferguson, who told Willett in the midst of celebrations that he had lost an \u00a38,000 bet on Spieth to be Masters champion. \u201cI\u2019m so delighted, honestly. Happy to throw it away,\u201d said the former Manchester United manager. \u201cYou need to know where to put your money,\u201d replied the laughing champion. Willett also revealed some advice from Ferguson, given during his party on Sunday night, which he intends to follow. \u201cHe said, \u2018When I was at Manchester United, we never looked back on what we had achieved. We always looked forward. As soon as we win a trophy, it is forgotten about. The next morning we wake up and try to work hard to win the next trophy.\u2019 For him to say that puts things back in perspective from a true winner\u2019s point of view. It gave me an insight into what a true champion would think and that\u2019s how I\u2019m sure Rory [McIlroy], Jordan and Jason [Day] think. They don\u2019t rest on their laurels. They are back in the gym working hard or on the range practising, trying to make sure that when they next come out they will be competing.\u201d When Walker inherited Willett almost three years ago the player\u2019s morale was low and he was labouring with a damaging \u201cdouble miss\u201d, shots spraying wildly left and right. Back problems were also a recurring feature \u2013 even in 2014 he was outside the top 100 in the world. Today Willett is No9. Chubby Chandler confided upon recruiting Willett to his International Sports Management stable that the player was better than he had realised, with a natural talent for shaping a multitude of shots. The conundrum lay in realisation of potential. The explanation for his upward curve \u2013 fitness and the putting progress as influenced by Dr Paul Hurrion aside \u2013 is a simple one. \u201cHe is a very hard worker,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHe has taken complete ownership of his golf swing and he understands it more than most. He is quite technical and I think that keeps him calm.\u201d Willett had never lacked talent or, crucially, the capacity to win. Confidence has not been in short supply, edging towards cockiness upon first glance. He was a Walker Cup player in 2007, alongside McIlroy, and a one-time English amateur champion. Success at the 2016 Dubai Desert Classic in February endorsed Willett\u2019s decision to retain full-time status on the European Tour this year but a transatlantic switch now inevitably beckons. \u201cHe was the world No1 as an amateur and I think players get used to that title,\u201d Walker added. \u201cI don\u2019t know this, I am only presuming, but I would imagine he has his sights on the same thing as a professional. He will want to go on and win as many trophies as he can.\u201d Walker says the star pupil\u2019s success was even more unlikely given the birth of his son at the end of last month. Willett was actually the 89th and last player to register at the Masters. \u201cHe was only there a day later than would normally be the case,\u201d the coach said. \u201cSo he wasn\u2019t nearly as under-prepared as people have been making out. He has actually only been playing one-week-on, one-week-off recently anyway. He knows what he is doing. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he would struggle because of the build-up. Quite the opposite. He is very strong in the wind, he was very impressive in warm-ups. He is a good iron player, which Augusta suits, a good chipper and his putting has improved. I\u2019m not saying for a second I knew beforehand that he would win, but I thought he had half a chance. He has played in WGC events recently and done well.\u201d Jack Nicklaus, not only an 18-times major champion but also a 19-times runner-up, offered high praise. \u201cWhat impressed me so much is that when he realised he was in a position to win he finished it, and that\u2019s the mark of a champion. To finish a good round, give yourself an opportunity to win \u2026 when the other fellow doesn\u2019t finish you\u2019ve got to be there,\u201d Nicklaus added. \u201cDanny Willett was and kudos to him.\u201d The 80th Masters will inevitably be remembered for Spieth\u2019s meltdown. Yet Willett had to be in position to pounce. \u201cIf I had been five over par it wouldn\u2019t have mattered what Jordan did,\u201d he rightly acknowledged.

Yet the daily obstacles facing Palestinian farmers in the West Bank are probably less well known. Whether their produce is destined for overseas consumers or for the 4.68 million Palestinians split between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, producers complain of issues including lack of access to water, unfair competition and delays in navigating border checkpoints.  A wide range of fresh produce can easily be grown in the West Bank, including many herbs and vegetables, dates, olives, citrus fruits, grapes, figs, melons and strawberries. However, with Israel and Egypt controlling all borders, Palestinian farmers must work within a fractured supply chain that reduces their competitiveness.   Related: Isis is strangling Syrian trade but a new orange co-operative is turning to Russia    \u201cOur trucks are not refrigerated because the West Bank is such a small area, so when they are stopped under the sun for long hours the fresh produce inside can lose its quality or even become inedible,\u201d says Mohammad, a farmer of mushrooms and other produce near Qalqilya in the northern West Bank who also complains about the difficulties in importing fertilisers and farming equipment. \u201cWe are surrounded by Israel,\u201d says Mohammad Abu Khizaran, a grower for Daraghmeh Co, which produces herbs year-round in Tubas, a city in the north-east of the West Bank, as part of a USAID-sponsored programme. \u201cGetting through the checkpoints takes time, so forecasting for the future, it is difficult to be accurate.\u201d The Daraghmeh co-operative\u2019s herbs travel by refrigerated truck to Amman airport in Jordan via the Israeli-controlled border. From there they are sent to markets in Europe, Russia and the US, as well as to Dubai.  Khizaran identifies access to water as the greatest challenge facing Palestinian farmers. According to the Palestinian Water Authority, average domestic, urban and industrial consumption in those parts of the West Bank connected to the water grid stood at 73 litres per capita per day in 2011, less than the WHO-recommended minimum of 100 litres.  In February, Tubas commenced construction on a wastewater treatment plant to provide treated water for agricultural use, but it will not be finished until September 2017. In the meantime, strict controls regulate consumption, with Palestinians prevented from digging new wells, according to a report from the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR).  The World Bank has highlighted the potential to significantly increase agricultural production in the region, estimating that irrigation could help boost the value of production in the West Bank by more than $1bn. At the same time, Israel has been criticised for announcing plans in January to appropriate a large tract of fertile land near Jericho in the east of the West Bank.  \u201cDuring the British mandate, Palestinian farmers exported many varieties of agricultural goods,\u201d says Wahbeh Asfour, project manager at the Ma\u2019an Development Center, which started the Kale Project to help grow more food in the West Bank. \u201cPre-occupation of 1967, the agriculture sector was the backbone of the local economy.\u201d      The Kale Project Photograph: The Kale Project    Asfour says that the Kale Project was partly a response to the failure of the international community and of donor-led projects to meet the dietary needs of Palestinians. It is hosted by the MA\u2019AN Permaculture Center, located near Jenin in northern West Bank, which provides a space for growing fresh, organic kale, which is then distributed locally and to nearby Ramallah. Kale was chosen as much for its suitability to the local conditions as for its nutritional value.    Related: Organic almonds sow hope in Palestine    However, the resources to grow this and other such projects are hard to come by. \u201cPalestinian growers face extreme challenges in both the research and implementation of agro-technologies,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is little access to the broader science available to Israelis with respect to water harvesting, organic farming mechanisms, seed regeneration and other methods.\u201d The problem, as Asfour sees it, is threefold: first, the occupation places control of all agricultural inputs in the hands of the Israelis; second is the international donor community, which he says has failed to prioritise aid for the agricultural sector; and third is the impotence of the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture. \u201cThe Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture has paid little to no attention to seeking and supporting emerging science related to agro-productivity and agro-technologies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Ministry is both donor-dependent on the international community, which fails to address the core needs of the sector, and paralysed via the occupation, which restricts access, mobility and resources.\u201d", "title": "The Palestinian farmers battling border restrictions and lack of water", "sentences": ["From there they are sent to markets in Europe, Russia and the US, as well as to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-04-12T04:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/12/vast-majority-young-arabs-isis-shunning-poll", "tags": ["Islamic State", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "Young people", "World news", "Islam", "United Arab Emirates", "Society", "Saudi Arabia", "Iran", "Syria", "Yemen", "Mosul"], "article": "The vast majority of young Arabs are increasingly rejecting Islamic State and believe the extremist group will fail to establish a caliphate, a  poll has found. Only 13% of Arab youths said they could imagine themselves supporting Isis even if it did not use much violence, down from 19% last year, while 50% saw it as the biggest problem facing the Middle East, up from 37% last year, according to the 2016 Arab Youth Survey. However, concern is mounting across the region as a chronic lack of jobs and opportunities were cited as the principal factor feeding terrorist recruitment. In eight of the 16 countries surveyed, employment problems were a bigger pull factor for Isis than extreme religious views. The eighth annual survey provides a snapshot of the aspirations of 200 million people. It found that five years after the start of the Arab spring, most youngsters prioritise stability over democracy. Optimism that the region would be better off in the wake of the 2011 uprisings has been steadily declining.   Related: My Arab Spring: 'I envisioned a new Syria, but it never materialised'    In 2016, only 36% of young people said they felt the Arab world was in better shape following the upheaval, down from 72% in 2012. The majority (53%) agreed that maintaining stability was more important than promoting democracy (28%). In 2011, 92% of Arab youth said \u201cliving in a democracy\u201d was their most cherished wish. Concern about poor job prospects was observed across the Arab world, where one in four 15- to 24-year-olds are jobless \u2013 the highest youth unemployment on the planet, according to World Bank. The International Labour Organisation believes up to 75 million young people are without a job in Arab countries. The Arab Youth Survey was based on 3,500 interviews across a range of issues with respondents aged 18 to 24. It found that 47% believed Sunni-Shia relations were deteriorating and 52% felt religion played too big a role in a region dominated by Saudi Arabia and Iran \u2013 respective cheerleaders for each sect and on opposite sides of the wars in Syria and Yemen. Overall, 39% of Arab youth viewed the bloody conflict in Syria as a proxy war fought by regional and global powers, 29% saw it as a revolution against the Bashar al-Assad regime, and 22% believed it was a civil war among Syrians. Nearly half of those polled supported the 2015 international nuclear deal that ended sanctions and brought Iran in from the cold \u2013 in striking contrast to the hostility of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf governments. Divisions were also evident in Arab youth perceptions of the US, with 63% considering it an ally and 32% as an enemy. Lack of democracy was cited as the biggest obstacle facing the Middle East by 22%, compared with 50% pointing to the rise of Isis. But two-thirds of young Arabs (67%) still wanted their leaders to do more to improve their personal freedoms and the human rights of citizens, particularly women. The survey by the PR consultancy Asda\u2019a Burson-Marsteller, which has an office in Dubai, found that the United Arab Emirates is viewed by young Arabs as \u201ca model country\u201d that is economically secure, and is the most favoured nation to live in and set up a business.  Nearly one in four (22%) cited the UAE \u2013 a federation of hereditary sheikhdoms without elected representative institutions \u2013 as the country they would most like to live in. A similar number said it is the nation they would most like their own country to emulate (23%). Respondents were not asked specifically about abuses that are regularly highlighted by international human rights watchdogs. The survey found 66% of Arab youth were increasingly concerned about falling oil prices, though 78% still believed they were entitled to subsidised energy \u2013 despite plummeting revenues. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer, is struggling to undertake large-scale economic reforms in response. More young Arabs get their daily news online than from TV or print media, according to the survey \u2013 while 32% said they get their daily news online, 29% watch TV news and just 7% read newspapers daily (down from 13% in 2015). \u2022 The Arab Youth Survey 2016 is carried out by international polling firm Penn Schoen Berland for Asda\u2019a Burson-Marsteller.

The notes of the annual, which is published on Thursday, credits the appointment of Andrew Strauss as the director of England cricket last May among a number of decisions that gave the senior men\u2019s side a sense of direction and saw performances in both Test cricket, where the Ashes were regained at home and South Africa beaten away, and the limited overs formats taking a dramatic upturn.   Related: Stuart Broad hits zone at Trent Bridge to send Australia batsmen into twilight | Andy Bull    \u201cRecords fell like confetti,\u201d writes the editor Lawrence Booth. \u201cEngland passed 400 for the first time in a one-day international, and knocked off 350 in another. They made their highest one-day score overseas, in Dubai [355 for five], then smashed it a few weeks later, in Bloemfontein [399 for nine]. Jos Buttler scored a hundred off 66 balls, then \u2013 as if to make up for his tardiness \u2013 off 46. \u201cStuart Broad took eight for 15 as Australia were demolished for 60 at Trent Bridge, then six for 17 to skittle South Africa for 83 at Johannesburg. The two most resonant national records fell one after the other: in Antigua, Jimmy Anderson overtook Ian Botham\u2019s Test-wickets haul, and went on past 400; at Leeds, Alastair Cook surpassed Graham Gooch\u2019s Test-runs tally, and approached 10,000.\u201d Such good-news stories contrasted with what had occurred the year before, the Test side having stuttered in their rebuilding process following the 2013\u201114 Ashes whitewash and the one-day team tumbling out of the 2015 World Cup at the group stage \u2013 something of an ignominious achievement given the format of the tournament. Strauss, whose first act was to remove Peter Moores as head coach, earns praise for appointing Trevor Bayliss in his place, and thus reuniting the Australian with his former assistant coach Paul Farbrace, who had enjoyed a bright spell in temporary charge of the team during the interim period in which New Zealand toured. \u201cForget leather on willow. The sound of the English game in early 2015 was palm on forehead. [But] in a delightful turn-up for the form guide, the ECB \u2013 having spent the previous year losing touch with reality \u2013 were making some smart decisions,\u201d Booth writes. \u201cVictory at the Wanderers in January 2016, to knock South Africa off the top of the Test rankings, confirmed that a different kind of hope had taken hold. It was the most uplifting story in international cricket all year, the more so for being utterly unexpected.\u201d Elsewhere, the all-rounder Ben Stokes, who embodied this change in outlook, is named as one of Wisden\u2019s five cricketers of the year along with Jonny Bairstow, following a summer in which the right-hander\u2019s staggering form for Yorkshire during their successful County Championship defence earned him a Test recall midway through the 3-2 Ashes win. The Australian batsman Steve Smith, top-scorer in that series with 508 runs, is also included in the five, as are the early-summer tourists Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson of New Zealand. \u201cAn English summer has rarely witnessed a more popular touring captain,\u201d says Booth of McCullum, while praising his team-mate as \u201cconsistency personified, and beautiful to watch\u201d. Williamson is also named as Wisden\u2019s Leading Cricketer in the World for 2015, having amassed 2,692 international runs across all formats, a full 323 ahead of second-placed Steve Smith, while a third Kiwi, the all-rounder Suzie Bates, is awarded the Leading Woman Cricketer in the World. \u201cIt needed something special to deny both Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry this award, and Bates\u2019s all-round performances were precisely that.\u201d Off the field, Wisden notes that the \u201cage of the Big Three may be over before it has properly begun\u201d in observing that the architects of the 2014 reforms of the International Cricket Council, which saw India, Australia and England take control of the governing body and allocate themselves 52% of revenues generated by global events, have nearly all left the stage. The book also urges countries around the world to give day/night Test cricket a chance following the first such match between Australia and New Zealand in Adelaide last November, arguing that \u201cif it takes off everywhere, boards can use the extra revenue to prove to their stars that they needn\u2019t become soulless freelancers, forever scouring the globe for their next fix\u201d.", "title": "Wisden 2016: Stokes, Bairstow, Smith, McCullum and Williamson are players of the year", "sentences": ["They made their highest one-day score overseas, in Dubai [355 for five], then smashed it a few weeks later, in Bloemfontein [399 for nine]."], "publicationDate": "2016-04-13T07:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/13/novak-djokovic-defeat-monte-carlo-masters-jiri-vesely", "tags": ["Novak Djokovic", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "What started out as another quiet day in paradise turned into a rolling parade of shocks and minor surprises: Novak Djokovic beaten for only the second time in 30 matches this year, and Aljaz Bedene targeting Rafael Nadal\u2019s once-feared forehand on clay, before losing anyway.   Related: Rafael Nadal beats Aljaz Bedene in straight sets at Monte Carlo Masters    Elsewhere, Maria Sharapova was left in legal limbo about making a comeback, thanks to a barely comprehensible statement from the World Anti-Doping Agency that at first suggested she might be granted a reprieve for failing a drugs test at the Australian Open. However, she has yet to establish when she took the banned drug meldonium and in what strength. Lawyers are consulting. By the Mediterranean, Djokovic, the world No1 with a grip on the game as tight as a boa constrictor, leaves a tournament earlier than he has done since the second round in Madrid three years agoin 2013, after Jiri Vesely, 55 in the world, produced the performance of his short career to win 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, his first victory over a top-10 player in nine attempts. Fighting hard for every point in the afternoon sun, Vesely served for their second-round match after two hours. An outrageous dropshot from the baseline helped him on his way and the joy on his face when the Serb\u2019s final forehand drifted long was a picture Caravaggio might have painted. The 22-year-old Czech now takes Djokovic\u2019s all-but-nailed-on place at the top end of the draw. The Serb\u2019s earlier defeat this year was an injury retirement when trailing Feliciano L\u00f3pez 3-6 in Dubai. His last genuine loss was in Cincinnati last year when Roger Federer, charging the net like an excitable youth, took him out in two sets in the final. \u201cNobody\u2019s unbeatable,\u201d the surprisingly upbeat loser said. \u201cI was playing really, really bad. Bad footwork. But I have to congratulate my opponent. \u201cHe played very solid. He was serving very big. He was playing tactically good and aggressive. When he was break up in the third set, he was playing bravely. He was coming in, dropshots, big serves. He was going for it. He deserved to have it.\u201d The now-no-longer defending champion returned to his home here 10 days ago to prepare, so could not complain about lack of practice \u2013 although he has been busy off-court too, and entertained friends and some players, including Andy Murray, at the opening of his new restaurant on Sunday night. He nonetheless will put the setback behind him and remains upbeat about his chances of winning the one slam that has eluded him, the French Open, which starts next month. But what of the one-time king of that tournament, Nadal? If Murray plays the Spaniard in the semi-finals here, he is likely to encounter a considerably less threatening opponent than the one who strung together eight consecutive Monte Carlo titles.   Related: Andy Murray and Dominic Inglot make quarter-finals of Monte Carlo doubles    The Scot first has to get past the Frenchman Beno\u00eet Paire on Thursday \u2013 with Tomas Berdych a surprise loser in his section of the draw on Tuesday, and Milos Raonic still a potential roadblock \u2013 but he will be encouraged by Nadal\u2019s sub-standard win against Bedene. Nadal spent only an hour and 19 minutes beating Bedene 6-3, 6-3 on Court Rainier III but he struggled at key moments, looking laboured in the shot and generally out of sorts. What stunned the Spaniard was the British No2\u2019s nagging attack to his own forehand, once considered tennis suicide. But, as Bedene explained later, \u201cI didn\u2019t play my best tennis. And seeing him struggling on the forehand side, I was trying to change a bit because I know, like, a few years ago when he was ripping his forehand, that was his best shot. But now when you press his forehand, that\u2019s his weaker side.\u201d It is inconceivable anyone would have uttered those words even a couple of years ago but it is plain that Nadal at 30 is in a real fight to turn his career around after so many years alongside Federer, Djokovic and Murray. Bedene added: \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling great. Got injections in my back in the morning because couldn\u2019t do much without [them]. At the beginning I was struggling a bit. He was playing decent ball. His spin gets you way back. But from 1-5 down, I was playing my tennis, got into the match. I had a breakback point for 4-5. I didn\u2019t use it, didn\u2019t play to capacity. I knew he was struggling there. If I had broken there, it would have been interesting.\u201d It was anyway, for all sorts of reasons. It is not often you see two giants of the era in trouble on the same day. Now the door is ajar for Murray. He has never played Paire but he always does his homework. Raonic, who took three sets to beat Pablo Cuevas in two hours and 35 minutes still ought to have enough left to get past the 23-year-old Bosnian Damir Dzumhur, who beat Berdych 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3 in about the same time.

While Short surely regrets ignoring the pleas of Dick Advocaat, Allardyce\u2019s predecessor, for a radical squad overhaul last summer, many close to both clubs still cannot quite understand how he over-promoted the inexperienced Margaret Byrne to the post of Sunderland\u2019s chief executive or why Ashley places so much faith in Lee Charnley. Like Byrne, the latter is well-liked in football circles and his astonishing rise from a junior clerical position at St James\u2019 to CEO remains, in one sense, refreshing. Yet, like his now-departed former Wearside counterpart, Charnley has some serious questions to address. Foremost among them is why he waited so long to challenge the Sports Direct owner\u2019s strategy of recruiting only players aged under 26 from \u201cbetter value\u201d leagues while selling Newcastle to their agents as a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to Europe\u2019s elite clubs. This season alone Graham Carr, Newcastle\u2019s 71-year-old scout, helped invest \u00a380m of Newcastle\u2019s money on the largely underachieving Florian Thauvin (swiftly loaned back to Marseille), Aleksandar Mitrovic, Georginio Wijnaldum, Chancel Mbemba, Jonjo Shelvey, Henri Saivet and Andros Townsend. Unfortunately the squad remains so unbalanced that Ben\u00edtez lacks specialist full-backs and swiftly scrapped the tentative idea of experimenting with a back three against Swansea after realising he had only two fit centre-halves. Equally damningly, the team still crave streetwise on-pitch leaders. \u201cWe have quality but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d says Wijnaldum, tellingly. \u201cYou have to be all together and do it as a team. As a team you can win games.\u201d Considering Newcastle have recorded only six league victories all season, the omens are not good. If only Ashley had listened to Steve McClaren \u2013 replaced by Ben\u00edtez last month \u2013 when the former coach publicly challenged the \u201c25 and under\u201d policy last autumn. Instead McClaren received an official warning. The former England coach\u2019s ambitious plan to implement a patient passing game capable of transforming his team into Barcelona-on-Tyne may have been ill-advised but a lack of autonomy ultimately undid him. Unwilling to stand for any such nonsense Ben\u00edtez has belatedly been afforded the control McClaren and Alan Pardew were denied. Indeed Ashley is so desperate to keep the Spaniard that he has offered him carte blanche to conduct a long overdue root-and-branch reform at a club where the struggling under-21 and under-18 sides have each registered just a single victory during 2016. The only problem is that relegation may dictate Ben\u00edtez will no longer be around to oversee change next season. The drop could also spell the end for Allardyce at Sunderland, with much hinging on the financial response of an owner whose reaction to the Adam Johnson debacle has been to keep his head well below the parapet. By resigning in the wake of the winger\u2019s imprisonment for child sex offences Byrne \u2013 privy to too many details of the case not to have suspended Johnson immediately when he was charged \u2013 arguably took a bullet for the board. Allardyce quickly persuaded Short to scrap Sunderland\u2019s failed director of football system and spent \u00a315m wisely on Wahbi Khazri, Lamine Kon\u00e9 and Jan Kirchhoff in January. The subsequent improvement is tangible but slow. So slow he fears his installation, last October, came too late to reverse the damage already done by a toxic, Newcastle-esque blend of boardroom arrogance and complacency.", "title": "Familiar tale in two cities has led Newcastle and Sunderland to the edge | Louise Taylor", "sentences": ["Within seconds a rapidly accelerating, Dubai-bound, Emirates Boeing 777 hurtled past."], "publicationDate": "2016-04-15T18:35:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/16/doug-schoninger-us-pro-rugby", "tags": ["Rugby union", "USA rugby union team", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "From the 36th floor of One Penn Plaza, where Doug Schoninger keeps an office, the view is simply extraordinary. The skyscrapers of Manhattan spread away to the south. To the west, the glittering Hudson and the Statue of Liberty herself. But then, in New York City, such views are ten a penny.   Related: US professional rugby a step closer as five teams begin training for kick-off    In the United States of America, so are professional sports leagues. From Sunday, Schoninger will have one of his own: PRO Rugby. Starting a pro sports league in America in a little under a year is a remarkable feat. Success will be more remarkable still. The NBA and NHL are entering the playoffs, MLB and MLS are hitting their stride, the NFL casts its shadow over all. The sports pages and airwaves are full. Still, five teams \u2013 Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego, Denver and Ohio \u2013 will play until July. All players will be centrally contracted. There will be tweaks to the laws \u2013 including no draws. Games will be broadcast free around the globe on aol.com and by ONE World Sports on cable. And Schoninger, successful on Wall Street in high-yield bonds and in stadium financing, is paying. By some metrics rugby union is the fastest growing sport in America. But America does not know rugby. So this begs the question: if San Francisco score a great try at Sacramento but everyone is elsewhere, watching the Golden State Warriors set the court on fire, will they make a sound? Not for the first or last time in a hugely genial, hour-long conversation, Schoninger raps the table for emphasis, Francis Underwood-style. \u201cI know one thing: if the fans don\u2019t engage then I\u2019m probably doing something wrong. This is fan-centric \u2013 in the sports business you work for the fans and if there aren\u2019t any fans, you aren\u2019t working for anyone.\u201d Ticket sales for the first two games have been \u201csporadic\u201d. But that\u2019s OK, he says. Schoninger seems to see what others call problems \u2013 brief build time, his own newness to the game, an uncertain public \u2013 and co-opt them as strengths. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK\u201d could be his most-used expression. This is PRO Rugby\u2019s \u201cbeta\u201d year, he says, in which things can be expected to fail.    I don\u2019t want to give people things they don\u2019t want and I don\u2019t know if they want rugby. I'm trying to wake people up  Doug Schoninger     \u201cI don\u2019t want to give people things that they don\u2019t want and I don\u2019t know if they want [rugby] or not. But I\u2019m trying to wake people up: if you really want it, do it. Don\u2019t come back in a couple years and say \u2018I wish I had supported more, now it\u2019s gone.\u2019 Schoninger is not saying he will be gone in two years, although with no big sponsorship or media deals his \u201cpockets are getting lighter and lighter\u201d. He has said elsewhere that he\u2019s committed for three, after which he may or may not consider other investors. Either way, Schoninger thinks the key is to knit his league into the roots of the game, where he hopes to find a young audience that knows rugby from school, college or club. Hence social media-heavy promotion.  Hence too the use of small stadiums in rugby hotbeds, mostly in the west, the east not yet providing suitable venues with surfaces that meet World Rugby regulation 22. Again, Schoninger seeks to make a virtue of it, and not just because on opening weekend it will be \u201craining in Denver but 80 degrees and sunny in Sacramento\u201d.     MetLife Stadium, home of the New York Giants. Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP    \u201cYou need to embrace who you are and keep that smallness, right? I don\u2019t think I ever want to be in a stadium bigger than 10 or 12,000. That can be an asset for us. If we try to go big we lose the contest with the NFL, no question.\u201d Schoninger sometimes gives the impression he is thinking out loud. But he knows some things for sure. He knows he can\u2019t compete with the NFL. After all, he has Giants tickets. \u201cTo me what\u2019s importance in all sports is closeness to the pitch,\u201d he says, \u201ceven if it\u2019s football. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like MetLife: the old Giants stadium was half the size but only had 5,000 fewer seats. Now I get that: most people are going now for the experience, the colosseum, the feel. But if you\u2019re going for sport it\u2019s not a good place to watch. We have to keep that. We have to keep sport.\u201d     Boxer Stadium \u2013 now home to professional rugby union. Photograph: Michael P Gonos    In the case of American rugby, Schoninger says, sport means values and the values of rugby are \u201cblue collar\u201d: honesty, toil, teamwork, reward. He tells a story about one venue, Boxer Stadium in San Francisco. For a while it seemed the parks department was not going to move the Gaelic football posts that stood at each end of the field. \u201cThose posts are set back, 10 yards from the pitch. So I told them we\u2019d just move each penalty 10 yards closer, right?\u201d He laughs. And though Boxer is somewhat basic \u2013 \u201cthe locker rooms are just unbearable, they\u2019re teenie and they\u2019re gross\u201d \u2013 Schoninger says his players took one look and said: \u201cThis is great. This is who we are. We\u2019re gritty, we\u2019re raw, screw those fancy San Diego guys\u2026\u201d Is this the birth of a hundred-year rugby rivalry, something to rival Leicester-Northampton, Auckland-Canterbury, England-Scotland? He laughs again. \u201cYou make do, you know?\u201d Some of PRO Rugby\u2019s players will. Salaries range from $35,000 to match fees only. International players \u2013 Mils Muliaina in San Francisco, Pedrie Wannenburg in Denver and Mirco Bergamasco in Sacramento are the most capped \u2013 are tasked with helping local talent grow. \u201cI went to Sacramento,\u201d Schoninger says, \u201cand I met a squad of players. That\u2019s the only squad I have met so far in full. That\u2019s when it becomes real. You\u2019ve got this extended family. People have flown, you know? I thought, \u2018Oh God, I hope I don\u2019t disappoint.\u2019 \u201cBut you know, you do the best you can do. And that doesn\u2019t mean throwing money at every problem. It means making the right decisions based on the right data.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022     The Sacramento PRO Rugby squad pose \u2013 in 80F and sunshine \u2013 for a preseason photo. Photograph: PRO Rugby     Related: USA third place at Dubai Sevens gives notice of growing stake in global game | Martin Pengelly    Schoninger\u2019s conversion to rugby grew out of money and data. He was looking to buy a major sports team. None were available. But then, one day not much more than a year ago, he found himself having breakfast at Rosemary\u2019s on Greenwich Avenue. Across the table was a promoter who wanted to bring pro rugby to America. The plan involved hundreds of millions of dollars and teams dropped into big stadiums. To Schoninger, though he did not know much about rugby, it didn\u2019t seem right. But he was intrigued, enough to fly to Chicago in November 2014 to see the US Eagles take a beating from the mighty All Blacks. Soon he was introduced to Nigel Melville, chief executive of USA Rugby. On 21 April 2015 World Rugby and USA Rugby gave Schoninger sanction to operate America\u2019s first pro league. The 11 months since have been full of hard work. A lot of it has been political. American rugby contains other operations, all ambitious. When it comes to professional rugby, most want in. When it comes to PRO Rugby, some want out. Schoninger has been criticised for his perceived rush to play, for being an outsider, for communicating too much or too little. At seminars, socials and dinners his tan linen jacket has become a common sight, as he stoops to answer questions. \u201cSome of it\u2019s very helpful,\u201d he says, \u201cand some of it\u2019s very negative, as a newbie.\u201d He continues, with an air of bemusement: \u201cOne thing that was very representative was [criticism] about the uniforms. It was that it\u2019s a bicycle company\u201d \u2013 Champion System \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s making them. And my point is, \u2018And your point is?\u2019 \u201cCycling has done an incredible job in England and America. If we get some of those fans? Great.\u201d The plan is that the public will help shape their team\u2019s name, crest and colours. It\u2019s all part, Schoninger says, of an attempt to turn \u201camateur supporters into professional fans\u201d.    I was reading a report. There are 4.2 million fans of rugby in the US and 16 million supporters \u2026 Gimme their addresses!  Doug Schoninger     \u201cI defined our mission at the beginning as rugby being brought into the public culture,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we\u2019ve accomplished a little bit of that. Obviously the Olympics is going to help too. But to me the ultimate goal is that we enter the conversation of being a real American sport. It\u2019s great that rugby\u2019s growing fast but it\u2019s from a very low base. We\u2019re still very small. \u201cBut then, it\u2019s funny. I was reading a report [by SMG Insight] the other day and it was well done, and it said there are 4.2 million fans of rugby in the US and 16 million supporters. I\u2019d like to know where they are \u2013 gimme their addresses!\u201d He is not the only one who would like them. In March, Premier Rugby landed London Irish and Saracens in New Jersey. The game was proclaimed a success. \u201cI thought the Irish-Saracens game was wrong,\u201d Schoninger says. \u201cYou don\u2019t take two teams from a different country and plop them into a place. \u201cThe argument that the NFL does it is a bad argument. England doesn\u2019t play American football \u2013 they\u2019re not insulting anyone. And they\u2019re not spending the money the NFL has spent to activate in England, and for the NFL it\u2019s been years and years. It\u2019s not a new thing. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s a bit of hubris in the way that they did it, and what works better is you engage with US rugby. I think most of the English clubs get that \u2013 I\u2019m not sure Premier Rugby does.  \u201cBut then, what\u2019s good for rugby is good for me. So I hope everyone\u2019s successful. There\u2019s just several ways to do it, I guess.\u201d     Infinity Park in Glendale, Colorado \u2013 the first purpose-built rugby stadium in the US. Photograph: Andy Cross/Denver Post via Getty Images     Related: London Irish and Saracens off to a flying start in the United States    Such arguments will run and run. Schoninger, who is his own media manager, will likely be part of them. For now, he is focusing on Sunday in Sacramento. \u201cI\u2019m flying Saturday morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI get there midday, I\u2019ve got some meetings and stuff. The New York Times is finishing up a report, CNN International is doing their rugby show there that week, we\u2019ve got a lot of journalists due, local and non-local. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll just try not to pan\u2026 \u201d He bursts out laughing, again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The die is cast at this point. There\u2019s not much we can do. We\u2019ll go for a good dinner, wake up the next morning\u2026 the game\u2019s not till the afternoon. I can\u2019t watch the Denver game on TV since it\u2019s not on TV, so I guess I\u2019ll be on the phone. And we\u2019ll hope for the best, you know?

If you follow a team the chances are you have suffered it at some point or another and, as Aston Villa\u2019s supporters can probably testify, it does not matter how prepared you think you might be, or how many times it might have happened in the past, it is still a desperately numbing feeling when the guillotine falls and the players are wandering around, like zombies, not knowing where to rest their eyes.   Related: Aston Villa fans fury over Joleon Lescott\u2019s \u2018relegation a relief\u2019 comment    \u201cI\u2019ve seen childbirth twice and relegation five times,\u201d Pete May, the author of several books on West Ham, once wrote. \u201cChildbirth does look very painful but it lasts only a few hours. The pain of relegation lasts all summer and beyond. Plus childbirth at least results in something positive. With relegation, you\u2019re always worried that it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d It often does, as Leicester City can corroborate bearing in mind the previous ordeals encountered by the champions-in-waiting and what those experiences tell Villa about the potential for more unravelling. Leicester\u2019s last demotion from the Premier League, in 2004, was followed by successive finishes of 15th, 16th and 19th in the Championship and then another deterioration in their fourth season at that level \u2013 to 22nd and a place in League One. Nottingham Forest have spent time in the third best division in English football or, put another way, the second worst. Leeds United have been down there and David Bernstein, one of the executives Villa have hired to try to halt the downward spiral, will know the dangers from first-hand experience if we go back to his days as Manchester City chairman and an era of Richard Edghill, Ged Brannan and Lee Bradbury rather than Vincent Kompany, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Ag\u00fcero. City went two leagues down before coming back up and when the fingers of relegation closed around their neck for a second time the Manchester Evening News carried a photograph of a young supporter wiping away tears with a flag. Bernstein asked for a copy of that picture and hung it in the boardroom at Maine Road. It was a reminder, he used to tell guests, that the club must never put their fans through the same again.   Related: Aston Villa relegated from Premier League after defeat by Manchester United    Bernstein also wrote to the club\u2019s season-ticket holders to apologise \u2013 which is the least that Villa should be doing \u2013 while City, the official club magazine, attempted to lift the mood in an article entitled: \u201cReasons to be cheerful\u201d. These included \u201cfun weekends at a variety of coastal resorts like Blackpool and Bournemouth\u201d, the prospect of \u201cred-hot Lancashire derbies against grand old names like Burnley and Preston North End\u201d and, best of all, the \u201cchance to snuggle up together in the \u2018cosy\u2019 stands we\u2019ll be visiting on our away trips\u201d. Among them, Lincoln City, Macclesfield Town and York City. Villa are not quite that broken but, equally, it is difficult finding any reasons for them to be cheerful when Walsall and Burton Albion could conceivably be on their list of derbies next season and the stench of disillusionment, built up over six years of drift, listless performances and boardroom buffoonery, has become so overpowering it is difficult to imagine that fumigating the place will be a quick fix. The financial impact, even taking into account the parachute money from the Premier League, means losing upwards of \u00a3200m merely from television revenue if they cannot find a way back during the next three years. The new television deal comes into force in August and will be worth \u00a38.3bn over that time. Then factor in the lost ticket revenue, sponsorship and other forms of income. However it is dressed up, there has never been a worse time for relegation. All of which leaves Villa in a harrowing position, bearing in mind the size and history of the place and the feeling I still get, 25 years after walking down Witton Lane for the first time, that the imposing red-brick walls, the steps leading to the Holte End, the statues of the lions, the colours and the noise make Villa Park one of football\u2019s special monuments. The club have, if nothing else, recognised that it is not just the playing staff that has to be overhauled and begun the process by bringing in Bernstein as well as a new chairman, Steve Hollis, and creating new positions on the board for Brian Little, a former Villa player and manager, and Adrian Bevington, previously of the Football Association. That, at least, is a start and few will miss the former chief executive, Tom Fox, or the sporting director, Hendrik Almstadt, who has also been ushered off the premises. All the same, there is an awful lot of work to be done when, trying to make sense of the Randy Lerner era, there is a jarring irony that they have just lopped off the word \u201cPrepared\u201d from their expensively redesigned club crest (Villa having spent more on that badge and all the necessary changes than Lerner was apparently prepared to pay for any players in January to get them out of this hole). One long-serving employee was asked recently to undertake a quiz on Villa\u2019s history to convince the people above her that she should keep her job. In total, there could be 100 job losses and it will be intriguing to see whether Paddy Riley, the former video analyst who now goes by the title of director of scouting and recruitment, is spared. Riley\u2019s transfer record hardly eases the suspicion that he has been overpromoted and there is an excruciating story about what happened when the agent of one signing turned up to negotiate the contract. Riley had been put in charge along with the club secretary, Sharon Barnhurst, and the agent was so unimpressed by the absence of more senior staff he is said to have taken one look and walked out in a fit of pique. Riley did, in fairness, persuade him to return. Nigel Pearson is an obvious candidate for the manager\u2019s job but there are no indications that Lerner is any closer to finding a buyer and, in the meantime, the bottom line is that Villa have become a tragicomedy, on and off the pitch. One of the club\u2019s European scouts, with responsibility for Spain and Portugal, turns out to be a journalism student. Another is said to have emigrated to Australia earlier this season, at a time when his role was apparently to cover the Bundesliga. As for the players, what does it say for Gabriel Agbonlahor \u2013 born in Birmingham, affiliated to Villa since a young age and someone, you might assume, who would give everything for his club \u2013 that he is so bereft of professional decency he has just been placed on a two-week fitness programme because he cannot even keep himself in shape? Agbonlahor, with one goal all season, spent the last international break partying in Dubai. His attitude is symptomatic of the culture of drift and, if Villa have serious aspirations of restoring some dignity, this summer might be a good time to thank him for happier days and cut him loose. It is a tremendous mess and, plainly, it is easier for Lerner to avoid awkward questions about his culpability when the other option is to keep his distance, holed away in the Hamptons, and communicate in occasional statements via the club\u2019s website. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone else in Cleveland sports in the last 30 years who rode into town with similar fanfare and delivered so little in comparison,\u201d Bill Livingston, the American sportswriter, once wrote of Lerner\u2019s time in charge of the Cleveland Browns, and Villa\u2019s followers will note the similarities. \u201cThe biggest constant among those Randy hired was a lack of judgment,\u201d Livingston concluded. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a good owner by any means, but he wasn\u2019t a lucky one, either.\u201d One day, maybe, the subject of all this criticism will be decent enough to answer the principal charge that he simply went cold on Villa, having been unable to break into the Champions League positions in his early years, and withdrew to a point that it became inevitable stagnation would follow.   Related: David Squires on \u2026\u00a0Aston Villa's miserable season    Not the most important thing right now, perhaps, but Lerner could also explain why Fox\u2019s annual salary was almost five times higher than that of the previous chief executive, Paul Faulkner, up from \u00a3265,792 to \u00a31,255,769. Maybe he could let us know whether it was really necessary to have 496 members of staff, the sixth highest in the league, compared with, say, Tottenham Hotspur (380), Newcastle United (288) and Everton (274), and more than the combined workforce of West Ham (250) and Leicester (188). And maybe, like Bernstein all those years ago, he might want to apologise to all those supporters who suspected this mismanagement and apathy would take them only one direction. Kevin doesn\u2019t need friends like these The decision to remove Kevin Friend from refereeing duties for Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s visit to Stoke City on Monday was always bewildering but especially now it transpires that he is apparently a Bristol City supporter. Friend lives in Leicester and, by his own admission, has been to watch Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team this season, but taking him off a game because a few daft people think he will deliberately give decisions against Spurs sets a dangerous precedent, as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has stated, and it all seems particularly unnecessary when the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has made it clear he had no issue whatsoever with the original choice of officials. Friend\u2019s treatment comes across as a lack of trust from the organisation that employs him \u2013 even if, conversely, the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd will argue the decision was taken to protect him - and if it is true that it stemmed from a social\u2011media campaign from Spurs fans (one that certainly passed me by) should the decision-makers really be pandering to the Twitter orchestra? Sure enough, there are now Everton supporters questioning the appointment of Anthony Taylor for their team\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United on the basis that he lives in Altrincham, just a few miles from Old Trafford. Already, it has been noted that Michael Oliver \u2013 a Newcastle supporter, apparently \u2013 refereed Norwich\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last weekend and turned down a penalty appeal that might have led to the game being drawn and, in turn, ultimately benefited his own club. Nobody had given it a second thought until now but no doubt there will be fans of other clubs scouring referees\u2019 profiles to come up with historic grievances or flimsy arguments why further restrictions should be placed. A different case could be highlighted every week and the referees are probably entitled to wonder why their organisation has given credence to a fuss about nothing. PFA awards fail to tell whole story The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association holds its player of the year awards next weekend and it would be a surprise, looking back at the last eight months, if the prize went to anyone bar one of the three Leicester City players \u2013 Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 \u2013 on the six\u2011man shortlist. What, though, if Leicester suddenly implode from this point onwards and Harry Kane\u2019s goals take Tottenham Hotspur to the title? Who would ultimately be the more deserving player? It is certainly strange that the PFA holds this event a month before the season has finished and even more so that the voting slips had an 8 April deadline but actually started coming back at the beginning of March, when some teams still had 10 games to play. In 2016, is it really beyond Gordon Taylor and his colleagues to hold the event at the end of the season and find an online voting system that means the award is for the full campaign?", "title": "Randy Lerner\u2019s Aston Villa head for relegation woefully unprepared | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["Agbonlahor, with one goal all season, spent the last international break partying in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-04-16T19:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/18/mark-wood-england-cricket-ankle-surgery", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Durham", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Mark Wood has learned he requires a second operation on his troublesome left ankle, with the England and Durham fast bowler facing up to eight weeks out of action as a result.

Shahrzad is drawing huge audiences in a country where independent online series, produced privately, are becoming increasingly popular as people turn their backs on tightly controlled state television for online substitutes or illegal satellite channels. Like most films made in Iran, Shahrzad has already been approved by the censors \u2013 every single scene, each dialogue and costume has been carefully examined to make sure it adheres to the norms. The result, however, is a series that treads a fine line, even even at times showing the generally unshowable, such as women singing.     In the TV drama, Shahrzad is forced to marry against her wishes. Photograph: Amirhossein Shojaee/shahrzadseries.com    And out of a depiction of Iran under the late shah\u2019s despotic rule comes a drama that draws many parallels to politics in the country today.  Directed by Hasan Fathi and written jointly with playwright and university professor Naghmeh Samini, Shahrzad is the story of a love broken apart by events in the aftermath of the 1953 coup that overthrew the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq. That coup, engineered by the CIA and British intelligence to safeguard the west\u2019s oil interests, consolidated the shah\u2019s rule until the 1979 Islamic revolution. It was a defining moment in Iran\u2019s modern history, the reverberations of which are still felt today.  Shahrzad, a medical student, and Farhad, a journalist, often meet at the Cafe Naderi, a hub for intellectuals in the city. Farhad, an ardent supporter of Mosaddeq, is jailed after the shah\u2019s security forces close down his newspaper. Shahrzad, meanwhile, is forced to marry against her wishes and become the second wife of the son-in-law of Bozorg-Agha, a hugely influential Godfather-like figure who is close to the shah. But the forced marriage does not separate the pair.      The series portrays the crackdown that took place at the hands of the Shah\u2019s forces. Photograph: Amirhossein Shojaee/shahrzadseries.com    The series portrays the repression that took place at the hands of the shah\u2019s forces, with journalists and intellectuals summoned, intimidated or jailed arbitrarily and newspaper licences revoked. Those scenes strike a chord in today\u2019s Iran, in the light of more recent crackdowns against journalists and activists, especially after the 2009 post-election unrest.  Not all historical references in Shahrzad are accurate, says film critic Parviz Jahed, but \u201cgood storytelling has made it an intriguing and successful melodrama set against the backdrop of an important episode in Iran\u2019s modern history\u201d.  \u201cThere are things that are absent from a state TV production, such as the displaying of music instruments or women singing, but you\u2019ll see them in Shahrzad,\u201d he said. \u201cThese series made outside the state TV apparatus and produced privately are a new phenomenon.\u201d Shahrzad is not solely critiquing Iran\u2019s past politics, but also subtly highlighting beliefs and norms considered wrong and anachronistic that are nonetheless still present in Iranian lives. Striking, too, is the fact that some of its characters, such as Bozorg-Agha, who is allied to the shah, are not depicted in an unambiguously negative way.      Scenes that include musical instruments are normally absent from state TV productions. Photograph: Amirhossein Shojaee/shahrzadseries.com    \u201cIn the past, you couldn\u2019t approach such characters in a humanising way, but characters such as Bozorg-Agha at times even evoke sympathy and that\u2019s something new,\u201d Jahed said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t show charismatic figures in bad characters previously.\u201d   Related: Sanctions, misunderstanding and religion: 100 Iranians give their view    Each episode of Shahrzad is sold on a weekly basis on its website. It is also available from shops across the country on DVDs. Producers have been urging Iranians to respect copyright and not buy pirated versions. But in a country where copyright is widely violated with regard to artistic works, that is a huge challenge.  The success of Shahrzad comes at a time when Iran\u2019s fight against illegal satellite dishes appears to have been lost. Turkish soap operas, transmitted by companies such as Dubai-based GEM TV, are extremely popular in the country, where Farsi-dubbed versions showing love triangles, such The Tulip Age, are even available on USB sticks.  Observers say the extent to which the authorities appear to have tolerated red lines being crossed in Shahrzad appears to indicates a new, more flexible approach by the authorities. Although ordinary people don\u2019t have access to Netflix, mainly because of issues relating to Iranians\u2019 access to foreign payments, its TV series like Breaking Bad are popular in Iran. \u201cMost people have seen series like Breaking Bad or Fargo in Iran; they are dubbed in Farsi on the black market,\u201d Jahed said. \u201cThat\u2019s made it difficult for the Iranian filmmakers.

Since then, pressure on the governments of Qatar \u2013 over worker conditions on World Cup infrastructure \u2013 and in the UAE \u2013 over Abu Dhabi\u2019s Saadiyat Island and the 2020 World Expo in Dubai \u2013 has been mounting.   Until now the construction industry has managed to avoid being at the centre of reporting on this issue, but in the past few weeks there have been signs that this is changing, with allegations of mistreatment by migrant workers connected to multinational firms running large-scale projects in the region. Is the construction sector ready for this closer scrutiny? An analysis of the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre\u2019s outreach work to construction companies across the Gulf strongly suggests that they are not. The outreach programme was designed to try to understand what action companies are taking to protect vulnerable migrant workers. The centre reaches out to businesses in different sectors to spotlight emerging or urgent issues where workers or communities are at risk from business activities and find out what action companies are taking to mitigate their impacts, for example Syrian refugees in Turkish garment factories and foreign investments in Myanmar. We frequently ask companies to respond to specific allegations of human rights abuse. Normally, we get a response from about 75% of companies. In contrast, our construction outreach saw a 24% response rate \u2013 our lowest feedback for a survey so far. Of the 53 companies we have contacted regarding working conditions for migrant workers, only 12 have submitted completed questionnaires. Nine declined to respond. For us, this highlights a worrying reluctance in the construction industry to engage on human rights. This is particularly concerning because the construction labour pool in the region is made up almost entirely of migrant workers. Companies who responded have taken a significant positive step for transparency and accountability on migrant worker welfare, but it means that the majority of companies have effectively fallen at the first hurdle, not even disclosing what measures they have in place to meet local labour laws.  This is despite a growing expectation from governments for companies to demonstrate the steps they are taking to eradicate modern slavery from their operations and supply chains, brought by legislation such as the UK Modern Slavery Act. This week\u2019s UN Asia regional forum on business and human rights in Doha will include sessions on the importance of human rights reporting and company disclosure.  One reason for the silence from some in the construction industry might be that sub-contracting chains involved in large development projects are lengthy and complex. Between the main contractor and the worker on the site there are project owners and developers, project managers, consultants, joint ventures, sub-contractors, facilities managers, manpower firms and recruitment agencies.  This enables companies to pass the buck when it comes to the rights of migrant workers. This attitude shone through in the feedback we received \u2013 a UAE-headquartered developer declined to respond to us because they \u201cdo not deal in construction\u201d. Even in the case of companies with direct responsibility for workers, a culture of non-disclosure exists, with companies citing contractual confidentiality or internal policies that prevent them from divulging information on their projects. Despite the growing indignation surrounding the lack of real action to deal with the abuses faced by migrant workers at the bottom of the recruitment chain, there persists a blind belief in many boardrooms of large construction firms that a policy commitment, or only using approved recruitment providers, or contractually obliging business partners to respect labour rights, is enough to ensure abuses don\u2019t occur. There is still little proactive monitoring done to ensure that these measures translate to action.  Regardless of the difficulties and cost involved, not undertaking basic due diligence to protect migrant workers in business relationships is unacceptable. There needs to be a recognition that accountability for the welfare of labourers extends beyond main contractors to all those profiting from a construction project.  The handful of companies who have taken the lead in publicly committing to and upholding migrant workers\u2019 rights stand in good stead as countries introduce mandatory human rights reporting and assign projects to companies based on their human rights performance. Scrutiny of the construction industry in the Gulf is only going to increase, and it\u2019s in companies\u2019 interests to start talking or face the reputational and legal consequences.

Eleanor Sharpston QC, who is an advocate-general at the Luxembourg court as well as a karate black-belt and square-rigger sailor, has expressed disappointment that legal cooperation might end as a result of a Brexit vote. In an interview at the European court of justice (ECJ), Sharpston also delivered a caution over the powers of national constitutional courts and denied that European judges delivered the final verdict in cases. The ECJ\u2019s expanding role has become increasingly contentious during the referendum campaign. Founded in 1952 as what was then the court of justice of the European coal and steel communities, the court is less well known than the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Luxembourg\u2019s decisions, however, are binding on all courts throughout the EU, unlike those from the ECHR, which, technically, only have to be \u201ctaken into account\u201d. The ECJ\u2019s enlarged jurisdiction, caseload and ultimate authority have therefore ensured it receives regular blasts of Eurosceptic invective. Claims that the court threatens the UK\u2019s sovereignty eventually capsized attempts to haul Boris Johnson aboard the remain campaign. His wife, Marina Wheeler QC, had written an influential article in February criticising the \u201cjurisdictional muscle-flexing of the court in Luxembourg\u201d since the EU\u2019s charter of fundamental rights came into force in 2009. The court, she added, acts \u201ccapriciously not judiciously\u201d.   Related: European court to consider legality of UK surveillance laws    Standing on a plateau above the city of Luxembourg in the Quartier Europ\u00e9en, the ECJ is a concentric series of modernist buildings that have grown outwards as the court\u2019s work increased.  More than 2,000 people \u2013 half of them translators \u2013 work in a complex that is redolent of an art gallery, with spacious corridors, decorated walls and processional stairways. The court\u2019s reception is staffed by smart G4S attendants, in black suits, white lanyards and ties. A third high-rise bronze and glass tower is under construction. From the top, four countries are visible \u2013 Luxembourg, France, Germany and Belgium.  The grand salle, the ECJ\u2019s largest courtroom, can seat 300 people; 15 judges in their claret red robes and an advocate-general sit on a semi-circular bench beneath a pendulous mesh curtain that diffuses light. Some lawyers disparage it as a touch of \u201cDubai\u201d; others look up and imagine a billowing mushroom. The court\u2019s walls are painted gold; the floor is richly coloured Californian redwood. Sharpston, 60, who is a fellow of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, and a former joint head of chambers in London, has an office overlooking Luxembourg City. She has been at the ECJ since 2006 \u2013 the longest serving UK member of the court\u2019s judiciary.  \u201cThe UK has made a very strong contribution to this court and the evolution of EU law since it joined in terms of injecting a degree of pragmatism,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe procedures of this court and the way it deals with cases have been improved by the addition of the [British] common law tradition into the mix. \u201cSome very good [UK] people have served in the court \u2013 Lord Gordon Slynn, Sir Konrad Schiemann [both appeal court judges] and Sir Francis Jacobs \u2013 and they have made a difference. \u201cIt would be a pity to lose this contribution ... The quality of what is done within EU law is enriched by having a strong contribution by good common law [practitioners] coming from the UK and Ireland.\u201d Only after the UK joined the common market in 1973 did judges begin to ask questions during hearings; the dominant French tradition had been simply to sit back and listen.  Sharpston agrees that the ECJ has become more prominent, citing increases in the number of EU states and type of issues handled. Last year, the ECJ dealt with more than 700 cases for the first time.  \u201cVarious things are happening simultaneously,\u201d she explained. \u201cOver the years other competences have come within the field of EU law \u2026 by common agreement of EU states. It\u2019s not that the EU grabbed new powers\u2026  \u201c[Now] we get cases which are about immigration, asylum and European arrest warrants \u2026 All of this is much closer to the core business of [the ECHR in] Strasbourg. EU law is engaged in a wider range of topics now because that\u2019s what member states wanted. There are more cases where there may be fundamental rights aspects.\u201d It is this expansion that frightens Eurosceptics. Johnson has promoted a sovereignty bill that envisages the UK\u2019s supreme court taking on an enhanced status similar to Germany\u2019s constitutional court, thereby, it has been claimed, allowing British judges to resist Luxembourg\u2019s rulings.  Sharpston does not believe constitutional courts disrupt the relationship between EU and national courts. \u201cWe are perfectly aware that the judges of the German constitutional court have their judicial oath,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cause us trouble. They are not trigger happy with it. It\u2019s not a general enabling power to disapply [ECJ judgments] they don\u2019t like. It\u2019s a very specific protection and they operate it as that.\u201d She also points out that the ECJ deals with requests from national courts for clarification of legal principles. \u201cWe don\u2019t decide national cases,\u201d she said. \u201cThe national judges handle it. We answer the questions. We don\u2019t decide the case.\u201d There is regular, behind-the-scenes dialogue between ECJ and national judges. Last Monday (11 April), the day before the ECJ heard a case about the legality of the UK\u2019s surveillance legislation, the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger, and other senior British judges were in Luxembourg for legal discussions.  Plans to make the ECJ more accessible to the estimated 500 million people who fall within its jurisdiction, by providing live online broadcasts of proceedings, are under discussion. Difficulties in providing simultaneous translations, however, may delay this plan. ECJ judges are paid \u20ac240,000 (\u00a3191,000) a year, which is slightly less than a UK appeal court judge. Sharpston has a more specialised role as an advocate-general, providing an initial, guiding opinion ahead of the final judgment. Such opinions are, in the vast majority of cases, followed by the court as a whole. She characterises her job as being like a scout ahead of an army. She bats criticism of the ECJ\u2019s main courtroom as ostentatious away by drawing a comparison to the Gothic architectural extravagances of the royal courts of justice in London.  Sharpston is used to strong headwinds: proudly framed on one of her office shelves are the shredded remains of a topsail blowout in a mid-Atlantic storm.  Her name has been mentioned as a possible future member of the UK\u2019s supreme court. \u201cI\u2019m watching with interest what happens in the next few months,\u201d she said.

Photograph: Holger Burmeister/Alamy    The privately owned chain, which started as a single shop in Victoria in London, opened 36 new branches worldwide last year, taking the total to 399, and made more additions this year such as a shop in Dubai international airport. Schlee said sales had also been helped by good customer service, fostered by taking care of staff. \u201cOne of our core values is happy teams mean happy customers,\u201d said Schlee. He added that Pret had raised wages to maintain the business\u2019s differential above the \u201cnational living wage\u201d for over-25s introduced by the government this month. Staff earn \u00a37.50 an hour in London and can earn a \u00a31 an hour bonus if they meet customer service criteria checked by mystery shoppers. Workers who put in a full day\u2019s shift also get two free meals. Schlee said the package was helping Pret stand out from rivals such as Caffe Nero and Eat, both of which have recently been criticised for cutting back on staff benefits. \u201cWe are now finding it easier to recruit people,\u201d he said. Pret expects to open 10 more US stores this year, including a second outlet at Penn station. The chain\u2019s newly opened first store at the busy New York hub has the highest sales a square foot of any Pret in the world. The group also opened sites at Paris-Gare de Lyon as well as Nice airport. Up to six more outlets are to open in France and three more in Hong Kong. The majority of Pret\u2019s 303 UK stores are in London. The company expects to open about 30 stores in the UK this year, up from 23 last year, 12 of which were outside London.

The upmarket estate agent Knight Frank said the cost of renting in office towers such as the Shard, Walkie Talkie and Cheesegrater rose 9.7% to $126 (\u00a387.50) per square foot in the second half of 2015 from the previous six months and by 21.4% from a year earlier. The 21-city skyscraper index compared the rental performance of commercial buildings of more than 30 storeys across the world against the first half of 2015. The UK capital also topped the table between January and June 2015, with an 11% rise in rents. London rents rose twice as fast as those in San Francisco, at 4.76%, and three times quicker than in Hong Kong and Mumbai, where rents went up by 3%.   Skyscraper rents in pounds   Will Beardmore-Gray, Knight Frank\u2019s head of tenant representation and agency business, said rents in London were likely to head higher still due to \u201chuge demand for space in landmark, tall buildings\u201d.  He said London had not provided the tower space international companies were looking for until recently. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more tower buildings in central London that you could put in any capital and be proud of.\u201d James Roberts, the chief economist at Knight Frank, said: \u201cLondon has held up relatively well through what was a slow patch for the global economy over the last year.\u201d He added that supply in the City office market was at its lowest since mid-2001.  London was likely to be top of the rental growth table again this year, he said, barring a vote to leave the EU in the June referendum, which could lead to the market stalling.  Roberts explained that firms that have been reluctant to relocate because of economic uncertainty would have to move to more modern premises at some point and that the \u201ciconic architecture\u201d of the new skyscrapers was a draw. \u201cThe buildings haven\u2019t been boring boxes,\u201d he said. Tenants in the Walkie Talkie and Cheesegrater, both relatively recent additions to the London skyline, paid the highest rents in the capital last year. They are in the EC3 post code, dominated by the insurance industry, which has fared much better than the banking sector in recent years.       The towers are set to be overshadowed by 22 Bishopsgate \u2013 the reworked Pinnacle \u2013 which will be the largest office building built in London, after the City of London corporation backed its developers in a battle over the \u201cright to light\u201d with neighbouring buildings. The next skyscraper in the City, expected to be finished in late 2018, will be Brookfield\u2019s 100 Bishopsgate. There are 436 buildings above 20 storeys in the pipeline across London. The high-rise boom has provoked controversy over its impact on the skyline, while residents and businesses are concerned about wind tunnels and a lack of light. Until about 10 years ago, there were few skyscrapers in London. Between the NatWest tower in 1979 and the Gherkin in 2003, not a single one was built in the City. Bruce Dear, the head of London real estate at Eversheds, said: \u201cThere is a floating city above London in the Canary Wharf and City tower clusters. Space in these towers is scarce and high status, like high-rise white truffles. So the towers rental market obeys different laws to the rents of ground dwellers. Ultimately, scarcity is allowing these towers to defy the slowing global economy.\u201d   Related: How much does it cost to rent in the UK? Share your experiences    The skyscraper index shows that Hong Kong remains the most expensive place to rent in the world \u2013 the average rent is more than twice as high as in London, at $263.25 per sq ft per year. New York remains in second place at $155, followed by Tokyo at $128.75 and London at $126.  Singapore was the only city where rents saw a significant decline in the second half of 2015. The 4.75% drop was caused by oversupply of office space and a drop in business confidence as a result of the slowdown in the Chinese economy. In Beijing, skyscraper rents dropped by 0.71% to $62.75 per sq ft. Frankfurt posted a decline of 1.16%, to $51.75 per sq ft. Paris was flat at $55.75, while skyscraper rents in Toronto, Dubai and Madrid were also unchanged.  In the US, the booming technology sector has underpinned rental growth for towers in cities like San Francisco and Boston.

Allegations of alleged bribery linked to Leighton\u2019s overseas operations first surfaced in 2012, with several former executives resigning in response.

The evidence comes after Fairfax Media reported it had been given a compulsory order from Asic to hand over files belonging to corrupt Monaco-based firm Unaoil as part of Asic\u2019s investigation into Gregg. The files reveal millions of dollars of offshore payments by Australian companies, including Leighton Holdings.

With no one able to offer a viable solution, Nadal has been unable to shake the short tugging addiction that has made his pre-serve routine one of the stranger sights on the men\u2019s tour and, indeed, helping him to unsettle and fluster his opponents by keeping them waiting for as long as possible up the other end of the court.

Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images    \u201cWhen you do senseless things over and over, you\u2019re superstitious. He has told me before he can stop doing them and I have told him to do it. I like things that are logical. It does not affect his game, but if he needed those things to play well, it would be bad.\u201d Few players bring as much superstition to the court as Nadal, whose quirks range from jumping while at the net during the coin toss and going to the towel after every point to running to the baseline before knocking up and crossing the line only with his right foot.  But there are ways to get inside his head. After following a swig from his recovery drink with a sip of water \u2013 always in that order \u2013 Nadal is meticulous in the placement of both bottles near his chair, which is why Lukas Rosol knew exactly what he was doing when he knocked one over with his racket during their match at Wimbledon in 2014. Not that it did Rosol much good. Nadal still romped to victory. JS 2) The Junaid Jump There are many bowlers with quirks at the start of their run-up \u2013 like Morne Morkel, whose run-up essentially begins with him facing in the wrong direction, from where he spins and sets off. Other run-ups have unusual ends, like the former West Indies quick Colin Croft, who would run in a straight line towards the stumps, almost hiding from the batsman\u2019s view behind the umpire, before leaping suddenly to one side just before he released the ball. \u201cNobody taught me how to bowl,\u201d he said. \u201cI bowled because I was comfortable and confident and at ease and natural. It must have given me an advantage \u2013 it gave me 125 wickets in 27 Tests.\u201d  It is rare, however, to have weird anomalies in the middle. There\u2019s the Harbhajan Singh spreadeagle, of course, which involves the spinner decorating his short run-up by momentarily stretching his arms wide as if considering flight, before tucking them in again and delivering the ball, but none could be more remarkable than the Junaid Jump, as practised by the 26-year-old Pakistan bowler Junaid Khan. About a quarter of the way through his run-up Junaid would leap in the air like a spring lamb, before carrying on as if nothing had happened, picking up pace on his way to the wicket. \u201cI feel it gives me momentum,\u201d he told PakPassion.net. \u201cIt\u2019s like a car changing gear, I feel I am changing gear in my run-up after the jump. I start my run-up slowly, then change gear after my jump.\u201d   Related: The Joy of Six: drops in sport | Tom Bryant    In another interview he explained the genesis of the jump, which he first introduced while playing for Water and Power Development Agency against Fort Qasim in a Pakistani domestic game. \u201cIt was a flat wicket and Khalid Latif and Umar Amin were batting on and on,\u201d he said. \u201cWith no clear idea, I just took a jump before the run up, hoping to psyche out the batsman, and it so happened that I got him out that very ball. It was an excellent delivery. Then the same thing happened in another game. So it became part of my run-up, to a point where it felt like without the jump I wasn\u2019t bowling as well.\u201d While audiences thrilled to Junaid\u2019s idiosyncrasy, it didn\u2019t exactly please the game\u2019s classicists, or for that matter the player\u2019s coaches. \u201cWhen I try to stop doing the jump, I feel I can\u2019t even bowl properly,\u201d he said. \u201cMy run-up and rhythm are all over the place without it. Some senior players told me to jump, others said don\u2019t jump. Some senior players advised me that we play most of our games in the UAE where the ground is softer because of the sand, and so the jump puts more strain on you, there\u2019s more of a risk of injury. Mohammad Akram [then coach of the Pakistan National Cricket Academy] said to me that if the jump helps with the rhythm, then I should continue jumping.\u201d The doom-mongers, it turned out, had a point. In October 2014 he twisted his knee, and soon afterwards suffered a grade three osteochondral fracture, also to his knee. He was out for nearly eight months, and by the time he came back the jump was gone. \u201cI had to stop because we play a lot of games here in Dubai and Sharjah where the ground is very soft,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the body weight concentrated on the legs during the jump, the risk of injury increases. So, it just had to go.\u201d Some of Junaid\u2019s mojo seems to have gone with it. In 18 Tests before his injury he took 65 wickets at an average of 28.83; in four Tests since he has taken six wickets at an average of 63.16. He has not played for his country in any format since last June, and it looks increasingly like \u2013 even if he is selected in the touring party \u2013 the Junaid Jump will be sadly absent from Pakistan\u2019s tour of England this summer.

The third is: people will claim that beer helps. The fourth is: miss that penalty and you\u2019ll feel like a pillock. It\u2019s a harsh sport, all right, and kickers know that better than most. Because in addition to physical pain, they are exposed to a level of spiritual torment that drives some of them to self-flagellation or, at least, to ghastly uncomfortable pre-kick rituals. We\u2019re not talking Owen Farrell\u2019s laser-eye routine here, nor even Dan Biggar\u2019s fidgety jig, we mean the deliberate adoption of a stance so awkward that onlookers are not sure whether the kicker is bravely shattering convention in the pursuit of perfection or is simply inviting ridicule as a way of steeling himself for the abuse he\u2019ll get if he misses.  Jonny Wilkinson introduced us to the sight of a man preparing for a kick in the same way he might prepare for an on-toilet prayer, crouching down and clasping his hands in front of his chest as he aimed for heaven. And Gloucester\u2019s Rob Cook, alone in the world, reckoned that stance was not quite awkward enough. He figured the crouching was good but the arms should be outstretched in the manner of Superman in full-flight \u2013 and the legs should not be together but splayed as wide as possible as if attempting to straddle two horses at once. And the weirdest thing is it works: the joy of landing a kick successfully is augmented by the pleasure of silencing all the cat-callers and wolf-whistlers. Until the next time.

But Marion Bartoli was different. Tennis players practise for hours, going through the same drills, straining to perfect the same shots, looking to hit the same sweet spots with unrelenting accuracy, and the countless hours spent honing their games mean they go into matches knowing nothing has been left to chance. Some of them reckon, for instance, that the brief knock-up with their opponent before the umpire calls time is a pointless waste of energy. A person can only do so much revision. Yet Bartoli was different. In the moments before her opponent\u2019s serve, she would take the opportunity to go through the tennis equivalent of shadow boxing, bouncing around the court and swinging through a number of imaginary balls. It is what part of what made the enigmatic Frenchwoman so interesting to watch. When she served, she bounced the ball at a level that would shame Lisa Simpson and her swing was so exaggerated it looked like she was playing it for laughs. Yet after years of falling short, Bartoli won her first grand slam at the age of 28, beating an emotional Sabine Lisicki in the Wimbledon final in 2013. Practice makes perfect.

Barry\u2019s free throws were unusual, in that he used the outdated and wildly unfashionable underhand throwing technique, sometimes referred to as \u201cgranny-style\u201d, which Wilt Chamberlain, a notoriously unreliable free throw exponent, tried and abandoned \u2013 despite its positive effect on his averages \u2013 on the grounds that it made him \u201cfeel silly, like a sissy\u201d. \u201cI like to bounce the ball three times,\u201d Barry explains in the video. Why three, he is asked? \u201cWell, I just got in the habit of doing it three times, and I just do it the same way.\u201d  With the free throw, everyone\u2019s got a habit, a ritual that probably falls somewhere between a conscious tic and a superstition. Some are just more unusual than others, and Karl Malone\u2019s perhaps the most unusual of all, as he bounced the ball a few times, tossed is in the air twice, and then spent a few seconds mumbling unintelligibly. A lip-reader at one point announced that he was saying, \u201cthis is for Karl, Karl, my baby boy\u201d, which may sound like a strange way for a man to refer to himself, but Malone does indeed have a son with the same name as himself \u2013 as well as three daughters, Kadee, Kylee and Karlee \u2013 though the player insisted he would say different things on different occasions. Whatever he said, it worked \u2013 before he discovered mumbling he converted an underwhelming 54.8% of his free throws, afterwards it rocketed to 75.7%, and he made more free throws than anyone else in NBA history (albeit having attempted more than 2,000 more than his nearest rival). SB     If you listen very carefully you might be able to hear the Karl Malone mumble.

There are others who do it as a code, a sign as to the play they\u2019re about to run \u2013 similarly, in baseball, a pitcher might alert his catcher as to what he\u2019s about to throw with a couple of quick licks. But then there\u2019s the New Orleans Saints\u2019 Drew Brees, a man who more or less dines out on his digits several hundred times a game. Lick, lick, lick, throw. Lick, lick. Lick. Throw. Lick, lick, lick. It\u2019s not just when he\u2019s on the field. Last September the Saints played without the injured Brees for the first time in virtually a decade, leaving the quarterback to follow the match from the sideline. Every time the huddle broke, Brees would rub his hands, clap them, then lick his hands just the same as if he was actually in the game. With finger licking that good, surely it is only a matter of time before Kentucky Fried Chicken comes calling.

In a song lasting a mere two minutes and five seconds, they captured a universe. William Finnegan makes the same story last through 447 pages, but Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life is much more than the description of one foaming wall of water after another. Although the author does, indeed, take the reader out with him time after time towards the wave-sets that roll endlessly towards the surfing beaches where he has spent a fair proportion of his 64 years, he makes good on the implicit promise that each ride will offer a different experience.     William Finnegan Photograph: EPA    Finnegan certainly captured the interest and admiration of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize judges, who this week gave him their award for the year\u2019s best biography or autobiography. This honour is not frequently bestowed on books about surfing. But then this is no ordinary surfing writer. As a reporter for the New Yorker, Finnegan has spent many years specialising in conflict. Towards the end of the narrative, when his professional career is reaching maturity, he mentions reporting from the wars in El Salvador, Mozambique, the Balkans and South Sudan. The reader is left with the impression there have been plenty more. When he pulls back from the war zones, he writes about poachers of endangered tortoises in Madagascar, Uzbek people-traffickers in Dubai and the victims of police torture in Tijuana. In all of this \u2013 as when he returns to the Los Angeles of his adolescence and discovers a community \u201cspiritually poisoned\u201d by progress \u2013 surfing provides him with an infallible reconnection to a different plane of existence. \u201cI slipped away from my family at an early age,\u201d Finnegan writes, \u201cand surfing was my escape route.\u201d Helpfully, the family from which he was slipping away had homes first in Los Angeles and then in Hawaii. As escape routes go, this one had unusually clear signposts, and there was a succession of surf buddies to accompany him.   Related: William Finnegan: 'I was reluctant to come out of the closet as a surfer'    \u201cSurfing is a secret garden, not easily entered,\u201d he continues, and part of the book\u2019s appeal is the tension between the writer\u2019s desire to describe and share and the wave-rider\u2019s instinct to keep the whole thing a secret. There is dismay when a favourite hidden beach in Fiji is opened up to tourists, with a helicopter pad where fisherman had once stacked dry wood for signal fires. \u201cSurfers,\u201d he claims, \u201chope bleakly that surfing will one day become, like rollerblading, uncool.\u201d That is unlikely to happen as long as there are writers as talented as Finnegan to translate the experience for readers who will never know at first hand the sensation of riding a 7ft single-fin board flat-out through the barrel, of watching from the inside as a wave collapses like a falling chandelier, of surfing on LSD or of being ground into the sea bed by a two-wave hold-down. (A what? You\u2019ll find out.) People who write about surfing often get metaphysical to a degree that irritates and ultimately excludes the uninitiated. But throughout Finnegan\u2019s life, the pastime appears to have provided a strand of meaning \u2013 sometimes the primary one. His success is to convince us of the authenticity of that meaning, and not just when he is engaged on a magnificently eventful round-the-world journey that occupies him between the ages of 26 and 30 and encompasses surfing locations both obvious and obscure, including the then-undiscovered Thai island of Ko Samui, more recently the playground of Premier League stars. \u201cSurfers have a perfection fetish,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe perfect wave, etcetera. There is no such thing. Waves are not stationary objects in nature like roses or diamonds. They\u2019re quick, violent events at the end of a long chain of storm action and ocean reaction. Even the most symmetrical breaks have quirks and a totally specific, local character, changing with every shift in tide and wind and swell. The best days at the best breaks have a Platonic aspect \u2013 they begin to embody a model of what surfers want waves to be. But that\u2019s the end of it, that beginning.\u201d Any discussion of surfing is riddled with jargon, and Finnegan does not avoid it. He leaves us to fend for ourselves and we grow used to the mention of beachbreaks and pointbreaks and shorebreaks, of squashtail boards and long-radius speed pumps. But the writing, especially in the first half of the book, is of such high quality \u2013 often making me think of the terse but elegant sentences of James Salter \u2013 that the ignoramus is happy to go along for the ride. But for those of us who entertain the obvious Beach Boys-fed yearnings but can barely swim the width of a pool, Finnegan occasionally comes up, albeit somewhat grudgingly, with an explanation. He also provides a large quantity of fascinating background information. Summer, for instance, is not the preferred season for serious surfers. It may be good for bleaching your hair and topping up your tan, but the real practitioners go looking for the roiling effect of winter storms.   Related: The holy trinity of surfing: wave, board and rider \u2013\u00a0in pictures    The wind you want is not the one that comes from the ocean but the one that comes from the land, to hold up and shape the waves as they unfurl towards the shore. And the virtue a surfer needs most is patience. The mystical aspects are touched on lightly: \u201cAmong my friends, there is a strong belief in the surfer\u2019s path. Most people swerved from it sooner or later.\u201d He veered away himself, when life and work took him to \u201cwaveless places \u2013 Montana, London, New York\u201d. But he came back to it and convinces even the most landlocked of his readers that we\u2019ve been missing something. \u201cBeing out in big surf is dreamlike,\u201d he writes. \u201cTerror and ecstasy ebb and flow around the edges of things, each threatening to overwhelm the dreamer. An unearthly beauty saturates an enormous arena of moving water, latent violence, too-real explosions, and sky. Scenes feel mythic even as they unfold. I always feel a ferocious ambivalence: I want to be nowhere else, I want to be anywhere else.\u201d A secret garden, maybe. But one that, thanks to Barbarian Days, is open to visitors. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember the wipeout \u2013 all I remembered was the rapture,\u201d he says of an early experience, and we seem to remember it, too.

If you are in London, you could stroll from Westminster to Tower Bridge and see a sequence of short films produced by Shakespeare\u2019s Globe. Alternatively you could pop into a fascinating exhibition at the British Library titled Shakespeare in Ten Acts. To confirm Shakespeare\u2019s global reach, in Dubai you could catch an immersive Romeo and Juliet staged in a vast shopping mall, and in Warsaw there\u2019s a season of Shakespeare-inspired ballets with Polish dancers and Iranian designers. This bombardment of Bardolatry prompts a series of questions. What is it about Shakespeare\u2019s plays that keeps them so constantly performed and studied at a time when the idea of a western canon is in question? Is the hierarchical status given to Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies due for urgent reassessment? And how should we stage his plays in a period of rapid social change and shifting theatrical techniques? Aside from the obvious richness of plot, language and character, two things especially strike me. One is that Shakespeare, like his contemporary Cervantes in Don Quixote, displays a pioneering freedom that anticipates many of the developments of his chosen form. Just as Cervantes gives us magic realism and a self-referential narrative avant la lettre, so Shakespeare plays with time, space, direct address, inner consciousness, cosmic despair and metaphysical absurdity in ways that prefigure future drama. When Peter Brook directed King Lear in 1962, critics commented on the Beckettian nature of the moment when Alan Webb\u2019s blinded Gloucester fell to the ground believing he was hurling himself off a Dover cliff. Brook wasn\u2019t, however, imposing Beckett on Shakespeare: the great modernist was always present in his predecessor.     \u2018Tragic solitude\u2019 \u2026 Emily Plumtree as Nerissa and Susannah Fielding as Portia in the Almeida theatre\u2019s Las Vegas-set Merchant of Venice. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian     Related: What\u2019s in a number? William Shakespeare\u2019s legacy analysed    A second key Shakespeare quality is an ambivalence that allows his plays to change their meaning according to when and where they are produced. Hamlet is the most famous example. As Oscar Wilde remarked, there is no such thing as Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet: the role is defined by the temperament of the leading actor. The play also changes according to historical and geographical circumstance. The western tradition is, by and large, to see it as a study of existential doubt. In contrast, at the Taganka Theatre in Moscow in the Soviet era, it became a portrait of obsessive state surveillance with characters constantly observed from behind a vast mobile curtain. As staged by the Bulandra Theatre in Bucharest during the Ceausescu years, Elsinore was transformed into a decaying museum that became a symbol of a declining Romania. Shakespeare\u2019s infinite adaptability is the source of his global popularity. In 1992 I gave a talk to a Shakespeare conference in Adelaide mischievously titled Was Shakespeare English? I heard recently that this is also the title of a forthcoming documentary which argues that Shakespeare\u2019s Italy-based comedies could only have been written by a native Italian. I wasn\u2019t, however, questioning the veracity of Shakespeare\u2019s origins. My point was that Shakespeare was too elusive, variable and pluralistic to be the exclusive property of one culture. It\u2019s a point that has been richly confirmed by international seasons at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe and the RSC. Even in English, the plays are brilliantly unstable. The great South African actor John Kani once told me a story about playing Othello at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. To local liberals, the play was a tragedy about the hero\u2019s destructive credulity. To the weekend township audience, claimed Kani, the play suddenly became a topical drama about the eternal fraudulence of the white liar.   Related: Shakespeare: who put those thoughts in his head?    The examples I\u2019ve quoted have all been from Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies and they retain their popular currency. This year you can hardly move without stumbling across King Lear. Don Warrington in Manchester and Michael Pennington in Northampton are currently playing the king. Later we will see Antony Sher in Stratford and Glenda Jackson at the Old Vic crazily dividing their kingdoms. Among the comedies, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is also a perennial favourite. Erica Whyman\u2019s RSC production, billed as \u201ca play for the nation\u201d, is now traversing the land, and Emma Rice shortly opens her reign at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe with a radical new version. I relish Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies and comedies. But I question the inherited assumption that they represent Shakespeare\u2019s supreme achievement and speak to us most clearly today. Peter Brook once wrote that Shakespeare\u2019s plays are like planets which move closer to or further away from Earth at moments in their orbit: he cited Timon of Athens, which, in its bitterness and cynicism, seems peculiarly modern. My own claim would be that it is Shakespeare\u2019s histories which today seem more urgently apprehensible than even Lear or Othello.  It\u2019s a big assertion but one that is backed up by current performance schedules. The RSC is halfway through an epic history cycle. The BBC is about to unveil the second part of its Hollow Crown sequence, comprising the three parts of Henry VI and Richard III and starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Judi Dench, Sophie Okonedo and Michael Gambon. This weekend, Ivo van Hove brings his acclaimed Kings of War, placing Shakespeare\u2019s histories in the war rooms of modern political leaders, from Amsterdam to the Barbican. In late May I will set out eagerly for America to see the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre\u2019s version of the histories, in which director Barbara Gaines promises to view the cycle from the perspective of the common man. Last year I saw Galway\u2019s Druid Theatre Company offer a radical take on the plays in which both Henry IV and Henry V were played by women.     \u2018Popular currency\u2019 \u2026 Don Warrington as King Lear with Pepter Lunkuse at the Royal Exchange. Photograph: Jonathan Keenan     Related: Shakespeare's last act: a torrent of twisted fantasies    So why is it that Shakespeare\u2019s histories speak to us so clearly today? One reason is that the plays are not, as often thought, simple exercises in Tudor propaganda, but penetrating studies of politics and power. James Shapiro\u2019s book, 1599, reminds us just how subversive Shakespeare\u2019s Richard II was in the age of Elizabeth I: as Shapiro writes, the authorities were concerned that Londoners might draw lessons from a story about \u201cthe overthrow of a childless monarch who had taxed them ruthlessly and mismanaged Ireland\u201d. Today the play has lost none of its potency since it poses a perennially topical question: at which point does it become legitimate to unseat a leader who claims unquestioned authority whether it be divine, as in Richard\u2019s age, or democratic, as in our own? I don\u2019t imagine, for instance, that Dilma Rousseff would be keen to see the play revived in modern Rio. But all Shakespeare\u2019s history plays deal with ever-pertinent issues. Henry V never ceases to astonish me with its capacity to reflect the mood of the moment. Laurence Olivier\u2019s 1944 movie was sanctioned as a morale-booster by politicians and dedicated to the fighting men liberating Europe at the close of the second world war. And in 2003, at the time of the Iraq war, Nicholas Hytner chose the play to begin his tenure at the National Theatre and showed Adrian Lester\u2019s king launching a foreign invasion on questionable legal grounds and making chauvinist speeches to TV cameras and embedded journalists. The Polish academic Jan Kott once wrote a book called Shakespeare: Our Contemporary. If Kott\u2019s claim is still true, it is because it is repeatedly endorsed by Shakespeare\u2019s histories. This, however, raises the question of how we stage Shakespeare\u2019s plays today. Do we heighten their application to the present? Or do we leave it to audiences to deduce the contemporary parallels? I don\u2019t believe there is a fixed solution. Everything hinges on the integrity of the approach and the insights it provides.     \u2018Ambivalence\u2019 \u2026 Maxine Peake as Hamlet at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange in 2014. Photograph: Jonathan Keenan    I would cite the case of Rupert Goold. When he set The Merchant of Venice, first for the RSC and later at the Almeida, in modern Las Vegas, he brought out brilliantly the gambling culture that pervades the play and highlighted the tragic solitude of Portia who ended up as a wealthy heiress belatedly realising she was tied to a husband whose sexual preferences lay elsewhere. But I was less struck by a Goold Hamlet set among 1940s Parisian existentialists: a bright idea that was not fortified by the text. What is clear is that our approach to casting is changing rapidly, and has to go much further, in matters of race and gender. David Oyelowo has played Henry VI, Adrian Lester Hamlet and Henry V, Paapa Essiedu is the new, very good, Stratford Hamlet. But this is the first stage in reclaiming Shakespeare for black and Asian actors. I can\u2019t think of a single Shakespeare play that wouldn\u2019t be reinvigorated by this process. And, although it may annoy some, I long for the day when a white actor can once more play Othello. If Jonas Kaufmann is permitted to sing Verdi\u2019s Otello at Covent Garden, why can\u2019t a white actor, without the obscene literalism of \u201cblacking up\u201d, play the Moor?   Related: Bed tricks and broken women: Shakespeare's guide to love    Gender-blind casting is also refreshing and right. Acting is a feat of imaginative impersonation: a point made by Harriet Walter in an interview in the British Library Exhibition, where she says she has just as much, or just as little, in common with Brutus as she has with Cleopatra. I take that to mean that it requires the same feat of transubstantiation to turn herself into an anguished Roman senator as it does into an omnipotent Egyptian queen. My only observation is that mixed-gender casting works just as well, if not better, than single-sex productions. When Maxine Peake played Hamlet in Manchester, it made total sense for her to have a male Claudius and a female Polonius. Similarly, in the current Stratford Hamlet, it is intriguing to see a male Rosencrantz and a female Guildenstern. In gender, as with race, the only true test lies in the quality of the actor. In the end, Shakespeare\u2019s plays will always be a mirror for the times. But, while I applaud the cyclical re-invention of Shakespeare, I also believe that should not preclude a microscopic attention to the text. If I have any fear, it is that more attention is sometimes paid to ostentatious design than to the excavation of meaning. For me, a great Shakespeare production is one where I emerge with a new understanding of the play achieved through acting and direction. If we are to make the festivities surrounding Shakespeare\u2019s 400th anniversary something more than a ritual gesture, it will be through a renewed focus on his language.

It is a point that might equally have applied down the years to anyone wanting to own an English football club. As high-risk commercial ambitions go this one has never really made much sense. Outside the real elite, football clubs are still right up there with airlines or a particularly decadent 1970s record label when it comes to mechanisms for losing lots of money very quickly. The puzzle remains. Why would any non-mad, non-corrupt business person actually want to do this? It is a question that might seem particularly poignant to fans of Charlton Athletic and Aston Villa as the season thrashes towards its end point. Both clubs were relegated this week. Both are contorted by supporter unrest. Both face major losses. Both give the impression of having been hollowed out from the inside, one in a rush, one over time, by a new style of disastrous, long-range speculative ownership. Football never stands still. New forms, new tropes emerge. There have been shadier, more abusive owners than the wretched Roland Duch\u00e2telet and the decent but distant Randy Lerner. But the fact remains, even as Lerner creeps closer to finally selling Villa, that here English football has found a pair of owners who aren\u2019t just bad judged against the traditional sweaty incompetents, or the standards of some impossibly virtuous fan-collective ideal. But bad instead in new and innovative ways; bad in a way that frankly makes no real sense for anyone.   Related: Aston Villa\u2019s Randy Lerner says blame for relegation rests solely with him    Consider for a moment Duch\u00e2telet\u2019s progress at Charlton. Has there ever been a more chaotic, self-destructive two-year spell of ownership? It really shouldn\u2019t be that hard to make Charlton work, a homely old suburban club that was fanned into life by the late-Victorian spread of prosperity east along the railway lines, and which in the golden years either side of the second world war could draw the biggest crowds in the country. Hard times have come and gone. By the mid-1980s The Valley was a concrete ruin, with weeds blooming up between your feet through the cracks on the terraces. But jump to 2004 and Charlton were finishing seventh in the Premier League, hovering around the Champions League spots right up until the moment Chelsea decided to put a stop to all that by plucking out Scott Parker. Duch\u00e2telet bought the club in January 2014 through Staprix NV, \u201can investment vehicle with several football-related interests\u201d. An entrepreneur, populist politician and mild oddball, he owns a syndicate of smallish clubs across Europe. Clearly he made some kind of sense to Richard Murray, the club\u2019s longstanding chairman. At which point: enter sandman. In 28 months of Duch\u00e2telet-flavoured weirdness Charlton have burned through five managers. The current braying-donkey regime, with its cast of pressed men and passers-by has won 18 of 70 matches played. Last month Duch\u00e2telet released a statement defending the club\u2019s chief executive, Katrien Meire, who had compared the club\u2019s fans with cinema viewers and restaurant goers, who don\u2019t \u201cscream to the people in charge\u201d if they\u2019re unhappy with the customer service. The home defeat by Derby County last weekend brought huge protests outside the ground, with people dressed as Bedouin holding inflatable palm trees, a slightly confusing reference to the chief exec\u2019s recent 10-day holiday in Dubai. The Coalition Against Roland Duch\u00e2telet is planning another massive turnout around Saturday\u2019s home game against Brighton.     Charlton fans protest against Roland Duch\u00e2telet during a season of turmoil which is ending with relegation. Photograph: Martin Dalton/REX/Shutterstock    More than anything else, it is all bafflingly pointless, good news for nobody. Not least the owner who has scarcely been glimpsed on club property, and who has through a combination of basic mistakes \u2013 alienating supporters, enacting some half-baked inter-league player franchise plan \u2013 transformed a happy south London middleweight into a wild, miserable place desperate to free itself from the grip of a semi-detached speculator. Which brings us back to Lerner, an equally confusing if much more sympathetic figure. Lerner\u2019s real failing appears to be naivety. He got into this for the right reason. He backed his managers, in the early years at least. And yet he remains arguably the least successful owner in Premier League history. Lerner bought Villa with his own money. Ten years down the line the club has cost him \u00a3350m, in return for which he\u2019s been relegated, seen his fortune drained and generally been portrayed as a mysterious, sulky overseas refusenik. And so here we are: job losses, a crippling Championship wage bill, a club captain who raises the question of what exactly a footballer has to do to get sacked around here. Someone\u2019s not really been paying attention here, have they Randy old boy? Lerner is not a bad man. Personally I hope he gets a good price for the club, moves on, salvages some happy memories and never goes near a sports \u201cfranchise\u201d again. He is simply bad at being a tycoon, and bad at running Aston Villa. This is the real nub. You get the owners you deserve. As a society we have made the decision to submit to the market, to say that pretty much anyone can own pretty much anything, the only regulating forces being demand, supply and finance. This argument says that football clubs are not in any real sense community assets (communities themselves are old hat), but commodities like anything else. To complain that we\u2019re not happy that unregulated markets attract both desirable investors and incompetent chancers is a bit like leaving the doors and windows open and then bursting into tears when someone walks off with your television. This is the problem with neoliberal economics. Lerner may have come to Villa as a rich kid born with a silver sports franchise in his mouth, unloved at the Cleveland Browns, an investor with the slightly unnerving air of a 1980s digital watch tycoon who wants to talk to you about his aura. His failure at Villa may have been hugely damaging. Duch\u00e2telet may, in retrospect, look like a rather dangerous entrepreneurial ubercapitalist with some funny ideas. But there is nothing in English law or in football regulation to stop any of these people buying up that embedded infrastructure of clubs and grounds and generational ties and acting as they will. To offer protection, in the style of the German league, would be to perform some unacceptable act, the ultimate crime of corrupting or perverting the market. And so here we are, two grand old clubs thrashing about hoping for the right kind of buyout next time, the right kind of gambler, the right kind of monied weirdo. As ever it will be supporters, those whose lives are bound up in that funny old unconditional love who will fight the worst of it. Perhaps with some proper regulation, a little unashamed protectionism, we could all decide to give them a hand one of these days.", "title": "Aston Villa and Charlton: two clubs contorted by a new style of disastrous ownership | Barney Ronay", "sentences": ["The home defeat by Derby County last weekend brought huge protests outside the ground, with people dressed as Bedouin holding inflatable palm trees, a slightly confusing reference to the chief exec\u2019s recent 10-day holiday in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-04-22T13:14:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/22/american-chess-battle-russia-china-india", "tags": ["Chess", "Sport"], "article": "American chess, bankrolled by the billionaire Maecenas Rex Sinquefield and with help from Garry Kasparov, is limbering up for a serious struggle with the game\u2019s other superpowers Russia, China and India.

At the other end of the line, migrant workers have convened to discuss how to help.

Across the country, where the quake killed almost 9,000 people and destroyed an estimated 600,000 houses (pdf), people still sleep in makeshift tin shacks amid heaps of rubble \u2013 with an estimated four million in sub-standard temporary shelters. As they wait for the government to deliver aid, families sink deeper into an economic slump. If the approaching monsoon season wasn\u2019t worrying enough, much of Sindhupalchowk is also experiencing a dire water crisis, as the quake destroyed pipes and dried up sources. The economic consequences are severe. With barely enough water for humans, let alone animals, villages have had to give away cattle. The earthquake lasted approximately 50 seconds but it will upend people\u2019s lives for years. The scale of suffering in this mountainous district east of Kathmandu is staggering. One in seven of the 22,733 people killed in natural disasters worldwide last year was from Sindhupalchowk.   Related: Earthquake survivors left stranded in Nepal as red tape stops aid flowing    It could have been even worse. In Katunjebani, a village a few kilometres from the gathering, no one was killed because the quake occurred when they were working in the fields. But the cattle were locked up inside, and all died. \u201cI was sick and lying in bed when the earthquake hit. I had a fever and everything came tumbling down,\u201d 80-year-old Sabitri Upadhyaya recalls. Childless and a widow since her husband died 16 years ago, she is used to taking care of herself but is running out of means. \u201cMy neighbours and I are old and feeble. No one has come here to help us. I wanted to protest but I\u2019m too old and I don\u2019t have the energy,\u201d she says, not bothering to wipe away tears. Like many fellow villagers who were unable to show financial assets to the bank, Upadhyaya had taken out a private loan to construct a shed for new cattle. Such loans carry interest rates of up to 24% a month, according to several villagers. A $200m World Bank grant has allowed the Nepalese government to promise 200,000 rupees (\u00a31,335) to 100,000 families each to rebuild their homes. But the money has stalled, due to political gridlock that, until recently, delayed the establishment of the National Reconstruction Authority, the body responsible for distributing the aid. Fewer than 700 families have received the first instalment of \u00a3335. Most affected families have received only 25,000 rupeesand basic food and winter items. Even if delivered, the promised money is a pittance compared with what people lost, and nowhere near sufficient to build a new house. With household economies gutted by a year of struggling for survival, there are more immediate concerns. For 22-year-old Usha Parajuli, eight months pregnant, the financial pressure has become a source of great anxiety. Her husband lost his job as a clerk in Kathmandu due to the recent constitutional protests and blockade of Nepal\u2019s border posts with India, which exacerbated the troubles of the Nepalese.

When asked if she blames the government, she says: \u201cOf course we are angry, but we don\u2019t know which door to knock on. We are powerless.\u201d Not all villages are left to their own devices. International agencies are assisting some of the most vulnerable. Near Tamche village, Christian Aid has installed a 10,000-litre tank and a pump to transport water uphill to the village, where it built temporary shelters for 52 households. The project is partly funded by a \u20ac900,000 (\u00a3726,000) grant from Echo, the European commission\u2019s department for humanitarian aid, which has given \u20ac16.4m to Nepal since the earthquake. International donors pledged $4.4bn (\u00a33.1bn) to reconstruction in Nepal, of which the European commission pledged more than $120m (pdf). However, most of that money is still on hold.

Related: A year after the Bali Nine executions, Indonesia prepares firing squads again    Mary Jane Veloso won sympathy in her home country of the Philippines, as well as within Indonesia, after she said she was duped into smuggling drugs. And in a shock turnaround, Indonesian president Joko Widodo \u2013 known as Jokowi \u2013 delayed her killing with a temporary reprieve just hours before she was due to be executed in April 2015. Indonesia shot dead eight others that night, including two Australians, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who fought a years-long campaign for clemency and were part of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring. Four Nigerians, a Brazilian and an Indonesian were also killed. Sparing the domestic worker and mother-of-two was unexpected and several Filipino newspapers wrongly reported on their front pages the next day that she had been killed. The Philippine Daily Inquirer ran the headline: \u201cDeath came before Dawn.\u201d     Some Philippine newspapers missed the last-minute reprieve for Mary-Jane Veloso.    But in the year that has passed, the outburst of joy and relief has given way to a lengthy human trafficking trial in the Philippines and no guarantees that Veloso will be taken off death row even if she can prove she was tricked. Migrante International, a group that promotes the rights of overseas Filipino workers, says Veloso\u2019s life depends of the speedy trial and conviction of her accused traffickers, Maria Kristina Sergio and Julius Lacanilao. But the group complains that the defence has employed delaying tactics by filing motion after motion to keep the case in the early stages of legal proceedings. \u201cMary Jane is still facing the threat of execution,\u201d Migrante International vice-chair Rina Anastacio told the Guardian. \u201cUnfortunately the trial is going very slowly.\u201d     Mary-Jane Veloso pictured in Wirogunan prison, Yogyakarta, this week, taking part in a celebration of women\u2019s rights during Kartini day. Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images    Hours before Veloso was due to be killed last year, Sergio handed herself in to police in Manila, and the Philippines president, Benigno Aquino, made an appeal to his Indonesian counterpart on the basis that Veloso would be needed as a witness in the case against her alleged recruiter. Key to the last-minute reprieve was that the Philippines invoked a regional treaty (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations mutual legal assistance treaty, or Asean MLAT) signed to fight transnational crimes in south-east Asia, which obliges Indonesia to help provide Veloso as a witness to the human trafficking court case. Filipino officials have travelled to Indonesia to discuss the case that they hope can save her life.   Related: Death row in Indonesia: the prisoners who face the firing squad    Activists fear that Veloso, who has already been convicted in an Indonesian court, could yet be executed if the trial is overly delayed, as she is being kept alive only to give testimony. Her supporters want the Indonesian government to allow Veloso to fly home so she can testify in person in court. They hope a swift conviction in the Philippines will show that Veloso was a pawn and might persuade Indonesia to spare her life. The plan is far from certain. Indonesian officials suggest executions could restart again this year after a short hiatus, and the attorney general said in January the country was \u201cready\u201d to execute Veloso. Attorney general Prasetyo told Rappler: \u201cWe will look at the verdict, perhaps the verdict can be new evidence to appeal for clemency from the president. But surely Mary Jane will not be free from punishment. The fact is that she smuggled drugs to Indonesia.\u201d Veloso\u2019s lawyer Edre Olalia lamented the slow pace of the human trafficking case. \u201cAfter one year, we have unfortunately only presented her sister as prosecution witness so far.

Veloso, who fled Dubai after an attempted rape and moved to Indonesia via Malaysia to find work, says she was tricked by a trafficking gang to smuggle 2.6kg (5.7lb) of heroin six years ago.

Stowaway is a show that knows it\u2019s not just the story that matters, but how it is presented too. That\u2019s neatly handled in a fragmented production, with a set dominated by the skeletal fuselage of a plane which doubles as the Dubai construction site. The show combines sound and movement to good effect to give a sense of many stories unfolding simultaneously and a babble of conflicting viewpoints.  It doesn\u2019t all work. The decision not to start telling the story of Aditya (Devesh Kishore), the young Indian man whose journey ends in a south-west London car park, until much later leaves us too long in the company of the dull domestic situation of Andy and Debbie, and the self-absorbed Lisa whose idea of investigation is to book herself into a luxury Dubai hotel.

Then the story really takes flight as Aditya dreams of changing the life of himself and his family by signing up to be a construction worker in Dubai, only to see his hopes turn to dust in the desert.

Staring back at him from the entrance, Youssef is just as confused. They stand there, several metres apart. Neither knows what to do next. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re not delighted to see each other. It\u2019s just that this encounter, on a cold October day in a quiet town in Bavaria, is unlike anything they\u2019re used to. Mohammad and Youssef last saw each other in mid-August in Damascus, the Syrian capital. Then Youssef left for Turkey, took a boat to Greece and made his way through the Balkans to Germany. A month later, Mohammad followed him. They knew they might never see each other again \u2013 and yet, six weeks on, they\u2019re together once more. They\u2019re in a peaceful country, where they don\u2019t speak the language, and where for the first time in their lives they can be open about who they are. And who they love. It\u2019s Mohammad who first tests the parameters of this strange new world. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d he asks. *** I first met 23-year-old Mohammad at another train station, in much more chaotic circumstances, several hundred miles to the south. It was mid-September last year and we were in Tovarnik, a placid Croatian village just over the border from Serbia. Crammed into the village\u2019s tiny station were hundreds of refugees; confused and dehydrated, waiting for specially-commissioned trains that would move them on towards Germany. The trains arrived only once a day, and each train had space for 1,000, even with people crammed into the aisles. There must already have been 1,500 waiting in the station. When the train finally arrived, well past midnight, pandemonium ensued. Crowds of Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans surged forward, squeezing through gaps in the police lines. The biggest men made it onboard first, and attempted to haul their relatives on afterwards. There were raised fists and a few shoves \u2013 understandably, given the situation. If you\u2019re separated from your family here, you might all end up in different countries. You might never see each other again. The carriages filled up, but the tension didn\u2019t end. The train simply stood there on the tracks all night. From the windows, refugees gazed out, too exhausted to ask when it would finally leave, but too tense to fall asleep. Still more people arrived throughout the night, having walked from Serbia. One of them was a bespectacled biomedical engineer called Mohammad el-Haiba. I got to know lots of people like Mohammad last year. As the Guardian\u2019s migration correspondent, I travelled to 17 countries affected by the refugee crisis. I met people in surreal, chaotic places such as this one: a detention centre in Libya, a sports stadium in Kos, a riverside in Serbia. These were places entirely removed from the normal life they were searching for. Mohammad told me he wanted to live with his boyfriend, and to study in a laboratory that wasn\u2019t in a war zone. Zahraa, a student who arrived at the station in Mohammad\u2019s group, wanted to go to university without fear of being killed by militias. Ehsan, a 40-year-old engineer I met in Kos, longed for a place where his children could live without being hit by rockets on their way to school. I heard their hopes and dreams, then wished them well as they moved on. But I never knew whether they\u2019d succeed \u2013 whether they\u2019d get asylum, whether they\u2019d be able to integrate. They had made the journey of their lives \u2013 but who knew what lay ahead? *** Ehsan struggles to get to sleep most nights. He lies on his bed in Belgium, shuts his eyes, and his mind races: why haven\u2019t my papers been approved yet? Will I ever get them? How do they decide? Living in legal limbo, the only thing Ehsan can think about is how to escape it. He tells me that in his dorm of eight Syrians, in a reception centre in rural Belgium, half of them spend every night tossing and turning, unable to sleep. Some listen to music on their headsets. Others skim the news on their phones. But mainly they wonder when, if ever, they\u2019ll be granted asylum.     Mohammad el-Haiba is now living in Berlin with his boyfriend, Youssef. Photograph: Michael Danner for the Guardian    In the small hours, one by one they give up on the idea of sleep. They leave the dorm for the common room outside, and discuss the mysteries of the Belgian asylum system. Why did one recent arrival get an interview so quickly, but not the man who arrived months ago? Do they choose people based on their age, or their origin? Ehsan has been trapped, one way or another, since the week he arrived in Europe last summer. Along with 40 others, he and his 18-year-old nephew Karim had taken a rubber dinghy that reached the Greek island of Kos early one August morning. I met him there, and he told me: \u201cToday in Damascus, there were 50 rockets falling on the city. It\u2019s not about me. When my time comes, my time comes. But I\u2019m thinking about my kids. I want them to have a future.\u201d Ehsan felt the journey was too dangerous for his wife and two young children; he planned to apply for them to join him once he won asylum in Europe. The situation on Kos proved his point. In previous weeks, the island authorities had given refugees a laissez-passer to the mainland within a couple of days of arrival. But soon the flow of people was so great that the police could no longer cope. More than 7,000 refugees were stuck on the island as officials struggled to deal with the backlog. Many began sleeping on the beaches, as tourists with ice creams walked by. In an effort to create some kind of order, the island\u2019s mayor ordered all Syrians into an old sports stadium \u2013 and then locked the doors. The aim was to fast-track their paperwork, but to the Syrians wilting in the summer heat, that wasn\u2019t immediately obvious. As the temperature soared, people began to faint. There were clashes. The Syrians were beaten back with shields and truncheons, and sprayed with fire extinguishers. Gradually, people were given their papers. \u201cWater,\u201d a Syrian banker gasped as I greeted him on his exit. \u201cAll I want is water.\u201d    I miss everything about Syria. We are all disappointed here. We are near the point of breaking down    At about 2am, a day and a half after he was first locked inside, Ehsan was one of the last to be released from the stadium. I spoke to him and Karim moments later, in the darkness outside the gates. Karim was dressed neatly in a smart shirt tucked in at the waist; he hoped to study engineering. \u201cI got 91% in my high school exams,\u201d he told me. \u201cI want to go to university and get a degree, but you can\u2019t do that in Syria. Rockets fall every day. There\u2019s no electricity and no water, and checkpoints everywhere.\u201d Ehsan and Karim felt humiliated by their experiences in the stadium, but for Ehsan the shame would be worth it if he won asylum in Belgium: \u201cI don\u2019t know if Europe will be heaven or hell,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut I just want a place for my kids.\u201d Ehsan hadn\u2019t been living in Syria for long before he decided to leave. He had spent nearly 10 years in Dubai, where he led a happy life and managed a metal factory. But then he lost his job, and with it the right to live in the UAE. Three years into the Syrian civil war, he returned to Damascus with his family. There, he was blacklisted by the government after a friend reported him for criticising the regime in private. Ehsan fled first to Turkey, where he couldn\u2019t find work. Within a few months, he left again for Europe, hoping to reach relatives in Belgium. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to be moving about like this, but in Turkey there is no stability for Syrians, and in Syria you don\u2019t know when the rockets will fall on you, or when they will come and take you.\u201d His preliminary asylum interview was in September, not all that long after he and Karim arrived in Belgium. Or at least, it would have been were it not postponed some seven hours after he arrived at the asylum office. When Ehsan returned, he was told to come back again in October. In October, he was sent away until December. And in December he was fobbed off until February, when he was finally given a preliminary interview. He still has no idea when his second and decisive interview will be; meanwhile, Karim was given asylum months ago. With no date to aim for, Ehsan feels lost and isolated. The Paris attacks in November, partly instigated by Belgium-based jihadis, deepened his depression. He would love to work but, with no leave to remain, he cannot. \u201cNo one wants to take money to stay at home,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to work. Any kind of work will do.\u201d *** This limbo paralyses everything. Recently, Ehsan decided to join a gym; he thought a bit of swimming might help. But in his depressed state, even a swim seems too tough a task. It\u2019s the same with Flemish: he\u2019s downloaded 40 hours of lessons on his phone, but every time he starts them, he gives up. He can\u2019t focus on anything but the thought of getting asylum. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we\u2019re not passionate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s because our brains are not free.\u201d   Membership Event: The story of Europe's refugee crisis    Above all, he misses his family, whom he hasn\u2019t seen for more than a year. Mohammad, his son, is now eight, Lina, his daughter, has turned five; he missed both their birthdays. He speaks daily with them on WhatsApp, but it is never enough. \u201cI miss everything about Syria,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if I had to say one thing, I miss my family. We are all disappointed here. We are near the point of breaking down.\u201d The post gives his day a semblance of structure. The mail arrives at the Tournai centre at around 5pm and the place fizzes briefly into life. This is the moment when a tiny number of residents will receive a letter telling them when they can expect to be interviewed about their asylum claim. \u201cEveryone is waiting, passing the time until the mail comes,\u201d Ehsan says. \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t, we go back to our room again, and we wait.\u201d It\u2019s hard for Zahraa Daoud to pinpoint exactly what she finds most exciting about Germany. Maybe it\u2019s the buildings, which seem so big and grand. Maybe it\u2019s the nightlife, which had all but vanished back home in Syria. Or maybe it\u2019s the tattoos. \u201cThe drawings on people\u2019s bodies!\u201d she marvels. \u201cWe had those in Syria, but only a few.\u201d Zahraa remembers crossing the border in late September and thinking, \u201cMy dream has come true.\u201d The 23-year-old had set off two weeks earlier with her mother Nada, a former teacher, and 13 friends from her hometown in Salimiyeh, western Syria. Then came a nervous journey through regime-held territory to Lebanon, before a plane to Turkey, a smuggler\u2019s boat to Greece and a series of trains through the Balkans to Bavaria.     Zahraa Daoud and her mother, Nada, are living in a refugee centre in Stralsund, Germany. Photograph: Michael Danner for the Guardian    Over the next six weeks, they were bounced from Trier to Hamburg to Berlin, Horst, G\u00fcstrow, Schwerin and finally Stralsund. But despite the chaos of the asylum system, they managed not to lose any of the original group along the way. Zahraa was one of the youngest, but the natural leader. \u201cShe\u2019s very funny,\u201d one friend told me when I met the group on their journey through the Balkans. \u201cEveryone likes her.\u201d It was around 3am in the same tiny station in Croatia where I had met Mohammad, and they had just walked through the night from Serbia. They then spent a trying day and a half waiting for a train, with nowhere to sleep and nowhere to shelter from the 40-degree heat, apart from the shade of a few trees. Every hour or so, a rumour would spread among the waiting crowds. \u201cQitar,\u201d someone would shout \u2013 the Syrian word for train \u2013 and, within a few seconds, hundreds of people would hurry towards the platform. \u201cRumours,\u201d one of Zahraa\u2019s friends would usually sigh. \u201cAlways rumours.\u201d But once they made it on to a train, it was just a couple of days before they reached Germany. Unlike Belgium, the German asylum system is relatively swift. Zahraa\u2019s one and only interview with a caseworker took place little more than a month after her arrival. The questions were straightforward. Why had she come to Germany? Did she know any terrorists? Zahraa doesn\u2019t know any terrorists; she\u2019s in Germany to get away from them.    There are no jobs and little spare housing. Zahraa struggles to stay positive    The authorities were convinced, and within a month Zahraa had her asylum claim upheld. She jumped for joy when she found out, and hugged her mother, who had won asylum just a few days earlier. But it is just the beginning of a long slog towards assimilation. Zahraa and Nada now live in a refugee centre in an old hotel in Stralsund. It\u2019s pretty enough, an old port filled with Gothic architecture from the Hanseatic era, but quiet. There are no jobs and little spare housing. One by one Zahraa\u2019s friends have drifted away to larger towns to find work. The group of 15 has dwindled to four. Zahraa struggles to stay positive. By April, I find that Zahraa has regained her resolve. She has started college, and with school comes structure: lessons from 11am to 3pm. She has German friends and goes to a gym every day after class. She and her mother are looking for a new home, but in the meantime they are trying to make their temporary accommodation a bit more homely. Every evening, mother and daughter cook a meal in a shared kitchen. \u201cWe make anything Syrian,\u201d Zahraa smiles: molokhia soup one night, bazella wa riz (pea and rice stew) the next. \u201cI have tried,\u201d she says, \u201cto find a way to enjoy this life.\u201d *** When Mohammad first crossed the German border in September, he couldn\u2019t quite believe his journey was over. After the chaos at the station in Croatia, he became stuck again in Hungary, trapped in a packed train for 14 hours without access to water or a bathroom. In Germany, he feared more of the same. \u201cI was thinking: am I in Germany? Or is there another border I have to cross? I was so exhausted. Everyone was very ill.\u201d     Refugees trying to get on to a train at the Croatia-Serbia border, September 2015. Photograph: Getty Images    He was surprised to be treated with a bit of kindness. He was first taken to Dortmund, far from the Bavarian town where his boyfriend Youssef was living; but a kind security guard let him head back south to be closer to Youssef. At the station, a friendly young woman booked him his ticket. The second camp that Mohammad reached was in chaos. As Germany struggled to find room, refugees were being sent to virtually any empty public building. He initially found himself in a converted sports hall, where 300 refugees slept on the floor an arm\u2019s length from their neighbour. But at least he was now in the same part of the country as Youssef, even if they were in different camps. A few days later, they agreed to meet outside the station in Landshut. Finally, they were reunited. It was a strange feeling for both of them. In Syria, they loved each other in secret, never showing affection in public. As a graduate, Youssef was due to be conscripted into Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army; instead, he lived in hiding for months to evade security services, and met Mohammad indoors. \u201cHe spent three years in his apartment,\u201d Mohammad remembers. \u201cThe security services would go to his parents and ask where he was. So he hid. For three years he was like that.\u201d Mohammad and Youssef\u2019s reunion lasted just a few hours: by the end of the afternoon, both had to return to their centres. They were in the same country, finally \u2013 and in a country where they can be open about their love \u2013 but they couldn\u2019t yet live together. They tried all avenues. One official was receptive to the idea, but explained that the German state would need an official Syrian document that proved the two were partners. \u201cHow could I have this paper if it\u2019s illegal in Syria?\u201d Mohammad asked him. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I came here.\u201d They were forced to give up. Mohammad was moved to Drachselsried, a village of 3,000 residents in the Bavarian forest, where he was billeted in a block of eight flats, each filled with eight asylum-seekers. His flatmates were an eclectic mix, among them a maths lecturer, an oil engineer, a web designer, a supermarket owner and a nurse.    Mohammad studies German and hopes to take a master\u2019s in 2017. A year ago, he was living in a war zone    Thrown together in an isolated German village, they didn\u2019t all get along. Mohammad found it easier to sleep by day and wake at night, in order to get some privacy. But after a week, the group started to bond, debating all kinds of philosophical and political issues ranging from women\u2019s rights to homosexuality. Mohammad found the local people astonishingly warm. Villagers were always offering to help with transport and translation. Language lessons were offered from the first day. And, to his relief, Mohammad\u2019s interview came just a few days after his arrival. As with Zahraa, the questions were straightforward. There was just one week when Mohammad felt a flash of xenophobia. It was January, a few days after the new year, and he was pottering towards a supermarket with his friend, Kotaiba. A mother and daughter walked towards them. The pair spotted the Syrians, and quickly turned around. \u201cWhy did she do that?\u201d Mohammad wondered out loud to Kotaiba. \u201cEveryone knows us here.\u201d \u201cNo idea!\u201d Kotaiba replied. The two Syrians walked on. Another woman approached, spotted the young men \u2013 and turned around. It all seemed very strange, until the pair returned home and checked the latest news. Hundreds of women had been assaulted and robbed during New Year celebrations in several cities, including Cologne. The attacks had been blamed on refugees. Like many Syrians, Mohammad was shocked, but wonders if it was fair to scapegoat Syrians. \u201cFirst they said it was refugees,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThen they said it wasn\u2019t Syrians, it was the Afghans and Iraqis. And then they said it wasn\u2019t refugees, but north Africans.\u201d The backlash, at any rate, was short-lived. In time, the people of Drachselsried went back to greeting Mohammad in the street. Youssef won asylum in November, Mohammad in January. They are now living together in Berlin, in the spare room of a German family \u2013 a child psychologist, an insurance broker and their four-year-old. Mohammad studies German every day and hopes to take a master\u2019s in biomedical engineering in 2017. Less than a year ago, he was living in a war zone, in love with a man who could rarely leave his house. Now he has a future \u2013 as does Youssef: he plans to resume his career as a fashion designer. They also have their dog, a fluffy white bichon called Patty, who ran into Youssef\u2019s flat in Damascus on the day Assad was re-elected president in 2014. She found it far easier to reach Germany than her owners. A friend of Youssef\u2019s, who had a scholarship to a German university, brought Patty with him on the plane. \u201cShe got to Germany before we did,\u201d Mohammad says, laughing at the irony. He worries about his brother, still stuck in Syria, and his friends, still in Turkey. He still finds it unfamiliar, being affectionate with Youssef in public. But, finally, they can be open and plan a future together. \u201cWe are spending every single minute together: cooking, studying, going out,\u201d Mohammad says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose each other. We can start life again.\u201d \u2022 Ehsan, Karim and Youssef\u2019s names have been changed to protect their families in Syria.

In short, it is about connecting all the senses and delivering it to the audience. \u201cThese are the technologies and techniques that will carry the movie and entertainment industries into the future. The future is now, not 10 years from now.\u201d Last week, in Hollywood\u2019s biggest financial deal, DreamWorks Animation, producer of the lucrative Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and Madagascar franchises, was sold for $3.8bn to NBCUniversal, the company behind some of the most successful theme\u00a0parks. The purchase is widely seen as strengthening links with Asia, now a key battleground for entertainment parks and fan merchandise. In 2012, DreamWorks was one of the first Hollywood studios to open a production base in China and the company has assiduously built up audiences in the world\u2019s second-largest film market. Its beloved animated properties will be a big boost for NBCUniversal\u2019s sales, already at $500m a year. Revenue from its theme parks also doubled between 2010 and 2015 and a new park is planned in Beijing. Announcing the purchase, which is yet to be approved by regulators, Steve Burke, head of NBCUniversal, said: \u201cHow great will it be to have Kung Fu Panda in our park when Beijing opens?\u201d The Middle East is also investing heavily in visitor attractions. A long-awaited Warner Bros billion-dollar destination, featuring comic-book heroes Superman and Batman, along with Scooby-Doo and Looney Tunes characters, is under construction in Abu Dhabi and set to open in 2018, near to a Ferrari-branded theme park. According to Warner Bros chief executive and chairman Kevin Tsujihara, it will be \u201ca fully interactive, innovative and unique experience that will allow fans of all ages to experience the most exciting aspects of Warner Bros in a completely immersive environment.\u201d No need to wait so long for IMG Worlds of Adventure in Dubai, which opens this summer. The 1.5m sq ft site will be split into four zones, each with themes taken from Marvel or the Cartoon Network. Other planned parks are concentrating on hit virtual reality games. This month, Nintendo and NBCUniversal announced a $250m collaboration on themed attractions, while a park in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, devoted to the games Assassin\u2019s Creed and Raving Rabbids is due to open in 2020. In Tokyo, the Oriental Land Company, which owns Disney\u2019s Japanese resort, plans five new attractions in the next four years.   Related: Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal to buy DreamWorks Animation in $3.8bn deal    It is also boom time for this new breed of \u201cimmersive\u201d theme park in Los Angeles. Southern California visitor attractions broke records on spending and attendance last year, and at the opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter last month, the mayor of Los Angeles spoke of drawing in 50 million visitors a year by 2020. When the $500m Harry Potter attraction opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, the evidence for his prediction was in the long queues that had, reportedly, held vigil outside the gates overnight. Last week, Disney released the first images of its 14-acre Star Wars Lands sites in Florida and California. Disney bought the Star Wars franchise in 2012 and now plans a series of feature films and attractions to follow the hugely successful release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens last Christmas. NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast, is thought to be inspired by the strategy of Disney chief executive Robert Iger, the man who orchestrated its acquisitions of Pixar Studios and Marvel Entertainment. \u201cComcast is definitely trying to emulate Disney,\u201d said Scott Krisiloff, chief investment officer at Avondale Asset Management. The idea of bringing paying visitors into a branded experience has appeal outside film and TV. Ferrari is now choosing between California and Florida for a new park and in Long Beach, Los Angeles, the Aquarium of the Pacific has raised $40m in donations to pay for an \u201cimmersive theatre\u201d with a 40-metre-long curved screen to simulate an ocean and coastal environment. On 5 May, Legoland California will open Ninjago, a one-acre \u201cNinja training space\u201d and interactive ride, allowing visitors to shoot virtual fireballs. Many parks already use technology to let guests to interact with attractions, for example by projecting the visitor\u2019s name or home town into the effects as they pass. At the end of this year, nine parks run by Six Flags will have rollercoasters equipped with virtual-reality headsets so that riders can pretend they are flying or fighting aliens. It is proving a cheaper upgrade than building new rides or employing more actors. By the summer 24 VR-equipped rollercoasters are expected to be functioning around the world. The pace of development is such that, by the time London Resort Company Holdings, the group behind the BBC and Paramount\u2019s joint 388-acre venture at Ebbsfleet, is ready to put in its planning application next year, the international competition is likely to be a whole lot scarier.", "title": "BBC in race with theme park giants to build hi-tech visitor attractions", "sentences": ["According to Warner Bros chief executive and chairman Kevin Tsujihara, it will be \u201ca fully interactive, innovative and unique experience that will allow fans of all ages to experience the most exciting aspects of Warner Bros in a completely immersive environment.\u201d No need to wait so long for IMG Worlds of Adventure in Dubai, which opens this summer."], "publicationDate": "2016-04-30T22:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/may/02/startup-of-the-year-competition-entry-whistlejacket-london", "tags": ["Small Business Showcase"], "article": "Megan Lynch, account manager of Whistlejacket London, explains why the business should win the Startup of the Year category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:   Whistlejacket was founded on the principle that the creative agency model was broken.

New research by the UN\u2019s great apes survival partnership (Grasp) points to an alarming rise in trafficking of orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos stolen from the wild, mostly to feed demand from a boom in macabre Chinese circuses.         But an increasing number are also finding their way to the private gardens and restaurants of the Gulf elite, and Grasp fears that the trade is being accelerated by celebrity endorsements.   Doug Cress, the programme\u2019s coordinator, told the Guardian: \u201cThe paparazzi shots of Paris Hilton and football star James Rodriguez and others cuddling baby orangutans at private zoos in Dubai are incredibly damaging to conservation efforts, and Grasp calls on celebrities to avoid such photo opportunities.\u201d  Photos of Paris Hilton with a dressed-up baby orangutan at the Saif Belhasas private zoo in Dubai began circulating in 2014. \u201cShe\u2019s the cutest little girl in the world,\u201d Hilton reportedly said of the ape.   Last December, the Real Madrid star James Rodriguez uploaded a photo of himself with an orangutan in Dubai to his Instagram account, despite strong condemnation by Grasp.   The rapper Kid Ink also posted an Instagram shot of himself with an orangutan dressed in baby clothes in Dubai two months ago, as did Khloe Kardashian.   None of the celebrities\u2019 agents responded to emailed requests for comment.  Cress said: \u201cThese pictures are seen by hundreds of millions of fans, and it sends the message that posing with great apes \u2013 all of which are obtained through illegal means, and face miserable lives once they grow too big and strong to hold \u2013 is okay as long as it\u2019s cute. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s illegal, and it contributes to the destruction of already endangered species.\u201d Grasp says that United Arab Emirates permitting records show that no import licenses for baby orangutans were issued that could match with the apes visible in the celebrity photographs.        Research that Grasp will publish later this year shows that 49 chimpanzees have been recovered since January 2014, a figure indicating that a minimum of 490 chimpanzees were killed during smuggling operations in this period.  Because fully-grown apes cannot be easily trafficked, smugglers prefer to steal babies from the wild. For every one baby chimpanzee taken, an average of 10 will be killed trying to defend it. But Grasp sees even this figure as the tip of the iceberg. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting a fraction of the total,\u201d said Cress. The proliferation of seizures in the Middle East is \u201cextremely worrying\u201d to the group, suggesting that regional instability is making the area an increasingly attractive transit zone for smugglers moving their cargo to Asia. A Grasp investigation is planned into the area\u2019s trade dynamics. Iraqi Kurdistan and Armenia are thought to be hotspots for the wildlife black market, while Libya has been a stopover for trafficked apes on the way to Egypt, since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. The road from Alexandria to Cairo has long been considered a \u201cswinging door\u201d out of Africa for animals being moved east, and some Red Sea Coast hotels are believed to act as holding centres. \u201cWealthy and untouchable people in Egypt own those hotels and have private zoos for guests which flush animals through at all times \u2013 and apes are a huge piece of that traffic,\u201d Cress said. \u201cIt is hard to close down because elites in the Mideast are hard to reach. It is not a public opinion thing. It is about reaching a select number of people who control the power.\u201d       The role played by Middle East elites in illegal trafficking is a growing concern for Grasp, but the end destination for stolen animals is usually the far east. In China, around a thousand theme parks for the country\u2019s emerging middle class have opened since 2000. \u201cMost of the apes there quickly end up riding bicycles and shooting each other with toy guns,\u201d Cress said. \u201cThe orangutans are used in boxing shows for cheap laughs. It is like cowboys and Indians or cops and robbers. They just clobber each other.\u201d With live gorilla\u2019s each in China selling for $42,000 \u2013 and chimpanzees for $26,000 \u2013 corruption linked to the ape trade has become widespread. Last October, Guinea\u2019s chief wildlife officer and Cites representative, Ansoumane Doumbouya, was arrested for allegedly trafficking the animals he was supposed to be protecting. Often animals are recovered by accident \u2013 one crate subdivided into six boxes and marked as carrying dogs \u2013 was sent back to Nairobi from Cairo, after fingers were seen peeping out of its slats. The traumatised baby chimps inside were eventually found going round and round on the airport carousel. In the past seven years, there were just 27 arrests around the world for trafficking in apes. A quarter of the cases were never prosecuted.

Prior to departure, at home in London, I tried to figure out a way of reaching, on foot, the desert resort of Bab al Shams, which lay about 15 miles beyond the city\u2019s ragged fringe of buy-to-let building sites. There were some tourist maps that showed the downtown area and a few primary arterial routes, but there was nothing available that had both the necessary scale for a walker \u2013 1:25,000 or better \u2013 and sufficiently accurate orientation to enable compass bearings. While the local Bedouin may to this day retain a mental map of the area, collating a myriad of little positional markers \u2013 environmental, solar and sidereal \u2013 in order to determine location and direction, everyone else presumably relied on the GPS navigation systems in their air-conditioned cars. In the end I hit on the simple if deranging idea of laying a 12in ruler against a Google Earth satellite photograph of the desert on my computer screen. This did indeed give me a means of dead-reckoning, but I had no way of determining distance accurately, and when I left the last pile of dusty breezeblocks behind and headed into the dunes, following the flickering needle of my compass, it was with the understanding I might well be spending the night beneath the stars. In fact, the bearing proved sound enough, and I arrived at the resort hotel well after dark to be informed by the receptionist (who was from Selly Oak) that there\u2019d be no alcohol served that night because it was the Prophet\u2019s birthday. It struck me then that my way-finding method was world-girdlingly ironic: when Wilfred Thesiger rode his camel this way in the late 1920s, he was the first person to undertake a systematic survey \u2013 before that, to the western eye at least, this Quarter was indeed a void. Now, less than a century later, the great sable expanse was once more sliding into a sort of zone of ignorance \u2013 a terra incognita defined not by our ignorance concerning its location or extent, but by the very technologies that allow us to traverse it with great accuracy and at speed. The first iPhone equipped with GPS tracking and mapping was also released in early 2008, so had I been a little less of a wannabe Bedouin, I could have gone equipped, and as long as I discovered shade to see what was on the screen, followed the little-blue-dot-that-was-me into the wide blue yonder. My hypothetical iPhone would have also had to have sent signals to and received them from at least four of the GPS satellites currently in orbit around the Earth; these satellites are in communication with each other, and it is this spatio-temporal triangulation that enables anyone with a smartphone, more on less anywhere on Earth, to know where they are and where they are headed. There are now 32 satellites in orbit \u2013 the original plan was for 24 \u2013 and in the 35 very odd years since the system booted-up, their impact on more or less every aspect of our lives has been incalculable. We may associate GPS mostly with the warm tones giving us turn-by-turn driving directions, but the amount of critical infrastructure that now depends on the system means that were it to go down, civilisation as we know it would very likely collapse. Greg Milner\u2019s Pinpoint tells the story of how we were navigated into this situation \u2212 conventional methods of dating place us in the 2016th year of the Common Era, but for him the clock really began ticking (if oscillating caesium atoms do, in fact, tick) at midnight on 5 January 1980 when \u2212 synchronised to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time, as determined by an averaging of more than 200 atomic clocks worldwide) \u2212 the GPS system went live. But where did it come from, this notion of a network of satellites delineating a pure, mathematically definable and Cartesian space? Milner\u2019s answer is unequivocal: \u201cWhen an Isis terrorist gets a GPS reading, the process is enabled by the United States military, which presides over every GPS calculation.\u201d In common with almost all of the amazing technological innovations that have characterised the past half-century, GPS owes its inception to the Pentagon\u2019s strategic imperatives. The indiscriminate carpet-bombing of Japan and Germany in the second world war was seen to be inefficient as well as inhumane, and the drive in the years following was to create a targeting technology so accurate it could \u201cput five bombs in the same hole\u201d. There was this driver, and there was also a pressing need for a means of intercepting Soviet ballistic missiles, as well as ensuring the US\u2019s missiles reached their targets. The first prototypes of GPS targeting systems were in use as early as the Vietnam war, but it was the Gulf war that really saw their wide-scale military adoption. The US defence department continues to oversee the system \u2013 maintenance costs about a billion a year \u2013 but day-to-day running is handled by the air force, while the 16 monitoring stations that ensure the satellite array does its job are under the control of the National Security Agency (NSA). Given, as Milner writes, that \u201cGPS is an essential part of virtually every weapons system\u201d, while the spooks have been involved with its development every precisely calibrated inch of the way, you don\u2019t have to be a paranoid conspiracy theorist to feel concerned about our dependency on it. Nor do you have to be a desert walker in order to apprehend the impact of GPS on your personal orientation and wayfinding: everyone reading this has probably had the experience of getting lost while, paradoxically, being informed of precisely where you are. GPS navigation seems to leech us of all the \u201cthick data\u201d of being in place \u2013 our sensory apprehensions, including visual, sonic and haptic cues \u2212 even as it gifts us such phenomenally accurate directions. Milner ventures a short way into the impact of the technology on our cognitive function, and even essays a few remarks on the philosophic conundrums it raises, but these issues are better dealt with in Nicholas Carr\u2019s account of the risks of automation, The Glass Cage, whereas the bulk of this book is a fairly nerdy account of the backroom whiz-kids who figured out the nuts and bolts of the system. I found Milner\u2019s account of the infighting between Pentagon and its various contractors interesting enough, just as I enjoyed his dissection of the phenomenon of \u201cdeath by GPS\u201d (in, say, desert valleys, where drivers using a satnav get lost). Milner also delves deep into the dense web of intersections between GPS \u2013 \u201cthe world\u2019s only free utility\u201d \u2013 and all those other utilities we vitally depend on, with interesting side excursions into earthquake-detection and the GPS-assisted monitoring of offenders. But I cavilled at his view that \u201cGPS reflects a choice, a conscious application of a neutral technology\u201d. Surely no technology is \u201cneutral\u201d \u2013 each bears the impress of the impetus for its development. Milner writes that: \u201cGPS itself is a blank slate on to which we project our desires. And what we desire most from it is perfect knowledge of other people\u2019s location and behaviour.\u201d A benign view of this desire is Marshall McLuhan\u2019s conception of \u201cthe global village\u201d; a rather more negative one is Jeremy Bentham\u2019s panopticon: a prison whose inmates are continuously surveilled by their jailers. A still more negative one is surely the truth: this was a technology developed in order to have perfect knowledge of other people\u2019s location and behaviour, so that they could be killed, all the other stuff is simply a rather more useful spin-off. Milner examines in some detail etak, the Polynesians\u2019 traditional navigation method, which was supplanted by western systems \u2013 whether maps or GPS \u2013 that place the individual subject at their centre. Practitioners of etak relied on a combination of very thick perceptual data, and an intuitive grasp of the relational movement between two fixed points and a third moving one (a parallax view); and it was this that enabled their astonishing diaspora. That one of these fixed points might well be an island the navigator had never actually visited teases out the enormous conceptual gulf between our worldview and theirs: whether we are laying rulers across computer screens, checking the time on our phone or using that phone to make a call, we are employing a technology that, as Milner puts it, \u201cprovides the possibility of omniscience\u201d. No wonder some of us develop the delusion that we are gods; a cosmic solecism no Polynesian \u2013 or Bedouin, for that matter \u2013 was ever guilty of. \u2022 Pinpoint is published by WW Norton in the US and by Granta in the UK in July.

The Ashes were secured last summer and, after a chastening trip to the UAE and defeat against Pakistan in November, England were victorious in South Africa. Only the odd zealot has been calling for the sacking of Alastair Cook in recent times; there is a feelgood factor about the set-up, whether the ball is red or white; the team has become more entertaining and less grumpy and they have been winning their fair share of games. All of which suggests an unusual stability except for the fact that with the first Test against Sri Lanka around the corner, beginning at Headingley on 19 May, it is uncertain who is going to bat at numbers two, three or five. It will become clear by the end of this week but today there is a fair chance that even the selectors are none too sure who will be chosen for the Test squad. The modern way is to back the man long identified as possessing the attributes of an international cricketer rather than the man in form. In the 21st century England\u2019s management are not so likely to be swayed by the hundred made last week in county cricket as the fine impression made by some youngster on an A tour or at some winter training camp in Dubai or Potchefstroom. However, there may well be a reversion to the more antiquated system this week. Form may be temporary but it may also be important especially since it is not that easy to identify the class that is always deemed permanent among most of the candidates to bat in England\u2019s upper order. Hence the selectors will theoretically be out and about with their notebooks this week (\u201ctheoretically\u201d because the likelihood is that Angus Fraser and Mick Newell will be watching the teams for which they are responsible in their primary jobs as cricket directors of Middlesex and Nottinghamshire and this is a flaw in the system). At Lord\u2019s the binoculars will presumably be trained on Alex Hales, Nick Compton, Sam Robson, Steven Finn and Jake Ball in particular. Elsewhere, runs and the odd wicket for James Vince, Ian Bell, Chris Woakes, Gary Ballance and, perhaps, Alex Lees at Old Trafford, Edgbaston and Headingley respectively could well be significant. For a young player it really makes a difference to be embarking or resuming a Test career when in good form. So the national selector, James Whitaker, may be buzzing manically around a triangle of motorways north of Birmingham to obtain the best possible evidence, which adds a bit of old-fashioned spice to the announcement of the Test squad. In England\u2019s last Test in Centurion, where they were heavily defeated, Hales, Compton and James Taylor batted at two, three and five. Very sadly Taylor is no longer available as a result of the discovery of his heart condition. He was in possession of the No5 slot and would have been selected \u2013 though it would be wrong to suggest, despite the understandable torrent of sympathy heading in his direction, that he had nailed down that position. Hales delayed his return to county cricket, having been ever-present for England in all formats since the start of the tour to South Africa, and he has therefore missed out on scoring vats of runs on the batsmen-friendly pitches of this springtime. Against Yorkshire he produced two contrasting innings \u2013 36 from 53 balls in the first innings, 34 from 115 balls in the second. The likelihood is that he will retain his place, but those two innings of such contrasting tempos hint at an important reservation. There is no cast-iron evidence that Hales knows how he plays best in the longest form of the game. At Test level the best players generally bat the same way in every innings without bending too much to the situation; they know exactly how they will score their runs and how aggressive they will be. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not, but the method employed by Cook or Joe Root, Kane Williamson or Virat Kohli never really changes. Hales is still searching for the right balance. Given that his strength is hardly the possession of a watertight technique, he is probably best advised to stick with his aggressive instincts. But that is tough under the scrutiny of Test cricket, especially if one is out of form. Cook\u2019s previous opening partners, Robson and Adam Lyth, were given seven Tests (Compton had nine first time around) and the same may apply for Hales. This leaves two out of Compton, Vince and Ballance in the frame unless a second sparkling hundred of the season for Bell at Edgbaston against Somerset prompts the selectors to recall the old boy (Bell is 15 months older than Compton). The selectors seem ready to explore and that probably means Vince being given a Test debut either at three or five, depending upon which Old Harrovian the selectors plump for. Compton and Ballance can produce figures to enhance their cause. Compton was more productive than Hales, Taylor or, indeed, Cook in the series against South Africa, when he averaged 30. Ballance has a Test average of 47. The concerns are that Compton grows ever more tense as a series progresses and that Ballance is still technically uncomfortable. Down the line the batting conundrum might well be resolved by Jonny Bairstow being promoted up the order and Jos Buttler returning as wicketkeeper. The selectors are unlikely to dwell so long on the bowling line-up for Headingley. Finn will presumably reunite with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, while Nottinghamshire\u2019s Ball seems to have leapfrogged a few so he may well be the reserve paceman in the squad.

The passengers flocking to Fenchurch Street station every evening fall largely into the latter category, having come to loathe their long journey home to Essex. A new timetable introduced before Christmas means fewer carriages and more stops in the capital, making the c2c rush-hour trains some of the most crowded in the country. The south Essex line became notorious back in January when one commuter reportedly wet himself because there was no way of getting to the toilet through a crushed aisle. \u201cIn the end he just couldn\u2019t hold it,\u201d said a despairing fellow passenger. James Savill is one of the angry travellers who finds he often has to stand all the way home \u2013 almost 50 minutes to the town of Stanford-le-Hope. The 37-year-old insurance executive now uses @c2c_customers to tweet photos of jam-packed carriages, and helped stage a protest at Fenchurch Street earlier this year. \u201cSome nights people are swearing at each other as they\u2019re jostling to get on,\u201d says Savill. \u201cThey\u2019re shouting at each other: \u2018Move down the train!\u2019 but there\u2019s literally no more space. I\u2019ve seen an old woman crying because she just couldn\u2019t get on at West Ham. There have been instances of staff actually pushing people on like it\u2019s India or Japan, or somewhere like that.\u201d     Commuter James Savill has become a vocal campaigner about conditions on the c2c line. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Some of Essex\u2019s c2c commuters have drawn the Conservative MP for Thurrock, Jackie Doyle-Price, into arguments on Twitter, feeling she has failed to champion their cause. Feeling harassed, Doyle-Price has accused the group of \u201ctedious\u201d trolling. Yet the anger does appear to have had an impact with the operator: c2c is to start running additional carriages later this year, three years earlier than planned. \u201cWe\u2019re a vocal bunch in Essex,\u201d says Savill. \u201cYou have to make sure your voice is heard.\u201d The south-east remains the seething epicentre of commuter fury. This year\u2019s Which? survey found the region to have the least satisfied passengers in the country. It backs up a recent study by watchdog Transport Focus showing Thameslink, Southeastern and Southern to be the nation\u2019s least-popular operators. Barely a week goes by without a new commuter petition popping up online. The most common kind pleads for a government review into the franchise of a hated operator. Other demands range from making refunds easier to making a seat for every customer a legal requirement. Where once upon a time, home counties commuters could expect a comfortable, seated journey into London before being swallowed up on the Underground, figures released by the Department for Transport last year showed that 139,000 workers coming into London \u2013 one in five \u2013 are now forced to stand all the way. The City commuter recently photographed squatting in the cleaning cupboard next to a bucket and mop (a spot he has occupied every day from Ipswich to Liverpool Street) seemed to capture the new, more crowded normal.       Overcrowding is not the only thing driving people to distraction, however. Major annoyances include the regularity of delays (across Britain, an average of 57 trains run significantly late each day) and, of course, the price of tickets: the costliest in Europe, according to the TUC and Action for Rail. There seems little prospect of passions cooling. The population of London is expected to reach 10 million by 2030, with a substantial growth in numbers \u2013 from 15 million to 17 million \u2013 expected across the wider south-east region over the same period. Feeder towns and satellite cities such as Slough, Reading, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead continue to swell in unison with the people-pulling, job-creating capital city. Will the rail network prove capable of getting all these extra worker bees into London \u2013 or is the severely under-pressure commuter system about to reach breaking point? Some are already reconsidering a routine that requires working in London and living outside the M25. Jennifer Woodside relies on a Southern train from Polegate, deep in East Sussex, to get her to a charity communications job in London: \u201cIt\u2019s just such an atrocious service that commuting has become a real strain,\u201d says the 49-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019m paying \u00a34,000 a year for a service that constantly gets me in late. It\u2019s somewhere between five and 15 minutes late into Clapham Junction pretty much every day, and at least once a month it\u2019ll be more 30 minutes late. Sometimes the announcer tells you about signalling failure, sometimes it\u2019s because someone\u2019s been taken ill \u2013 you\u2019ll hear two or three different reasons on the same train.\u201d Train drivers and station announcers must be Britain\u2019s most experienced \u2013 and jaded \u2013 apologisers, spending much of their day saying \u201csorry\u201d over the public address system. Sick of the daily apology as she steps off at Clapham Junction, sick of spending three hours on a train each day, Woodside says she and her husband \u2013 who also commutes into London \u2013 are now considering a change of lifestyle. \u201cWe would both love to find work close to home,\u201d she says. \u201cWe love where we live, but we just find the commute so draining now. If everyone wants to either live in London or work in London, I don\u2019t know how the system is going to cope.\u201d Some major infrastructure projects promise to stop the city grinding to a halt. Crossrail \u2013 the newly named Elizabeth line \u2013 will provide more capacity for commuters in parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex from 2018. Crossrail 2, although at least another 15 years away, will offer yet more options and ease pressure on congested routes running into Waterloo and Liverpool Street stations. A massive franchising change is also expected. The Department for Transport has proposed giving Transport for London (TfL) control of the \u201csuburban\u201d services running into London; all commuter services coming in and out of London Bridge, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Moorgate, Victoria and Waterloo stations would be incorporated into TfL\u2019s network as contracts expire between 2017 and 2021. \u201cOnly the whole, I\u2019m hopeful TfL might take a grip of the thing,\u201d says Stephen Joseph at the Campaign for Better Transport. \u201cI don\u2019t think some improvement is too much to ask for.\u201d     James Savill: \u2018I\u2019ve seen an old woman crying because she couldn\u2019t get on at West Ham.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    But will \u201csome improvement\u201d be enough to keep up with such huge and growing demand? Lord True, the head of Richmond council, recently revealed town hall bosses had been briefed about a population forecast of 13 million for London by 2050. He suggests it is time to ask the public if it wants \u201cbroad limits\u201d enforced on the size of the capital. Daniel Moylan, a TfL board member and the Mayor of London\u2019s advisor on Crossrail 2, is also concerned about how a city of 10 million in the not-so-distant future will function. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a city of 10 million in Europe, so it remains a huge experiment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the birth rate alone means it really is going to happen, regardless of immigration.\u201d Moylan thinks there is a lack of strategic clarity from the government about whether it really wants to encourage people to move outside of London. For a while, George Osborne was keen on building brand new \u201cgarden\u201d cities in Ebsfleet and other sites in the south to absorb some of the demand. Yet fewer than 100 houses have been built at Ebsfleet, despite great fanfare two years ago about \u00a3200m of public infrastructure investment to support 15,000 new homes. In his most recent budget, the chancellor changed tack and stressed the importance of building up existing suburbs in London\u2019s outer boroughs and other cities across the UK.     One commuter\u2019s view of the packed 7.58am train from Laindon, Essex, into London. Photograph: Mark Burton-Sampson/C2C Customers    \u201cMy own view is that London should be able to accommodate its own growth,\u201d says Moylan. \u201cOne of the things we need to decide, urgently, is whether the plan is to accommodate population growth within London, to have a programme for shifting people out into new satellite towns, or to intensify development in existing satellite towns. \u201cAt the moment we jump from one policy to another. We need a proper plan, because there\u2019s all the infrastructure like sewage and electricity to consider as well as transport and housing.\u201d London currently has one very obvious limit to urban expansion: the green belt. Strict planning controls have forced housebuilding to leapfrog the ring of protected countryside ever since the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act. The government\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission, led by Lord Adonis, believes Crossrail 2 invites major housebuilding next to new stations on London\u2019s outer fringes. A recent report recommends the \u201climited release\u201d of green-belt land for development.  Yet the idea remains politically toxic. London\u2019s new mayor Sadiq Khan promised to protect the green belt in the outer boroughs during his campaign. He also promised to freeze TfL fares, a claim which all commuters will be keeping a close eye on. Richard Wellings, transport expert at the Institute for Economic Affairs, thinks this precious green belt is \u201cillogical\u201d, pushing too many people to leapfrog over it and live inefficiently far from the nation\u2019s biggest source of jobs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d he says. Still, Wellings has little sympathy with commuters who complain about living 30 or 40 miles from the office. He thinks the taxpayer is partially subsidising their lifestyle, since price regulations hold down a proportion of fares. \u201cI think commuters\u2019 frustration is misguided,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople could make a trade-off and move to a smaller house in a rougher part of east London, and still have lower overall living costs. But they choose to live in the leafy stockbroker belt, because of the schools, a bigger house and so on. New migrants to the city show it\u2019s possible to live much closer to work, even if a lot of people don\u2019t want to rough it.\u201d Christian Wolmar, a transport writer who initially competed for Labour\u2019s nomination for mayor, disagrees. \u201cWhat are people expected to do? House prices in London are pricing people out, so a lot of people don\u2019t feel they have much of a choice. And London can\u2019t function without those workers coming in to the city. We need to subsidise an improved rail system for a very good reason \u2013 it\u2019s an essential part of the economy.\u201d   Related: London, reimagined: alternative tube maps \u2013 in pictures    If London cannot spread out into the green belt, the city will also follow the model of Asian cities and expand upwards ever higher. The capital now has 436 buildings over 20 storeys in the pipeline, but skyscraper development remains deeply unpopular, inspiring endless laments that London is turning into \u201cDubai on the Thames\u201d. On the right, lobby groups such as Create Streets attack high-rise development for establishing alienating environments, while the left despises the glut of luxury towers aimed at overseas investors. For the time being, at least, wild house prices and crazy rents mean a growing number of London\u2019s workers feel forced to live far from the action. Others make the choice willingly, happy to live somewhere more affordable and put some space between themselves and the heaving, noisy city. They simply want the long commute to be less miserable; they want to feel good about making a smart trade-off. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to feel good when you\u2019re 20 minutes late, squashed between one stranger\u2019s armpit and another\u2019s elbow, and spending a small fortune on the privilege.

The England striker also revealed that his break in Dubai was made all the more enjoyable by the fact that the Sunderland players were pounding the beach across the road while he was topping up his tan. Ranieri made the bold call to give everyone an extended breather after Leicester lost 2-1 against Arsenal on Valentine\u2019s Day. With no match for a fortnight because of their FA Cup elimination, Ranieri reasoned that it was an ideal opportunity for his players to switch off from football following the injury-time defeat at Arsenal that Vardy described as a \u201ckiller blow\u201d.   Related: Leicester let Premier League joy sink in before Champions League dreams begin    The striker said: \u201cI think a good thing that helped us straight after that game was the gaffer had seen exactly how much we\u2019d all fought for each other and put into that game, and because we weren\u2019t in the week after because we\u2019d been knocked out of the FA Cup he gave us a week off to completely forget about everything and recharge the batteries. \u201cWe all ventured off, quite a few of us went to Dubai together as a team, and I think that moment, for him to even think about doing that, showed what he\u2019d thought of us as a team and how much work we\u2019d already put in. So to get those batteries recharged for that week and come back fighting stronger was a massive part [in winning the league]. \u201cIt was a great idea. I went to Dubai and I remember sitting on a sun lounger and in the same hotel Sunderland were there, running up and down the beach doing fitness. For me to be relaxing while they\u2019re doing the training was quite nice. It worked out perfectly, no one was going to go on a seven-day bender. It was a case of being there to relax with family and that\u2019s all we did until we got back to training.\u201d Speaking at the launch of his V9 Academy in Manchester, which has been set up to give non-league players a chance to break into the professional game and follow in his own footsteps, Vardy was on good form as he reflected on winning the league with Leicester and that slightly mischievous tweet he sent out showing the Lion King\u2019s Mufasa falling down a cliff. \u201cThat\u2019s just my favourite kids\u2019 film!\u201d he said, smiling. Vardy posted that picture immediately after Leicester claimed the title on the back of Tottenham Hotspur being held to a 2-2 draw at Chelsea, and in response to the picture Harry Kane had put on Instagram after Ranieri\u2019s side had dropped points at home against West Ham United a fortnight earlier. Kane\u2019s image showed a pack of lions about to go a hunt. Asked whether there was a friendly rivalry between himself and Kane, who could be playing alongside one another at Euro 2016 this summer, Vardy replied: \u201cWe\u2019re away with England to do a job for England and that\u2019s all we focus on while we\u2019re there. After that when you go back to your own clubs, I\u2019m sure a few of us can put a few pictures out and let the media join the dots up themselves.\u201d           Leicester City: their Premier League title glory in numbers    Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, has criticised other managers and players for expressing their \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d about who they wanted to win the title before it had been decided and implied that some clubs may have got caught up in the Leicester fairytale, yet Vardy was dismissive of the idea that his team benefited in any way during the run-in. \u201cI can\u2019t see any team doing that, to be honest with you. I don\u2019t think anyone would like to just turn up and be rolled over to let someone else win, I don\u2019t think that is inside anyone, it wouldn\u2019t look good on the club if they were doing that and I\u2019m sure the fans wouldn\u2019t like it. So I can\u2019t see that being true whatsoever.\u201d Vardy\u2019s Premier League winners\u2019 medal is hung up by the side of his bed and he has not given up hope of picking up the golden boot to go along with the Football Writers\u2019 player of the year award that he will receive in London on Thursday. He is on 24 league goals, level with Sergio Ag\u00fcero and one behind Kane with the trip to Stamford Bridge to come on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019d have been level if I\u2019d not put that penalty in the garden,\u201d he said, smiling at the memory of the spot-kick that sailed over the crossbar in the 3-1 win against Everton on Saturday and which cost him the chance of a first Premier League hat-trick. Alluding to the team spirit that has been such a cornerstone of Leicester\u2019s success, Vardy described his team-mates as being like \u201cbrothers\u201d and said that the camaraderie among them is \u201cthe main thing that has got us where we are\u201d. He expressed his hope that their achievements this season will keep the squad together. The 29-year-old also suggested that his own future \u2013 in February he signed a contract extension until 2019 \u2013 is secure. \u201cWe\u2019ve just won the league and will be playing in the Champions League next year. I am happy here,\u201d Vardy said. Vardy\u2019s rag-to-riches story is the inspiration behind his academy, which receives its first intake of players in May next year. Held at Manchester City\u2019s Etihad Campus, the academy will host 42 non-league players across five days and offer elite coaching as well as the opportunity to train and play in front of scouts from professional clubs. Sat alongside his agent, John Morris, who is the co-founder of the V9 Academy, Vardy talked about wanting to \u201cgive something back\u201d after his own experiences in non-league football. Released from Sheffield Wednesday at the age of 16 for being too small, Vardy spent seven years with Stocksbridge Park Steels and another two with Halifax and Fleetwood Town before breaking into the professional game with Leicester at the age of 25. \u201cI think you have got to give everyone the full time to develop, to see how big and strong they become, up until 21,\u201d Vardy said. \u201cIt is a long time to keep someone on, for teams to hope you are going to fulfil that potential. But [it cannot be right if] you\u2019re telling them six years previously. When I was released, I was only 4ft 11in, so I probably was too small. Two months later I had a massive growth spurt, so who knows what difference it would have made. I doubted myself as soon as I got released. It was my boyhood club, I had made them the highlight of everything. To be told at that age I was not big enough or strong enough was hard to take. The important thing was playing non-league football and enjoying it again, but it was a long hard process.\u201d For information about the V9 Academy, see www.V9academy.co.uk", "title": "Leicester\u2019s Jamie Vardy praises Ranieri\u2019s foresight in title-winning run", "sentences": ["The England striker also revealed that his break in Dubai was made all the more enjoyable by the fact that the Sunderland players were pounding the beach across the road while he was topping up his tan.", "\u201cWe all ventured off, quite a few of us went to Dubai together as a team, and I think that moment, for him to even think about doing that, showed what he\u2019d thought of us as a team and how much work we\u2019d already put in.", "I went to Dubai and I remember sitting on a sun lounger and in the same hotel Sunderland were there, running up and down the beach doing fitness."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-09T19:30:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/james-vince-jake-ball-england-test-squad-sri-lanka", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Sri Lanka cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "England v Sri Lanka 2016"], "article": "James Vince and Jake Ball are the new faces in England\u2019s Test squad to face Sri Lanka at Headingley next week, with the selectors keeping faith with the bulk of the side who won in South Africa over the winter.

Alex Hales will continue as the captain Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner, with his Nottinghamshire team-mate Ball earning a first senior call-up after taking 19 wickets in his first four championship fixtures this season, to see him joint top of the bowling statistics in Division One.

Vince\u2019s selection comes after impressing the England management both as the captain of the Lions and as a squad member during the World Twenty20 campaign; his century against Yorkshire\u2019s championship-winning attack last month came with the national selector, James Whitaker, in attendance. The 25-year-old right-hander had been seen as a contender to replace Compton, whose second spell in the England side had started well in the 2-1 win over South Africa when he held the batting together in the victory at Durban, only for his form to fall away during in the series. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been aiming for since I was a little kid really,\u201d said Vince. \u201cDefinitely when I was growing up, playing for England in a Test was still the number one. I\u2019ve had the experience of the T20s in Dubai against Pakistan, when it was a good feeling being able to contribute to the team. Being in the World T20 squad was a great experience as well, although obviously I would have liked to have played more of a part. Since then I\u2019ve turned my attention to Hampshire and trying to have a good start to the season. It\u2019s only the last week when I started to notice stuff in the press.

It was a new world to me.\u201d The architect Luis Miguel Velez Wiesner is recalling the first time he set foot in Santo Domingo, one of Colombia\u2019s most notorious comunas (slums), when the Medell\u00edn cable car opened in 2004. \u201cThe first time, I felt like I was going to be kidnapped. Now it\u2019s quite different \u2013 there are lots of places to eat and shop. It feels safe now.\u201d For intrepid residents such as Wiesner, stepping off the cable car to enter the once out of bounds \u201cother side\u201d of Medell\u00edn, was a seminal moment in the history of their city. Their photos in front of Giancarlo Mazzanti\u2019s dramatic new Espa\u00f1a library in Santo Domingo sent an altogether different image of Medell\u00edn to the world. The long-entrenched division between the gridded city in the valley and the informal settlements on the hills was finally disappearing. The world\u2019s most dangerous city had become accessible, and safe. \u201cI always lived in a gated compound,\u201d Wiesner says. \u201cWhen we were young, my mother was afraid when we had to leave the house. We were in a shopping mall once when a bomb exploded. It was quite normal. It\u2019s really different now though \u2013 they\u2019re not shooting everyone, everywhere.\u201d Medell\u00edn\u2019s revival is a story of dynamic interplays between key figures on either side of the divide \u2013 not least mayors Luis Perez, Sergio Fajardo and Alonso Salazar, and the drug lords Pablo Escobar and Don Berna \u2013 and of radical experiments in urban planning and participatory forms of governance.     Police and military forces storm the rooftop where Pablo Escobar was shot dead in 1993. Photograph: Jesus Abad-El Colombiano/AFP/Getty Images    No account of Medell\u00edn can be written without considering Escobar\u2019s role in masterminding and controlling the city\u2019s fortunes. It might seem a little unorthodox to consider one of the world\u2019s most powerful and violent criminals an urban planner, but to ignore his role in the story of Medell\u00edn\u2019s development would be to grossly distort history. Escobar and his cartels helped set the conditions for urban change to happen. They led Medell\u00edn to the brink of disaster, then demanded it change. In 1982, Escobar launched his \u201cMedell\u00edn Without Slums\u201d programme \u2013 a politically motivated but nonetheless heartfelt campaign to rid the city of its slums and provide a \u201clife of noble dignity\u201d for the urban poor who, in Escobar\u2019s words, had been living in an \u201cinferno of garbage\u201d. Besides increasing his popularity, power and even election-winning potential \u2013 Escobar was elected to Colombia\u2019s house of representatives for a brief period in 1982, before his associations with drug trafficking had him expelled \u2013 Medell\u00edn Without Slums was the first effort to make change for the poor from within. Through it, Escobar \u2013 who was eventually shot and killed by security forces in December 1993 \u2013 gave the city\u2019s comunas a political voice and a vehicle through which to demand change. He radicalised, politicised and militarised the poor, turning them against the citizens of the formal city in all-out civil war. Escobar\u2019s legacy, in planning terms, was this transformation of the spatial divide between formal and informal territories, between rich and poor, into a violent opposition of territories.

Photograph: Alamy    At one point, Medell\u00edn was the most dangerous city on earth. From 1990 to 1993, more than 6,000 people were murdered annually, and not just in the slums. Drive-by shooting was regular and indiscriminate. The accounts of suffering and violence are truly obscene \u2013 not simply of warfare between gang lords and drug criminals, but of children being tortured and mutilated for accidentally crossing an invisible territorial boundary, of growing up with homicides taking place in their bedrooms, of bullets flying through their curtains at dinner. The need for change was urgent \u2013 and perhaps only such extreme conditions could have led to such radical urban experimentation. According to Colombian architect and UCL lecturer Catalina Ortiz, who worked on Medell\u00edn\u2019s strategic city plans of 2005 and 2013 under Mayor Fajardo, the critical moment came a quarter of a century ago. \u201cFor me, 1991 was a key turning point for the whole country. It was the worst and the best moment \u2013 a time of complete crisis and a moment of hope,\u201d Ortiz says. \u201cIt was truly a moment where everyone felt it could not get any worse \u2013 we had to do something.\u201d    Medell\u00edn\u2019s security issues could not be dealt with through policy measures alone  Catalina Ortiz     The country\u2019s new constitution, ratified that year, gave greater independence to local governments to elect their own leaders, offering more control over urban development to local people with local knowledge and expertise. It was also the moment when the national government, with international support from the United Nations, started to intervene in Medell\u00edn, dismantling and demobilising guerrilla paramilitary groups. \u201cThe interest of the national government was an acknowledgement that the situation was out of control,\u201d Ortiz explains. \u201cThey recognised that governance in Medell\u00edn had been lost.\u201d But this was also a key moment for urban planning \u2013 the point at which the city\u2019s issues were considered a matter of urban design. \u201cThe government recognised that Medell\u00edn\u2019s security issues could not be dealt with through policy measures alone. It was the point at which the governing entities started to recognise and address the urban context of the problem,\u201d Ortiz says.

Photograph: Raul Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images    Medell\u00edn\u2019s authorities started a series of radical programmes to reorganise the social fabric of the comunas and mobilise the poor. The city\u2019s planners began addressing its endemic violence and inequity through the design of public spaces, transit infrastructure and urban interventions into the slums. Key to their approach was a commitment to the public realm as a truly shared space, and a faith that they could transform Medell\u00edn\u2019s public spaces from sites of segregation and warfare into spaces where communities would come together. But Medell\u00edn\u2019s social urbanism stretches way beyond the more modest experiments with participatory planning and community consultation that are now vogue in cities across the globe. The sheer enormity and complexity of the issues here demanded something unique \u2013 an urbanism of inclusion, where the dispossessed became partners in driving urban change. Influenced by European regeneration models, notably in Barcelona, Medell\u00edn\u2019s 1995 and 1999 strategic plans set a new agenda for the city. \u201cThey redefined the realm of what \u2018public work\u2019 is. Participatory planning became a key question of social equity,\u201d Ortiz explains. In 1998, it became constitutional law in Colombia that every municipality had to develop a masterplan, and that planning could not happen without social participation. Into this situation parachuted mayor Fajardo and the architect Alejandro Echeverri. Fajardo surrounded himself by a team of experts and specialists at his Urban Development Corporation (EDU), working with architects, planners, engineers and sociologists to collectively manage Medell\u00edn\u2019s change. On many projects, the design team worked with a \u201cman on the ground\u201d \u2013 a community representative who was mouthpiece and interpreter for the community in which interventions were being proposed.     Cable cars and escalators now carry tens of thousands of people a day between Medell\u00edn\u2019s comunas and the city centre. Photograph: imagebroker/Alamy    Echeverri says this level of collaboration and integration of professions and disciplines was fundamental to the success of Medell\u00edn\u2019s projects \u2013 which meant also having to \u201ccall on the bad guys\u201d to help. He explains: \u201cOften the person we needed to deliver the plan was one of the bad guys, part of the problem.\u201d In a context as divided and oppositional as this, where the establishment was hated and figures of authority treated with distrust, the gulf between the rich and the poor, the authority and the individual, had to be bridged through joint decision-making and co-design. Unlike previous political figures, Fajardo was often present at community meetings in the comunas. His team held \u201cimagination workshops\u201d in which comuna dwellers were given the opportunity to imagine alternatives; to redesign where they lived. The EDU achieved a truly integrated form of participatory planning, establishing a common ground between once warring factions and a common will to make change.  The projects were seen as chains of interventions that stitched the city together. Integrated mobility systems consisting of elevated metros, cable cars, bridges and escalators were planned to keep the city moving and link previously disconnected neighbourhoods. These were accompanied by socially minded, architectural-scale interventions in the poorest areas: libraries, community buildings and cultural centres \u2013 places for people to come together, interact and learn. Fajardo invested in Medell\u00edn\u2019s civic centre as well as the slums; a two-pronged approach that legitimated the previously neglected comunas by treating them as equal parts of the whole city. Architecturally, one of Echeverri\u2019s major successes was striking a balance between the embedded and the iconic \u2013 integrating spaces, places and systems into the social fabric of the city on the one hand, while also creating buildings of international quality which would be photographed again and again.     Former mayor Sergio Fajardo focused on developing downtown Medell\u00edn as well as the comunas. Photograph: Alamy    But as well as sending a new image of the city to the world, changing its reputation and attracting a tourist economy, there is a more subtle design intelligence at play here. Watching people slide up and down the brightly coloured escalators in Comuna 13 (still believed to be one of Medell\u00edn\u2019s most dangerous comunas), with their decorative metal canopies, air-conditioning and soft music, set against the haphazard irregularity of the slum, is a collision of worlds. And perhaps this is key to the success of the projects: bringing two alien worlds together and forcing them to interact, adjust to one another, and forge a new identity.  Fajardo was something of a political anomaly. A maths professor with no previous background in politics, he managed to overcome the traditional political parties, all rife with corruption, to become mayor in 2003 with no tarnish. He used this autonomy well, entering political and spatial territories that were previously out of bounds. His independence enabled people to accept him and get to know him \u2013 the new mayor from nowhere who walked in the city\u2019s slums. Many explain Medell\u00edn\u2019s relative stability between 2003 and 2009 as thanks to an accord between the city\u2019s two independent leaders, Fajardo and drug lord Don Berna \u2013 both of whom commanded peace and calm from different sides of Medell\u00edn\u2019s divide. In establishing the EDU, Fajardo instigated a bureaucratic independence \u2013 free of Medell\u00edn\u2019s corrupt and inefficient ways \u2013 that was key to the city\u2019s successes. This independence allowed the EDU to look freely at the city as a whole, enabling its experimental and visionary approach that exceeded what previous authorities had achieved. In this, it is a lesson to cities around the world of the importance of independent design bureaus working alongside local authorities.   Related: Story of cities #43: how Dubai's World Trade Centre sold the city to the world    Another crucial form of independence concerns autonomy of funding, in the form of the public utilities company EPM. A unique institution, the EPM is owned by the city municipality, and is a wealthy institution that exports energy to the rest of Colombia and other parts of South America too. The 1991 constitution decided that the EPM would contribute 30% of its profit to the city for municipal use \u2013 a crucial source of funding that subsequent mayors have been able to use to power their urban interventions.  \u201cSeveral entities were crucial for physical change in Medell\u00edn,\u201d Ortiz says. \u201cThe centralised agencies of the state, with their strategic city plans, and the semi-autonomous entities like the EDU and EPM, who had less accountability.\u201d But also key to Medell\u00edn\u2019s transformation was an attitude towards urbanism as a tool for promoting social mobility and equity \u2013 a process in which comuna dwellers became clients, participants and stakeholders in the city, with the chance to design their own destiny. This approach succeeded in crossing boundaries where political policy, social strategy, policing and corruption had previously failed. The city transformed itself by allowing the people to stitch it back together themselves.

Belardo (3.55) was unable to show his true quality last time at Sandown and could be a fair bet at 8-1 now that he is switched to a straight mile. Now four, Belardo achieved his career peak as a juvenile when landing the Dewhurst Stakes by two lengths from Kodi Bear, who is shorter than him in the betting for this. Perhaps unfairly, Belardo has been billed as a soft-ground horse for whom the drying ground at Newbury is not ideal. While he does not want the ground on the fast side, there should be easily enough juice in the turf here for him to express himself. He was out of form for most of last year but recovered to be a close second to Solow on Champions Day and resumed in fine fettle when scoring at Doncaster last month. He was given far too much to do when last seen at Sandown, when he did well to get within two lengths of the prominently ridden Toormore. Andrea Atzeni rides him here for the first time since the Dewhurst and will presumably be alive to the need to avoid a repeat of that. This looks competitive and lacking an outstanding performer. At 20-1 Euro Charline makes each-way appeal, having run a stormer to be second in the Dubai Turf at Meydan when last seen. 2.45 Newbury Eagle Top has by far the best form but it is nearly two years since he won anything and backing him at odds-on holds little appeal. David Simcock\u2019s progressive filly Carnachy looked very professional in landing a Listed prize at Goodwood last time and could be the one to make life hard for the favourite. 3.00 Newmarket Simcock has another bright chance with Desert Encounter, who seemed to be miles ahead of his rating when scoring on his handicap debut at Doncaster a fortnight ago. 3.20 Newbury The standout piece of form on offer here is Dream Dubai\u2019s second place in an Ascot Group Three last month. While he stayed on without threatening to win, he chased home Gifted Master, who has gone unbeaten for almost a year. The third horse went close at Listed level at York this week. 3.35 Newmarket The lightly raced Thikriyaat should have plenty more to offer and, although he is probably going to need further than this seven furlongs in time, he could get away with it here. The runner-up from his Newmarket win last month has since landed an Ascot handicap from a high mark. 4.10 Newmarket Soft ground may have been the undoing of Suqoor when he was sixth at this track last month. That flop has been bookended by two Polytrack wins and he could be a strong proposition once more, now that he gets to try fast turf. Chris Dwyer\u2019s horses continue in good form and he has a 26% strike-rate when using Silvestre De Sousa. 4.30 Newbury Ed Dunlop is another trainer who has started the year strongly and his Vivre Pour Vivre may make it three from three for 2016.

From what might have been the penultimate ball of the match Anderson fended a bouncer from Shaminda Eranga to Rangana Herath at backward short leg and Sri Lanka had won the series. Alastair Cook was subjected to fierce criticism, hanging on to the captaincy by a thread no thicker than that of a spider\u2019s web. Two years on the teams meet again in Leeds on Thursday for the start of a three-match series. Cook now seems unassailable as England\u2019s Test captain: Sangakkara is scoring runs for Surrey, having retired from international cricket; likewise Jayawardene, who has since coached England\u2019s batsmen, may be contemplating a T20 contract with Somerset. Sri Lanka are deemed to be a side in transition, an observation that can often be regarded as a bit of a euphemism. They are not expected to win. Even their own chief selector, Sanath Jayasuriya, has expressed concern about their batting strength. England, bearing the burden of being favourites, are therefore not reckoned to be \u201cin transition\u201d even though on Thursday Sri Lanka will probably have more survivors of the 2014 Headingley Test in their team than the hosts.   Related: Sri Lanka win second Test with one ball left to end England resistance    Two years ago Sam Robson, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Matt Prior, Chris Jordan and Liam Plunkett were in the England side. Five of them have been dropped and are, no doubt, eager to be recalled, while Prior has retired. Unlike Charlotte Edwards the above were dropped because they did not score enough runs or take enough wickets. In the recent World T20 Edwards averaged 50 (the next best was 27) and she scored her runs faster than anyone else in the team. Edwards was sacked because her peers are apparently dwarfed by her presence (she was told that the other players were \u201chiding\u201d behind her) and because she cannot run very fast. Hence she has had to retire primarily because of the frailties of her team and the fact that it was deemed impossible for anyone to captain a side with her in it. Edwards has taken an interesting decision gracefully. There is no hiding place for England\u2019s women now. In the men\u2019s game runs may be rather more important for survival but for the moment the selectors have stuck, not twisted. Alex Hales and Nick Compton have survived amid speculation that they might be replaced by some of the prodigious scorers of a run-drenched, rain-drenched season. However, neither has much credit in his Test account. The Sri Lanka attack is not reckoned to be among the best in the world \u2013 though that was a common observation last time just before they bowled England out a second time at Headingley \u2013 so a few plucky 30s may not be enough for this pair to remain in the side for the second half of the summer. There also remains the oddity that one of England\u2019s best batsmen, Jonny Bairstow, is currently residing at No7 in the order because he is also in possession of the wicketkeeping gloves. Jos Buttler returns from the IPL soon and if he can score runs against a red ball, assuming that he finds a place in a buoyant Lancashire side, there will be scope for a reshuffle with Bairstow higher in the order. Those batsmen selected for the Test, plus players such as Robson, Ballance and Bell, may have different ideas. Expect one debutant rather than two at Headingley. James Vince, the Hampshire captain, is earmarked to bat at five. He has a century to his name this summer against Yorkshire but more important for his selection was the favourable impression he made throughout the winter with the Lions in Dubai and the England T20 squad. Vince looks the part without having the most stunning figures in red-ball cricket. But then the same was true of a young Michael Vaughan, with whom he is often compared. Vince probably has more leeway than Hales and Compton. In these tolerant times the going rate for a new batsmen seems to be about seven Tests, far more generous than in the past. By the same token the bowling lineup will surely include all those who appeared in England\u2019s last Test in Cape Town. Steven Finn has lacked rhythm this summer \u2013 though his 12 wickets in five games for Middlesex compares favourably with Stuart Broad\u2019s five in three matches for Nottinghamshire. It will be a major surprise if Finn\u2019s place is taken by Jake Ball. Nonetheless the selection of Ball for the first time at this level is significant because it indicates that the pecking order among the pacemen is changing.", "title": "England\u2019s batting under scrutiny in first Test against Sri Lanka | Vic Marks", "sentences": ["He has a century to his name this summer against Yorkshire but more important for his selection was the favourable impression he made throughout the winter with the Lions in Dubai and the England T20 squad."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-14T21:00:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/jason-day-players-championship", "tags": ["Jason Day", "PGA Tour", "Golf", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "Rickie Fowler\u2019s surge towards the 2015 Players Championship title offered a scintillating storyline which will prove a regular source of reference.

Jason Day\u2019s triumph, his third of 2016, was never in doubt on this Florida afternoon. Maybe it was sealed from the moment the Australian signed for an opening round of 63. He joins his compatriots Steve Elkington, Greg Norman and Adam Scott in claiming the PGA Tour\u2019s marquee competition. For Day, who won by four shots, the plaudits keep on rolling in.

He\u2019s got that kind of unbeatable look about him.\u201d Yes, the Sunday atmosphere at Sawgrass was noticeably tame but that is to the credit of Day. He did not want to be embroiled in any kind of battle and duly was not. Day\u2019s grip on his world No1 ranking is now vice-like.

Three of those successes \u2013 the US PGA Championship, WGC Match Play and now the Players \u2013 have arrived in illustrious events. Day began Sunday with a four-shot lead. That halved, but very briefly, as the 28-year-old reached the turn in 38. He required a 12ft putt for bogey after regressing into the realms of a 12-handicapper when chipping around the green at the 9th. Day gathered his thoughts before making birdie at the 10th and collected further shots at the 12th and 16th to shoot 71 and win at 15 under. Kevin Chappell closed with a 69 for solo second, earning him spots in both the US Open and Open Championship. Justin Thomas, Matt Kuchar, Colt Knost and Ken Duke \u2013 the world No495 \u2013 shared third. Without being overly disrespectful, the calibre of player closest to Day during round four made matters even easier for him. McIlroy\u2019s Sunday hope was always a vain one. The four-times major champion played the front nine in 34 but stumbled on the turn for home, ending with a 70 for a seven-under-par aggregate and share of 12th. McIlroy was mid-air by the time Day collected the trophy; his charity foundation hosts the Irish Open at the K Club this week. \u201cThere\u2019s good stuff in there and there\u2019s too many wasted shots,\u201d said McIlroy, offering what has been a recurring sentiment. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I need to try and cut out going forward. \u201c I feel like I\u2019m playing good enough golf with the way I\u2019m hitting the shots to win tournaments and I haven\u2019t won a tournament this year.

It is about a businessman who came to the city in the early 1970s. He entered the court of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum and asked for a piece of land on which to build. The sheikh consented, and sent a surveyor to show the businessman the site. The following day, the businessman returned to court and declined the offer saying, as politely as he could, that he had expected a site much closer to the city centre. Months later, upon seeing how quickly Dubai had sprawled outwards, he returned to court and grovelled. He had failed to see the sheikh\u2019s magnanimity, he said, and wished to have the lot after all. The sheikh informed him that the original site was now already spoken for, but offered another in its place. Once again, the businessman was taken to the site, this one much further out than the original offer. He turned his face in disgust and never returned. The second piece of land was the site of the World Trade Centre.  Caught in a reverse telling of Tantalus, reaching for but never willing to pluck fruit from a bountiful tree, the businessman wasn\u2019t alone in scoffing at Dubai\u2019s future expansion. The city at the time seemed still focused on the hustle around the waters of what was known as Dubai Creek. When the World Trade Centre came along, it was often photographed as marooned in a distant patch of desert \u2013 a desert that somehow was also kind of swampy; there was a bad mosquito problem. The writer Jonathan Raban saw the tower as he entered the city from Abu Dhabi. He called it \u201csmug\u201d. Now the World Trade Centre is the gateway to the most memorable stretch of Dubai\u2019s Sheikh Zayed Road, or E11, lined by duelling skylines and the subject of endless gleaming photographs pitched to investors: two rows of skyscrapers, in fractious opposition, facing off across a 12-lane highway. With an exterior that is like a lattice made of ivory, the World Trade Centre is Sheikh Zayed Road\u2019s opening act \u2013 but for decades it stood as a signpost, a marker for where Dubai\u2019s development would eventually reach and surpass.      Dubai has long been an important port city for foreign traders. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/Shutterstock    Today it is magisterial, if also a little quaint. At 150m, its height barely qualifies it as a skyscraper. Up close you feel you could almost put your arms around it. When a new celebrity architect arrives in town, he is often asked what he (it\u2019s almost always a he) thinks of Dubai\u2019s architecture. If he is sensible enough to conjure up a compliment, he will express admiration for the World Trade Centre. It will become a hip place some day soon. For now, its meaning derives from another era.  In 1974, Dubai was a very different place than it is today. Oil had been discovered in the emirate only eight years previously, and the former trading town \u2013 which only saw its first asphalt road in 1960 \u2013 was rapidly growing into a modern city. Banks vied with international hotel chains for a view over the creek. Europeans, Arabs, North Americans and south Asians were arriving by plane and boat to profit from a city whose population had doubled in four years.     The World Trade Centre was an early version of the city-within-the-city. You could live, work and play there    And yet you could still watch wooden dhows from Pakistan, Iran and India shipping rice and canned goods, and residents still used the old souks for at least some of their shopping \u2013 asking a favourite tailor to copy this season\u2019s London fashions, for example, or getting a radio repaired. Traffic was becoming unbearable. Dubai\u2019s wealthier residents had begun to catch suburban fever, and city officials claimed the city needed to quadruple in size to meet demand. The Financial Times grumbled that Dubai was \u201ca city under strain\u201d. Western expatriates were known to complain of \u201chissing empty taps, the blackouts, and the telex breakdowns\u201d. Sheikh Rashid \u2013 who the British press liked to call the \u201cmerchant prince\u201d and had travelled to enough financial capitals to witness the ongoing merging of business with leisure \u2013 commissioned his trusted architect, John Harris, to design an exhibition centre for trade fairs. Within a few months, Harris returned with a campus of six-storey buildings. Rashid demanded a tower, and Harris \u2013 who had entered with a proposal for an exhibition centre \u2013 left the meeting with the mandate to design a \u201cWorld Trade Centre\u201d, a de facto franchise of the now world-famous brand.     Sheikh Zayed Road viewed from the 154th floor of the Burj Khalifa, currently the world\u2019s tallest building. Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images    He dutifully visited the ones in New York and in Tokyo, and set about building a 33-storey giant, by the far the tallest building in Dubai at the time. Halfway into construction, Sheikh Rashid insisted it be taller. It eventually topped out at the equivalent of 39 storeys. If a skyscraper helps convince the world your city is for real, the World Trade Centre convinced Dubai that it was open for business. The complex included all the elements supposedly needed by a global city: a luxury hotel, three towers of expensive apartments, an exhibition centre, a parking garage, tennis courts. You came in from the desert via a ramp, arriving at a raised entrance that kept sand off the marble floors and emphasised how the World Trade Centre was leaving the old ways behind: the city was going inside. Twenty-four hour management, security guards, a businessman\u2019s club, a travel agency, a post office, a cinema, all of it promised smooth commercial transactions. Air-conditioning no longer meant a boxy unit hanging out of the window, but a temperature-controlled environment where it was always 22C. The World Trade Centre was an early version of the city-within-the-city. You could live, work and play there. And every interior space \u2013 not to mention the \u201coasis\u201d gardens \u2013 was carefully calculated into your management fees. The floor of the exhibition centre itself was modular \u2013 it could become an ice-skating rink or a boxing ring with stadium seating.  Recreation merged smoothly into work. Marketing consultants suggested a mezzanine lounge with a \u201crich Middle Eastern decor [and] free coffee\u201d. Shared spaces offered \u201cdesks, local telephones, news service tickers, and notice boards \u2026 [to] help visitors adjust to unfamiliar surroundings\u201d. Sheikh Rashid\u2019s advisers stressed to Harris \u201cthe importance of amenity and recreation \u2026 in the interest of trade\u201d.      Dubai\u2019s economy was based on revenues from trade until oil was discovered in 1966. Photograph: Paul Popper/Popperfoto/Getty Images    The Hilton, meanwhile, offered minibars and room service \u2013 standard today, but at the time businessmen were known to arrive in Dubai to discover that they had reserved not a room, but a bed in a room. Stories abound of British purveyors and consultants arriving to drum up business in the 1960s and 1970s and having to sleep on stoops and freshen up in a public men\u2019s room before the pitch meeting the next day. With the opening of the World Trade Centre, there was now a temporary glut of high-end rooms. Dubai\u2019s global businessmen could eat Maine lobster, chilled on ice. The complex even ran on its own power plant.  It was also an operating city, especially when the 500 luxury apartments \u2013 furnished by the Hilton \u2013 opened next door, allowing you to live like a guest who pays for his own hospitality. Owned by Dubai\u2019s ruler, the entire complex was meant to function independently from the rest of the city. The sheikh even owned the management company whose marketing campaigns in British newspapers pitched the superstructure as the \u201cnatural centre\u201d of the Arab world.  But if the complex functioned as its own city, it wasn\u2019t abandoned outside the rest of the city. It was connected, by Dubai\u2019s largest roundabout, to the vast staging site for Port Rashid, a 15-year building project. Between the tower and the port lay Quonset huts and temporary warehouses, mounds of earth, tents and sheds assembled for labourers, forgotten debris from earlier phases of construction; all of it manned by a small army of south Asian men wearing loose-fitting clothes and sandals. The World Trade Centre offered a sky box to watch the show. From the windows of the tower, it was apparent that Dubai\u2019s ruler was taking modernisation away from the existing city. The old Dubai Creek \u2013 the existing centre of the city that the apocryphal businessman wanted so badly \u2013 had vanished behind a cloud of construction dust.     The Dubai World Trade Centre in 1999. Photograph: Rabih Moghrabi/AFP/Getty Images    Cordoned off from the rest of the city, Dubai\u2019s most modern tower and port were the testing ground for a new kind of urbanism: for the first time, large tracts of land were being disengaged from the city. Urbanisation was now linked to the non-urban. One might reduce the World Trade Centre \u2013 at the time, the tallest building in the Middle East \u2013 to an early example of Dubai\u2019s pursuit of superlatives, which in the subsequent decades of the Burj Khalifa and Palm Jumeirah would reach such a frenzy of hubris and, eventually, spectacular debt-saddled collapse. But that would miss the fact that the tower was a message: a restrained, cost-efficient facade that \u201cincorporated an Islamic character\u201d in its pointed arches, but radiated the international signs of a place of business. The radio spire on the pinnacle made the World Trade Centre seem to be receiving and sending signals to other confluences of financial power. The sheikh bought advertising space in the Times and Financial Times, not just to sell space in the building, but also to sell Dubai to the world.   Related: Story of cities #27: Singapore \u2013 the most meticulously planned city in the world    One way he sold it was to stress its \u201cBritish-built quality\u201d. Historically, Dubai\u2019s development had always relied on mastering trade routes, acting as a hub for hardwood, steel, food, labour. The World Trade Centre, on the other hand, was about just one connection: Dubai\u2019s access to British design and engineering. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, glass, aluminium fittings and kitchen appliances were all manufactured in Britain and shipped into Port Rashid. Press releases reassured that British engineers were even overseeing the mixing of concrete. The only major part of the building that wasn\u2019t British were the people who assembled it: mostly from Pakistan, living temporarily in barracks at the tower\u2019s base. In 1981, Margaret Thatcher, on a visit to sell arms to Abu Dhabi, made a brief stop in Dubai. Sheikh Rashid took her to the top of his tower. They squinted out at the newest development, Port Jebel Ali, the world\u2019s largest manmade port, newly operational 30km away, another example of British engineers and financiers delivering the infrastructure that would help ensure Dubai\u2019s global ascendancy.  Peering outward, Thatcher could see the thin line of asphalt stretch away from the tower and vanish. That asphalt would later swell to become what is today\u2019s Sheikh Zayed Road. At the time, city officials didn\u2019t yet know how it was going to supply the 23 million gallons of water it would need to keep its citizens hydrated daily. A convincing, singular tower would do its part to trumpet Dubai\u2019s viability, and secure its future line of credit.

Thanks Memphis Depay Signed for \u00a325m in the summer to inject Manchester United\u2019s left wing with pace and incision, the Dutchman has done little to justify either the price tag or the No7 on the back of his shirt. It started reasonably well: two goals against Club Brugge in the Champions League, followed by another against his old club PSV, suggested he could continue the form that led to him scoring 22 goals in 30 league matches in the Netherlands. But two Premier League goals in 16 starts has meant he is rarely now named in the starting lineup. Often underwhelming, frequently a liability \u2013 the back-header to David de Gea which gifted Stoke their opening goal in their 2-0 win, for example \u2013 he has been put in the shade by Anthony Martial and the emergence of Marcus Rashford. Paul Scholes has urged for Depay to be given another season at the club, but he will have to step up if he is to justify it. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi Raheem Sterling\u2019s form might have garnered more attention than his Manchester City team-mate Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, but the defender has struggled more than the forward. Compare Sterling\u2019s season to, say, a success story like Martial and it suggests he has not been quite the flop it has been assumed. He and Martial were signed for similarly exorbitant fees (\u00a349m for the former, \u00a358.8m for the latter), are similar ages (21 and 20) and are broadly comparable in most pass completion, assist and key passes stats this season. Martial has 11 league goals to Sterling\u2019s six, but has often been played as a striker while Sterling has not. Instead, leaving aside the performance of Yaya Tour\u00e9 this season, it is Otamendi who has most disappointed at Manchester City. In a season in which Vincent Kompany has frequently been absent with injury, Otamendi has entirely failed to step into the breach or live up to his \u00a334m fee. Outpaced, outclassed and outplayed, he has never looked like touching the form he showed at Valencia.     Manchester City\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi signed for \u00a334m in August 2015. Photograph: Matthew Ashton - AMA/Getty Images    Cesc F\u00e0bregas Last season, Cesc F\u00e0bregas topped the stats charts for touches of the ball and assists, making him a vital component in Chelsea\u2019s title win. This season, he has been a shadow of his former self. Signed in 2014 ostensibly as a replacement for Frank Lampard, F\u00e0bregas lacked his predecessor\u2019s dynamism but had far greater creativity. Last season, the dominant Nemanja Matic and hard-working Oscar provided the energy F\u00e0bregas lacked in midfield, allowing the playmaker time and space to pick out passes. This season, Matic has lumbered, Oscar has been erratic or absent, and Mikel John Obi has been inconsistent, putting pressure on F\u00e0bregas to work harder in defence and pick passes more quickly in attack. Neither suits his game. He has not been helped by Diego Costa\u2019s attitude up front. The striker found arguments with defenders more regularly than space in between them, making F\u00e0bregas\u2019s job as his goal-butler harder. His decline in form in the build-up to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s sacking meant Chelsea fans made him a scapegoat for the dismissal of a favourite manager and the crowd\u2019s reaction to his presence on the pitch cannot have helped his game.     Cesc F\u00e0bregas was brought in to fill the hole left in Chelsea\u2019s midfield by Frank Lampard. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock    Eden Hazard Alongside F\u00e0bregas and Costa, Eden Hazard was the other \u201crat\u201d fingered by Chelsea fans post-Mourinho. Certainly Hazard and Mourinho have come to blows in the past, but, under the Portuguese in 2014-15, the Belgian still put in his best season, winning the PFA and Football Writers\u2019 Player of the Year as well as being named Chelsea\u2019s player of the year for the second season in a row. Though Pedro has underwhelmed, Falcao has been scandalous, and Costa has struggled, Hazard has been by far the most disappointing of Chelsea\u2019s attackers this season. A hip and thigh injury have not helped, but Hazard\u2019s displays have been strangely impotent, the fizz and pace his game relies on lacking. It took him nearly a year to follow his strike against Crystal Palace in May 2015 with another Premier League goal (against Southampton at the end of April) and though he has picked up in the final games of the season, his impressive performance from the bench during the fiery Chelsea v Tottenham match in May served only to remind what has been missing.     Eden Hazard was the 2014-15 PFA Player of the Year. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian    Gabriel Agbonlahor Christian Benteke has been rotten for Liverpool, Seydou Doumbia dire for Newcastle, but Gabriel Agbonlahor has been the epitome of Aston Villa\u2019s dreadful season. Despite being the club\u2019s captain and an influential voice in the dressing room, the striker allowed himself to become so unfit he could not be selected, having already faced a club investigation for being pictured smoking a shisha pipe on holiday in Dubai. His return of one goal in 18 appearances in all competitions is bad enough, but for him to finish the season training in the reserves, having quit the captaincy and with the side relegated, makes him pretty much the personification of the Randy Lerner era at Aston Villa: potential and power left to waste by neglect.     Gabriel Agbonlahor has spent plenty of time on the bench this season.

Not in 2005 when facing Andriy Shevchenko\u2019s penalty nor in January when competing in the Dubai 24 Hour race in his current guise as a professional driver, but when Liverpool were adrift under Brendan Rodgers this season while J\u00fcrgen Klopp was improving his tennis. Without interrupting the former Borussia Dortmund coach\u2019s sabbatical, Dudek feared his old club would remain on the margins. Thanks to the fact they did make the call to Klopp, the former goalkeeper expects his status as the last man to secure a European trophy for Liverpool to end on Wednesday. \u201cThe club needs new legends,\u201d he states. Dudek hopes to attend the Europa League final against Sevilla, St Jakob-Park\u2019s capacity notwithstanding, and to see Klopp guide Liverpool to their first European title since his save from Shevchenko completed the Champions League comeback against Milan 11 years ago. It did not require a leap of faith for Dudek to covet the charismatic German as the man to revive his former club but the 43-year-old\u2019s conviction was based on inside knowledge. Conversations with Polish compatriots who played for Klopp at Dortmund fuelled the anticipation. \u201cI was scared to be honest,\u201d the former Poland international admits. \u201cI don\u2019t wish bad for anyone but I was scared Liverpool would miss out on Klopp. I knew he had the right mentality because I had spoken to [Robert] Lewandowski, [Lukasz] Piszczek and [Jakob] Blaszczykowski and they all said his mentality with the players, transmission to the supporters and knowledge of the game is so good. This is the right man for this club. I was scared maybe someone like Arsenal would take him before us.   Related: J\u00fcrgen Klopp has Liverpool united behind him for Europa League final    \u201cHe needs time, of course, but he deserves a lot of credit because a lot of managers are the same. They sign a contract and the first thing they do is sign 10 players. What he did was say: \u2018I\u2019ll sign nobody, I\u2019ll give you a chance, you are good players, let me see.\u2019 He will need to sign new players this summer to increase motivation and competition but he has shown a fantastic example.\u201d Dudek, who was speaking at the launch of his autobiography, A Big Pole in Our Goal, witnessed Klopp\u2019s impact after travelling from his home in Krakow to attend the semi-final second leg victory over Villarreal at Anfield. Lewandowski\u2019s words about his former manager struck home that night. He recalls: \u201cLewandowski said he is a guy who you never know is speaking seriously or speaking with love. Sometimes he can kill you on the pitch and then a few seconds later he is giving you a hug. Direction is important. He\u2019ll scare you and then maybe he\u2019ll tell you he said too much and gives you a hug. \u201cHe stirs emotions and that is why the players are so focused. You never know when he is going to shout. You need to be focused because he is involved in every single moment. Lewandowski said that if Klopp sees someone switch off in training, even if that player is not in the team, he will go over and kill him. If the person gets upset he will say: \u2018OK man, no problem, but don\u2019t forget I am watching you.\u2019 You have to be very focused to work for him. \u201cHe gets everyone engaged. You see the passion and enthusiasm he has stirred in the supporters. Ten minutes before the end of the Villarreal game Lovren made a tackle. Klopp didn\u2019t see the reaction he wanted from the people and he turned around to the crowd and said: \u2018Come on, cheer him.\u2019 He wants you to fight for him.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s quarter-final comeback against Dortmund provided clear evidence of fighting spirit under Klopp, and invited comparisons with the game that secured Dudek a place in Anfield folklore. The Liverpool manager evoked memories of Istanbul at half-time in the second leg, with his team trailing 2-0 and then 3-1 before sealing an unforgettable victory in stoppage time. There is no mistaking Dudek\u2019s pride at providing a helping hand after 11 years, but he knows it is imperative that the momentum from beating Manchester United, Dortmund and Villarreal is not squandered against Sevilla.   Related: Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson could make Europa League final against Sevilla    \u201cIt is fantastic that Istanbul can be some kind of motivation,\u201d he says. \u201cI go to many supporters\u2019 club meetings in Poland and people are always asking me about it because what happened serves as an example for life as well. One touch, one thing, can change your life. You try, you fight and it is difficult, but then one moments changes it all. At half-time in Istanbul, we are losing 3-0 but some of the guys said we have waited for this moment for so many years so we have to fight, create an atmosphere and hopefully create a party. And Liverpool is the best at parties. \u201cBut Liverpool needs new legends, new people. There is a new generation in the stands and the kids want to see new heroes. Their fathers know the generation of 2005 and they ask me if I remember them from waiting on the gate at Melwood. Not much. They were little then and now they are a big guy 11 years later. You need new generations to keep going with the belief. The team changed its history three times on the way to the final, it cannot drop it now. \u201cThey\u2019ve put so much energy in against Manchester United, Borussia Dortmund and Villarreal, don\u2019t waste it. To win the trophy changes your life completely. Maybe it\u2019s different with the Champions League but with any trophy you can be remembered forever. If I walk down the street in Rotterdam [he played for Feyenoord for five years] they just say hello. Here [in Liverpool] there is the most enthusiasm. My message is \u2018write your own history\u2019. Write it down for yourself.\u201d Dudek retired from the game in 2011, following four years as backup to Iker Casillas at Real Madrid, but not from a sporting life. He has appeared three times at the amateur world golf championship, playing off a handicap of four, and Audi\u2019s sponsorship of Real opened up a route into racing cars professionally via an ambassadorial role for Castrol. \u201cIn January I took part in the 24 Hour race in Dubai, which is massive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was also shocking. Our car was only 340 horse power and there were other cars of 700-800hp flying everywhere.\u201d He has also found time to set up a sports academy for 400 children in Poland. \u201cIt\u2019s not commercial, we engage sponsors,\u201d Dudek explains. \u201cIn my time I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to play football if I\u2019d had to pay for it. Football used to be very cheap, you had to pay for nothing. Now you have to pay for the clothes, for boots, for coaches, for training camps, for everything.\u201d As for Wednesday in Basel, the former Liverpool goalkeeper hopes to find parallels between his own trials and redemption at Anfield with that of current keeper Simon Mignolet, who he often texts with messages of support. \u201cI thought he was going to win the [Capital One] cup against Manchester City three months ago,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be nice for him and for his confidence if it happened now. I think he deserves a little bit more. They criticise him but the team played badly. He had a fantastic season, Liverpool almost won the League Cup, but they conceded the same amount of goals last season (48 in the 2014-15 Premier League season, 50 in 2013-14). The problem was they didn\u2019t score as many goals. With one game to go either he stays or goes, but he can write the story himself.\u201d", "title": "Jerzy Dudek: \u2018Liverpool need new heroes \u2013 Europa League final can create them\u2019", "sentences": ["Not in 2005 when facing Andriy Shevchenko\u2019s penalty nor in January when competing in the Dubai 24 Hour race in his current guise as a professional driver, but when Liverpool were adrift under Brendan Rodgers this season while J\u00fcrgen Klopp was improving his tennis.", "\u201cIn January I took part in the 24 Hour race in Dubai, which is massive,\u201d he says."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-16T21:30:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/17/tom-mckibbin-golf-prodigy-rory-mcilroy", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "Martin O\u2019Neill may not be averse to abbreviating media duties but the decision to do so at an awards dinner in Belfast held a deeper meaning.

I hope to see a lot more of Tom in the future.\u201d On Wednesday, after an invite from the Rory Foundation, which is hosting the tournament, McKibbin will rub shoulders with some of golf\u2019s leading lights when participating in the Irish Open pro-am. From McIlroy, this was a wonderful touch; for the schoolboy, it is cause for huge excitement. The pair have played together in Florida, with McKibbin also inside the ropes during a warm-up day for the recent WGC Match Play Championship, gaining valuable advice from his illustrious compatriot. McIlroy clearly has more immediate aspirations but a positive legacy for golf in his home country would be highly pertinent. There are already signs of exactly that.     Tom McKibbin with Rory McIlroy. Like the multiple major winner, McKibbin has also learned his trade at the Holywood club in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Courtesy of Sara Cupples    One of several intriguing aspects of McKibbin\u2019s journey is that the US has formed such a consistent backdrop. \u201cThere are a lot more players over there, things are a lot more competitive over there,\u201d he says. \u201cI have played tournaments in America for longer than I have here because for a while there was nothing for my age group. I was always playing with older kids.\u201d Competitive matters had started closer to home, at Portmarnock, where a nine-year\u2011old McKibbin won a qualifier for the European championships. He hasn\u2019t looked back since. Johnny Foster, a widely respected coach in Northern Ireland, has overseen McKibbin\u2019s development from the age of seven. Only weeks earlier, upon a first visit to the driving range, a friend\u2019s father had noticed Tom\u2019s natural skillset. Now, Tom has a fitness programme aimed at injury prevention which he partakes in four times a week. \u201cTom is a tremendous student,\u201d says Foster. \u201cHe puts time and effort into things. His attitude is his greatest strength. He just seems to be in love with golf. I literally had a blank canvas at the start and the fact he started very early meant he didn\u2019t come with bad habits. He has now travelled a lot outside of Ireland so he realises the world is a lot bigger than just being the best guy at your golf club or in your area. \u201cIt is great when he wins and super for his confidence but I\u2019m more interested in whether he is learning. People turn the corner somewhere around late high school, early college, when the focus starts going on results. At Tom\u2019s stage it is about development; as a person, concepts of the game and life, so that when turbulence comes \u2013 and it will \u2013 he deals with it and sees it as part of his journey. If Tom enjoys it, he will stick at it and if he sticks at it, he will be successful.\u201d Given the geographical background, Foster is also well placed to pinpoint a McIlroy effect. It is clearly visible at Holywood, where 50 children of varying abilities will routinely take part in a junior medal tournament. \u201cKids are more involved now in robust coaching and competitive programmes,\u201d Foster says. \u201cRory makes golf look cool and is a tremendous ambassador; young, healthy, swing looks great. \u201c When he does something it shines a light; getting in good shape, so kids want to eat better, for example. He is a real standard bearer and that\u2019s brilliant for us in a small country. I see more kids taking up golf as their No1 sport.\u201d There is, of course, inherent danger attached to the placing of a spotlight on one so young. Promise often isn\u2019t replicated by reality, throughout sport. Where McKibbin benefits \u2013 coaching aside \u2013 is from grounded parents, Sara and Robin, and a considerate school, Belfast Royal Academy. \u201cIt is trying to find that balance between trying to keep normality and trying to let Tom achieve what he wants to achieve,\u201d Sara says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t miss an awful lot of school. Anything we try to let him compete in or think he should compete in, we try to make sure they are holidays or next to holidays so that he only misses a couple of days here and there. It has always been very clear to Tom; if the schoolwork isn\u2019t done, golf won\u2019t happen. \u201cThe school has been really supportive. We have a different balance between sport and academic work. The school recognised that Tom had already done rugby etc, he is multi-skilled, he is sociable so they exchanged the likes of football and rugby time for golf. \u201cThe only worry I have with attention is that it doesn\u2019t put too much pressure on him. But at the same time, there is nothing better than life experience and Tom is doing things none of us did when we were kids. Why shouldn\u2019t he enjoy it and soak it up?\u201d This journey has been as much of an eye-opener for mother and father as Tom himself, with the funding of trips across the Atlantic an obvious challenge. Robin previously took on jobs in Dubai and Afghanistan. \u201cGolf itself isn\u2019t expensive,\u201d Sara adds. \u201cFolk think it is an expensive hobby. Junior memberships are so reasonable. Tom\u2019s first one was \u00a380; he was there every day. Even the equipment at that stage is reasonable. \u201cThe travel can create huge pressure but the experience of going to these places is important to him because this is what he wants to do. I didn\u2019t know a good or bad golf shot when he started out but I could see his drive, obsession almost, right away.\u201d That obsession has led to a handicap of five at home and scratch in the US, and McKibbin has his sights firmly set on the Future Masters in 2016. Last year, he opened that tournament with a 65 with the follow-up of 73 and 76 \u201conly\u201d good enough for an eighth-placed finish. Beyond the Future Masters in Alabama in June, McKibbin has a landmark aim: \u201cThe Masters,\u201d he says with a smile.

The reality couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. This faceted box is the new Palestinian Museum, a $24m (\u00a316.6m) container for celebrating the history, culture and society of the oppressed nation, finally inaugurated on Wednesday after a 20-year gestation \u2013 with nothing inside it.    The building emerges from the landscape like a stealthy bunker in bright white Bethlehem limestone    \u201cWe thought it was better to celebrate the collective achievement of completing the building than delay any longer,\u201d says Omar Al-Qattan of the Welfare Association (Taawon), an NGO backed mainly by Palestinian exiles, which funded the project. \u201cPositive energy is important in our current climate of cynicism and indecision, in a country that\u2019s under occupation, where there\u2019s little self-value or self-confidence. We wanted to make a statement that we\u2019re here to stay.\u201d Designed by Dublin-based architects Heneghan Peng, who won the project in an international competition in 2011, the building emerges from the landscape like a stealthy bunker, zig-zagging along the contours of the rocky site in precisely hewn planes of bright white Bethlehem limestone. Set at the top of a four-hectare plot, donated by the neighbouring Birzeit University, the angular form casts ripples into the surrounding land, giving on to a sunken amphitheatre and a garden of snaking terraces, planted with a cornucopia of native species that reads like a horticultural history of Palestine.

Photograph: Oliver Wainwright    There are groves of almond and apricot, pomegranate and mulberry, followed by walnut, carob, fig and terebinth, ending with a blurry edge of pine and oak as the garden dissolves into the valley. Walking up the winding path, you get wafts of mint and sage, lavender and rosemary, before reaching the blinding terrace of the museum, where the stone facade lifts up like a curtain to draw you into the shady air-conditioned halls within. The building has a powerful presence, at once defensive and welcoming, robust and permeable, channelling a sense of the region without resorting to the Islamic pastiche of pointed arches and turrets favoured by the nearby university campus. A sequence of spaces that somehow evoke the dense urban forms of Palestinian towns squeeze you through narrow passages and tapering stairs, opening out into lofty halls where the angular geometry soars skywards. At just 3,500 square metres, it is a relatively compact place, with one main exhibition hall, a couple of educational spaces and a small cafe. Nor will there be much to see when the museum opens to the public on 1 June. The institution\u2019s founding director, Jack Persekian, resigned last year over artistic differences with the board and his opening show has been cancelled. The museum\u2019s new director, Dr Mahmoud Hawari, comes from the University of Oxford\u2019s Khalili Research Centre and is leaving a post at the British Museum to develop a more research-based programme here. Although his team will be acquiring some artefacts, building a collection is not the priority. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to collect the most valuable Palestinian things in one place, only to have them subject to harassment or confiscation by the Israelis,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is definitely not a repository of national patrimony,\u201d adds Al-Qattan.

Initially conceived in 1997 as a memorial for the 50th anniversary of the Nakba (the exodus that saw 700,000 Palestinians expelled from their homes in 1948), the institution has since evolved into a more symbolic hub for the international diaspora, which now numbers around six million people around the world. \u201cGiven all the travel restrictions, not many people will actually be able to come here,\u201d admits Al-Qattan. Instead, an extensive online archive will supplement the programme on site. \u201cWe see this place as a mothership with various satellites.\u201d There are outposts planned in Amman, Santiago de Chile, Michigan and Beirut, where the first exhibition, At the Seams: A Political History of Palestinian Embroidery, opens in June. This international mix was reflected in the construction itself. The glass curtain wall was trucked across the deserts of Saudi Arabia from Dubai, in a procession recalling an ancient caravan, while other imports from Europe were subject to lengthy delays or refusals at the border due to Israeli regulations.  \u201cWe had so many headaches,\u201d says Feras Tubaila, one of the main contractors responsible for what aims to be Palestine\u2019s first LEED-certified green building \u2013 quite a feat in a context where most buildings have neither heating nor insulation. Austrian fire exit signs were rejected by the Israeli authorities, an English waterproofing system mysteriously doubled in price on import, while an Israeli supplier had to be smuggled on to site in secret to install a sliding door. The Jordanian landscape architect still hasn\u2019t managed to get a visa to come here. \u201cFaceTime meetings have been invaluable,\u201d says architect R\u00f3is\u00edn Heneghan. \u201cThankfully, the Wi-Fi stretches to the garden.\u201d The Dublin practice are no strangers to working in hairy contexts. They won the competition for the Grand Egyptian Museum, near the pyramids in Giza, in 2003, a gargantuan project that started construction shortly before the country descended into revolution. They were then then selected to design a new National Centre for Contemporary Art in Moscow, shortly before Russia invaded the Ukraine. Their recent appointment to build the Canadian Canoe Museum in Ontario makes you worry for the welfare of the country\u2019s paddlers. In the West Bank, however, their hilltop beacon beams optimism, an affirmative symbol that grows out of the land itself.

Moving to Berlin as a Syrian refugee, he knew nothing about the tech scene or how valuable developers like him were in the city. \u201cI wanted to work,\u201d says Shaker. \u201cBut the job centre told me: \u2018If you can\u2019t speak German, you can\u2019t get a job\u2019.\u201d The country sees language as key to refugee integration: last month, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, introduced mandatory German lessons in exchange for financial support. Shaker reluctantly put his career on hold while he learned the language,and found part-time work in a call centre that needed Arabic speakers.     Hussein Shaker, community manager and co-founder of MigrantHire. Photograph: Me Chuthai/ KaterDemos    \u201cIt was so boring,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I had good technical experience but I thought I couldn\u2019t get a job in the industry because of my German.\u201d That was before a colleague introduced him to Remi Mekki, a Norwegian entrepreneur living in Berlin. Mekki told him that tech companies in the city were so desperate for developers, they didn\u2019t care whether employees could speak German. \u201cEveryone can speak English,\u201d said Mekki. The pair decided to tackle refugee unemployment together, co-founding the recruitment platform MigrantHire with two other Berliners.  To register with MigrantHire, refugees upload their CV \u2013 in English, German or Arabic. The platform\u2019s six-person team does everything else. They iron out legal issues, help refugees get permission to work and prepare them for interviews. During the current pilot phase, MigrantHire has been approached by employers but it also seeks out vacancies that match refugees\u2019 experience, charging a success fee when developers are hired. In 2015, 1.1 million refugees arrived in Germany. Now the country faces the mammoth task of integrating them into the labour market. Although there are jobs \u2013 there were an estimated 43,000 unfilled vacancies in the German IT industry last year \u2013 many new arrivals are still struggling to find work. Since January, Mekki and Shaker have channelled their efforts into finding jobs in Berlin\u2019s vibrant tech scene for refugees with IT experience. According to data in the 2015 Global Startup Ecosystem (pdf) report, Berlin is home to between 1,800 and 3,000 active tech startups. For English-speaking refugees, the IT sector can offer a shortcut into the labour market as many offices work internationally and don\u2019t require employees to speak German. Music-streaming service Soundcloud and the mapping business Here (owned by BMW, Mercedes and Audi), for example, use English as their office language in Berlin. Despite 10 years of IT experience in Damascus and Dubai, web developer Bashar Alghazouly spent nearly two years looking for work unsuccessfully. The softly spoken Syrian blames his German. \u201cMy language is still very bad,\u201d he says.  However, once Alghazouly discovered MigrantHire, he had three interviews in three months. The platform focused on finding him web developer positions in English-speaking offices. Now Alghazouly is one of MigrantHire\u2019s two success stories. Last week, he was offered a job at software vendor Signavio. MigrantHire has ambitious plans for an organisation yet to formally launch. It aims to get 10,000 refugees into jobs by 2017. But concedes that to have any chance of doing this it needs to change the way it works. \u201cWe discovered that doing the whole process yourself takes too much time\u201d, says Mekki. \u201cGetting refugee candidates and employers on board, finding the match, preparing candidates for the interview, following up with the company.\u201d  He adds: \u201cWe\u2019re nerds. Software is our strength but we\u2019re no good at HR.\u201d Instead, the company is looking to form partnerships with other refugee recruiters that specialiee in matchmaking and is in talks with Connecteer and Work for Refugees. Under the new system, MigrantHire would focus on creating a scalable platform and encouraging sign-ups, while its partners would match refugees to jobs, help them with applications and set the fee for employers. To reach its target of 10,000 jobs, the team will also broaden its focus from refugees with IT experience to skilled and unskilled refugees from all professions.  But Dr Carola Burket of the Nuremberg-based Institute for Employment Research is wary about MigrantHire\u2019s reliance on using English-speaking jobs as a model for integration. She says: \u201cMaybe one or two [refugees] might find a job in an English-speaking environment in Germany but not the majority. We are talking about 600,000 people who we have to integrate into the labour market. It\u2019s not going to be possible to find English-speaking jobs for all of them.\u201d  For the project to work she believes that \u201cMigrantHire needs a strong partner like the Federal Ministry of Labour or the Federal Employment Agency, and it needs to increase its publicity\u201d.", "title": "The Syrian who's aiming to get refugees jobs in Berlin's booming tech scene", "sentences": ["Despite 10 years of IT experience in Damascus and Dubai, web developer Bashar Alghazouly spent nearly two years looking for work unsuccessfully."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-18T11:01:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/18/rory-mcilroy-frustrated-negative-spin-2016", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "European Tour", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Crisis, what crisis?

At the WGC Match Play Championship he was defeated in the semi-final. Context is, of course, everything.

For once it was not the noise of his alarm clock that stirred him, but the sound of pouring rain outside \u2013 and a room flooded to the level of his bed. Duarte lived in Las Tunas, a working-class neighbourhood 35km north-west of Argentina\u2019s capital, Buenos Aires. Running through the centre of the neighbourhood is the arroyo Las Tunas, a small creek. Though the arroyo had flooded before, it had never been this severe. Panicked, Duarte waded out of his room. Outside, the rest of his family were desperately trying to salvage what few possessions they could before leaving the house. A neighbour banged on their front door: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get down to the wall,\u201d he called out. \u201cWe\u2019re tearing it down.\u201d The wall in question was a 10-ft tall concrete structure which separated working-class Las Tunas from Nordelta, the richest and best-known gated community in Buenos Aires. Walls like this have become a fact of life for many in the city\u2019s suburbs. Tearing it down was the only hope Las Tunas had for keeping the floodwaters from rising any further. Concrete walls Las Tunas was originally settled in the 1960s after new factories had sprung up in the area \u2013 encouraged by the numerous railroads connecting the area with the port of Buenos Aires, and the completion of the nearby Pan-American highway.     Residents sit on a bench at a flooded public square after a rainstorm in Buenos Aires in 2013. Photograph: Enrique Marcarian/Reuters    Las Tunas grew to house workers at these factories. By the 1990s, rising prices in central Buenos Aires would turn it into a \u201cbedroom community\u201d for blue-collar workers commuting to the centre of town as well. The population swelled, and Las Tunas is still one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the Buenos Aires suburb of Tigre. Las Tunas also remains solidly working class. It\u2019s not completely destitute: walk through the neighbourhood and you will encounter a handful of well-kept homes with new compact Fiats parked out front.    A new kind of neighbourhood appeared that would make these dreams come true: the gated community    But the sidewalks are often littered with piles of dirt and debris, and the flow of traffic on the streets is occasionally punctuated by the clip-clop of horse-drawn carts, driven by cartoneros seeking rubbish that they might be able to resell for a few pesos. The lack of running water and sewers means that every so often, people walking by catch a whiff of something unpleasant. On the other side of the concrete wall that rises abruptly on the north-west side of Las Tunas, however, things could hardly look more different. In the early 1900s, Argentina\u2019s commodity boom made it famous as a destination for immigrants with big dreams. Decades of economic instability would delay those dreams, but they never died. And in the 1960s, a new kind of neighbourhood appeared on the outskirts of Buenos Aires that would finally make these dreams come true: the gated community. The capital\u2019s suburbs presented a challenge: electricity and running water services were scarce, access to the city centre was difficult, and law enforcement was lax. When the new freeways of the 1960s effectively solved the transportation issue, private developers stepped in with a recipe that would make the city\u2019s suburban dreams possible: new neighbourhoods built from scratch, with privately run water and power grids, private security forces, and high perimeter walls. These new neighbourhoods were dubbed \u201ccountry clubs\u201d \u2013 later shortened simply to \u201ccountries\u201d.     A new building complex at Nordelta \u2013 conceived as a kind of part-Venice, part-Dubai, part-Anytown US. Photograph: Enrique Marcarian/Reuters    The number of \u201ccountries\u201d expanded steadily through the 1970s and 80s, then exploded in the 1990s. This development set the stage for Nordelta, which would take the concept to a new level; instead of being \u201cjust\u201d another gated community, this would be an entire city built within concrete walls. Nordelta was the brainchild of Eduardo Costantini. The Argentine real estate developer keeps a low profile; when asked about Nordelta, he generally prefers to change the subject to his art museum, the Museum of Latin American Art, in Buenos Aires\u2019s Palermo neighbourhood. Recently one of his other creations, a circular bridge in Uruguay\u2019s Punta del Este, garnered him international attention. Costantini conceived of the idea of Nordelta in 1992: it was to be part-Venice, part-Dubai, part-Anytown US. Luxury townhouses would be built on top of artificial islands surrounded by carefully sculpted lagoons. Families would be able to take their children to private schools, private health facilities and private recreation centres, all without leaving the development\u2019s gates. Though construction took longer than expected and Nordelta opened piecemeal, starting in the late 1990s, it soon became an overwhelming success. Perhaps just as significant are the changes Nordelta and other such communities have brought outside their walls. The area has become a surreal landscape of railroads, factories, working-class areas such as Las Tunas, and every so often, an ornate and heavily guarded entrance to a country.     Mat\u00edas Duarte believes the Nordelta walls made the flooding worse for Las Tunas residents. Photograph: Drew Reed    Inside Nordelta, however, none of this impact on the outside world seems to register. Families have all they need to live the lives dreamt by their immigrant forebears. Urbanism researcher Michael Janoschka, in a study he conducted of Nordelta, was taken aback by the homogeneity of the social structure there. \u201cWhen I do these studies, I keep requesting interviews until each subject gives me the same information as the next,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Nordelta, it didn\u2019t take long for me to reach that point.\u201d Breaking down the wall When they heard what was happening at the perimeter wall, Mat\u00edas Duarte and his family resolved to wade through the knee-deep floodwaters to join the crowd that had gathered. They didn\u2019t get very far before they were stopped by the sound of gunfire.    We broke the wall open and five minutes later, the floodwater washed away  Las Tunas resident     Private guards in La Comarca, another gated community that borders Nordelta, had been alerted of the Las Tunas residents trying to break down the wall, and were firing warning shots. Provincial police soon arrived on the scene, and the crowd dispersed. But their goal had already been accomplished: they had made a hole in the wall to release floodwaters. According to accounts published in local media shortly after the flooding occurred, the wall was broken at 3.30am on 2 April. Amid torrential rains that would cause major flooding and nearly 100 deaths in central Buenos Aires and La Plata: \u201cWe broke the wall open and five minutes later, the floodwater washed away,\u201d one resident remarked. Rescue efforts were patchy and disorderly, however. Duarte says he later found out that, while Las Tunas was still covered in floodwaters, authorities had access to 10 rescue boats that were never used. \u201cThey never told us why they didn\u2019t use those boats,\u201d he says. Word soon spread that a protest had been called to disrupt the nearby freeway, in an attempt to obtain a more substantial response from the city\u2019s authorities. When Duarte\u2019s family got there, they found it wasn\u2019t just people from Las Tunas who were protesting: \u201cWe had people from Rojas, Palomar, and Rinc\u00f3n de Milberg come to the protest,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir houses had flooded just like ours had. Everyone needed help, fast. And they weren\u2019t getting any at all.\u201d The same freak storm that generated so much devastation in Las Tunas was hardly felt in Nordelta. No protest was organised, because none was needed. Many residents didn\u2019t even wake up. Patricia Pintos, a geographer at the National University of La Plata, doesn\u2019t think this happened by accident. \u201cNordelta required an immense amount of hydrological engineering,\u201d she says, noting that the development\u2019s construction of artificially raised land and manmade lakes helps it to remain dry during floods.

Photograph: Agustin Marcarian/Reuters    But the construction of Nordelta and other countries on top of wetlands came at a price for Las Tunas and other low-lying areas near creeks and rivers \u2013 not least because the loss of these wetlands removes the area\u2019s natural capacity to absorb floodwater. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased flooding in many different areas, especially north-west of Buenos Aires,\u201d Pintos says. \u201cThere are many reasons for this, but it\u2019s impossible not to conclude that the countries aren\u2019t playing a part.\u201d For Las Tunas, this is especially pronounced since the arroyo Las Tunas flows directly from Las Tunas into Nordelta.    Now, the only way anyone from Las Tunas sees the inside of Nordelta is by getting a job as cleaning staff  Mat\u00edas \u200bDuarte     And flooding is just one of a number of problems created by these walled-off neighbourhoods for people \u201con the other side\u201d. The patchwork landscape they create makes travelling via public transport more difficult, and costly private utility systems make building public utilities to non-gated areas less economically viable. Conscious of the problems it has created for Las Tunas, in 2001 Nordelta created an eponymous foundation to provide aid and assistance to local residents. It offers regular classes, healthcare and emergency relief in the case of floods. \u201cWe\u2019ve participated actively in flood relief campaigns, and have been working with the city to provide more adequate services to the area,\u201d says Luciana Silvestri, a representative with the Nordelta Foundation, adding that much of their support comes directly from residents of Nordelta.

Photograph: Drew Reed    But to become a more viable neighbourhood, Las Tunas needs effective public utilities that can only provided by the city government. Providing these services has not been a high priority for Tigre, the town in which both Las Tunas and Nordelta are located.  Tigre\u2019s public works department has produced some piecemeal reforms in Las Tunas, including shallow drainage ditches in the most flood prone areas. But officials flatly deny that gated communities are contributing to the problem. \u201cWhen I started working here decades ago, floods were far worse than they are now,\u201d says Alberto Lacioppa, director of the infrastructure and networks division of the public works department. \u201cThe gated communities haven\u2019t changed the situation at all. They are irrelevant.\u201d After the floods Three years on from the flood, Duarte no longer lives in Las Tunas. But he comes back regularly, to help teach children in the neighbourhood, and to lend a hand wherever residents need help. He\u2019s quick to point out that the 2013 flood wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Significant flooding also occurred there in November 2014 and August 2015. When I arrive at the makeshift school where he and other volunteers teach, he shows me the mark left by floodwater on the school\u2019s walls, distorting a mural painted by students. He insists, too, on showing me the wall that had been broken down back in 2013. Duarte tells me that when he was little, this spot used to be an open field where neighbourhood families would have picnics on weekends. \u201cWhen we first learned they were going to build this new neighbourhood [Nordelta], many of us were excited. Think of all the opportunities it would provide,\u201d he tells me. \u201cNow, the only way anyone from Las Tunas sees the inside of Nordelta is by getting a job as cleaning staff.\u201d   Related: Story of cities #33: how Santiago tackled its housing crisis with 'Operation Chalk'    A block onwards, we arrive at the arroyo Las Tunas, and the spot where the wall was broken down. It\u2019s hard to tell anything ever happened here \u2013 the only indication is a new set of electrified wires, rising ominously above the concrete wall. There is some hope, however, that relief for the floods that plague Las Tunas may be on the way. Argentina\u2019s new centre right president Mauricio Macri has indicated that flood prevention is a high priority for his government. Lacioppa believes that new government leaders at the federal and provincial levels will help his department to implement new reforms, including pumps and the widening of a railroad bridge that routinely blocks the flow of water. But Janoschka is less optimistic. He feels that Macri\u2019s government will unleash a glut of foreign capital, further carving up the landscape with little regard for those on the wrong side of the wall. \u201cYou know, I used to think the only problem with this wall was the floods it caused,\u201d Duarte says as we walk back home. \u201cBut the more I thought about it, the more I started asking myself, \u2018What purpose does this wall really serve? Wouldn\u2019t we all be better off without it?\u2019\u201d Does your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?

She recounts these and other intertwined stories of contested loves and multiple leave-takings in a long letter to Elijah, the lover she meets in the States and loses several times. In contrast to Elijah\u2019s affluent American background, Zubaida is an adopted child. And though her background in Bangladesh is equally privileged, it comes with a tortured legacy: \u201cI knew my parents questioned whether I cared about the country as much as they did, and I never really felt the need, or had the courage, to confess that I did not. I was proud that they had been in the war, proud to call my parents freedom fighters, but in reality I resented the space that it took up \u2026 so that all it took was a brush against history to reveal the shiny betterness of the past.\u201d   Related: Tahmima Anam: \u2018I have a complicated relationship with Bangladesh\u2019    It is, however, the present, and the mysteries of her own past, that Zubaida seeks to explore. Her story begins at its end, with a letter and a little pile of whale bones that remind her of a trip she once made to Pakistan, where she saw a Baluchi colleague arrested (and possibly murdered) on suspicion of terrorist activities. Divided between a sense of duty to her roots and the urge to go outwards in search of a future entirely her own, Zubaida is drawn back to Bangladesh and a marriage to her childhood sweetheart, Rashid, abandoning Elijah in the US. In flight from her rich in-laws, Zubaida leaves the luxuries of Dhaka for a stint in the dockyards of Chittagong, where she is exposed to the underbelly of Bangladeshi life. In a startling shift, the narrative is taken over for several pages by the male voice of Anwar. In his account of the lover and child he abandoned, the prose darkens and revels in the contrast between Dhaka\u2019s opulence and the harshness of life in the slums and rural hinterlands: \u201cOut there in the village, no matter how hungry you are, you wake up every morning and you smell paddy, you smell mud and earth and dung. Dung is roses compared to human shit. We rule the world but our shit smells worse than any animal\u2019s.\u201d    In a sense, Elijah represents the reader, who has to understand the narrative burden this novel shoulders    In his search for a decent living, Anwar spends time on a building site in Dubai, where the labourers\u2019 congested camp and the endless malls with their unattainable goods are grimly contrasted. Men\u2019s lives and women\u2019s seem equally cheap: on his return, Anwar discovers that the woman he left behind probably ended up in a brothel. Anwar\u2019s connection to Zubaida is revealed towards the end of the story, when she is again faced with conflicting choices: the chance to claim \u201cthe abandoned child\u201d and the urge to be free of her own compulsion to conform to social norms that seem increasingly alien. But before that, Elijah arrives in Bangladesh, and the narrative tone shifts again, from stark realism to a rhapsodic romanticism embodied in the songs Elijah plays to Zubaida on an abandoned piano in a ship marked for destruction. Anam\u2019s portrayal of relationships that swing between duty and free choice is most convincing in Zubaida\u2019s contradictory attitudes to Rashid, the husband her adopted mother loves like a son, and who takes her back in spite of his doubts and ambivalence. In contrast, her love for Elijah remains displaced, perhaps because it is tentative and, at least for her, limited by her own psychological contingencies. The Bones of Grace is a long novel; intricately structured, it attempts to reassemble all its floating clues and end at its starting point, with its heroine reconstructing an elliptical past and searching for an elusive future. In a sense, Elijah represents the reader, who has to understand the narrative burden this novel shoulders: personal destinies and public roles, national and international economies of desire and labour, and \u2013 perhaps most compellingly \u2013 the shadows of a traumatic past which nearly destroyed a nation. From a gloss on the Bengali early 20th-century feminist Begum Rokeya to the issues surrounding the punishment of ageing war criminals, the story is speckled with anecdotes from the history of a country both young and very old. No love story, Zubaida and her author seem to say, can reach closure until the layered shadows of our past are dispersed. \u2022 Aamer Hussein\u2019s most recent work of fiction is 37 Bridges and Other Stories (HarperCollins India).

A year ago, Bath were preparing for the Premiership play-offs on their way to the final, while Gloucester were dusting a shelf in their trophy cabinet to rest the European Challenge Cup on. The contrasting moves reflect the difference in the way the two clubs are run: Bath by a very hands-on chairman, Bruce Craig, Gloucester by a board that invests authority in the chief executive at Kingsholm, Stephen Vaughan.   Related: Saracens sweep honours at Premiership end-of-season awards night    When Vaughan arrived at Kingsholm at the end of December 2012 after being involved in the London Olympics, the first job he gave himself was to look at the club\u2019s coaching structure and compare it to other setups, in the Premiership and the Pro12, using success as his starting point. He visited Leicester, Northampton, Saracens, Leinster, Munster and Glasgow before making a change at Kingsholm two summers ago. \u201cI wanted to look at the coaching structure at those clubs and the longevity of coaches,\u201d says Vaughan, who supported Moseley growing up before turning to football, playing for Walsall as a youth apprentice and on a short professional contract. \u201cA couple of things stuck out,\u201d he says. \u201cAt that time, we had Nigel Davies as head coach but he also acted as director of rugby: he dealt with strength and conditioning, the academy, recruitment and retention, the media and the board as well as coaching the team. Our structure was wrong. \u201cEvery club that had been successful had had a director of rugby who was allowed to be exactly that: our setup lacked bandwidth and we needed to change it. It was also clear that once clubs decided they had the right people in, they put them on long-term contracts. Successful clubs do not chop and change. When David Humphreys came in as director of rugby before the start of last season, we had 25 new players. It was not his team and we knew it would take him three or four years to get the personnel to say it was his team as well as the playing style, culture and discipline he expected. You have to give people time and while we have finished ninth and eighth in the last two seasons, the progress behind the scenes has been huge. A priority for us now is to develop our training facilities at Hartpury college, which were designed for 33 players, plus coaches but now cater for some 90 people.\u201d Vaughan does not fit the stereotype of an executive, happier standing in the Shed at Kingsholm than sitting in the chairman\u2019s box quaffing wine and scoffing vol-au-vents. Neither was his background typical: his three-season career with Walsall was followed by a stint as a Club 18-30 rep, having had to indulge in the outlandish during his interview. \u201cI was at Walsall from 1991-93,\u201d says Vaughan, a supporter of Aston Villa. \u201cKenny Hibbitt was the manager and due to an innate lack of talent I was allowed to leave. I loved it and have some fantastic memories, not least an FA Youth Cup game we played at Old Trafford in front of 7,000 spectators against a Manchester United squad that included the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt while Ryan Giggs, who had already played for the senior team, was on the bench. And Robbie Savage played for them. I still have the programme: we lost 2-1. I played at Stamford Bridge and other wonderful grounds and then went part-time in non-league football.     Gloucester\u2019s Stephen Vaughan had three seasons with Walsall Football Club. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock    \u201cI worked for Land Rover on the track, taking people out in Discoveries. I hated it with a passion and was so miserable that my sister, without telling me, applied for a job with Club 18-30 on my behalf. I had to do stupid stuff in the interview, like singing Barry Manilow, something I did in front of the players this season when we went to Zebre, and I got the job for three months. I really enjoyed it and stayed on. I became rep of the year and got my own island. Two years in, Thomas Cook bought the company and four years after that I worked my way up to managing director. Then I became MD of Thomas Cook\u2019s specialist businesses and finished off with them at the 2012 Olympics. \u201cI was offered a role in football, a job in Dubai with an airline and one in New York with another company. And I was headhunted by Gloucester: having been into rugby as a Moseley supporter, I knew what the club was all about and that had it not been for Tom Walkinshaw back in the day when he took over, Gloucester could have gone the way of Moseley and Coventry. A lot has changed in three years I have been here but we are still working to the self\u2011sustainable model. We will not load the club with debt and losses every year. Our only debt is on the stand we built seven years ago and we are paying it off quickly. \u201cI am not someone who likes sitting in the chairman\u2019s box, not least because I like to show my emotion during a game. I will stand at the back of the stand or slip into the Shed, a rite of passage for Gloucester rugby folk, incognito, although I was recognised there this season during the game against Newcastle. I like to sample things from the supporters\u2019 perspective and the Shed is a great place. As chief executive, life is cool when we win; when we don\u2019t, the beer is not cold enough or it is too expensive or the speakers don\u2019t work. We have plans to build a fanzone at Kingsholm to try and get supporters here earlier and stay later, providing them with better food, drink and entertainment. \u201cWe could extend the capacity at the ground but it would be an ego trip at the moment. We invested a lot in the playing department per se by changing its structure, which is why we will make a small loss this year. We speculated and have yet to accumulate, planning for success over a four or five-year period, starting with getting into the Champions Cup. We knew the risk but felt we did not have an option because it starts and ends on the pitch. If we can get into the top four there is no reason why we cannot get turnover up from \u00a315m to near \u00a320m and get some more seats in. I hate the expression but we are a sleeping giant.\u201d When Vaughan played for Walsall, he was, in his own words, skinny. The nutritional advice he received was to bulk up by drinking Guinness, not a route the Gloucester players are being encouraged to take by their performance chef, Will Carvalho, who was hired last summer after being lured from the Brazil women\u2019s football team. \u201cThe players reckon that Will is the best signing we have made,\u201d Vaughan says. \u201cThey have breakfast and lunch at Hartpury and are given advice on what to eat in the evenings. He goes with the squad when they stay away, speaking to hotels about what the players need to eat and overseeing the preparation. His food is fantastic and he ensures that the nutritional balance for players leading up to a game is at the optimum level. We did our research before appointing him and the field of nutrition is vastly different to when I was playing football. \u201cI was given money to buy Guinness and told to get on the weights. Sport has changed dramatically and players are now self-policing. When I watched Moseley, some players would have a quick fag in the tunnel before running on to the pitch but we are now at the stage in the professional game where there are no players with links to the amateur game. The modern professional knows no different.\u201d    I was given money to buy Guinness and told to get on the weights. Sport has changed and players are now self-policing    The season may have ended for Gloucester but the summer is Vaughan\u2019s busiest time with recruitment still to be completed. \u201cIt is difficult in the current market because when you negotiate a deal, you sometimes find that a player\u2019s value doubles. It is important for us to increase our revenue: we have two sellout concerts at Kingsholm this summer, Lionel Richie and Jess Glynne, and we are starting other initiatives. \u201cI meet David Humphreys every week and the first thing we do is go through a matrix of players from one to 15 to make sure we have a succession plan. You can see where the gaps are: you need 15 England-qualified players in your match-day 23 throughout the season to release a certain amount of cash, which will increase under the new deal with Twickenham. I agree with that because we have to keep the Premiership as English as we can the help the national team: when you look at what has happened in France, where the Top 14 is one thing and the French side something else, it is important. That said, we have scouts in other leagues and in Super Rugby and we profile players throughout the year. Agents play a big part but rarely do you get a free run at a player. Other clubs are always interested and that drives up the price.\u201d Another issue Vaughan is looking at is the implications of a no vote in next month\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. One immediate concern of a Brexit would be the future of the Kolpak players in the Premiership who, even though they are not EU nationals, do not need work permits. In rugby, it applies to players from the South Sea islands and South Africa. \u201cWe have players at Gloucester who would potentially be affected,\u201d says Vaughan. \u201cIf we were out of the EU, the Kolpak ruling would no longer apply here and we would have to lobby and explain how players could find themselves unemployed and how harder it would be for clubs to recruit players. It is a great unknown that we are concerned about.\u201d \u2022 This is an extract taken from The Breakdown, the Guardian\u2019s weekly rugby union email.

It was a two-day hike to the closest shop, and a three-hour speedboat ride to the nearest town, from which the family would have to take a helicopter ride to get home. It was here that Brooke began home-schooling their three children then aged five, three and one. \u201cMy children learned local games and we spent a lot of time outside. They learned to use a bush knife, they picked coffee beans and played in local streams, catching small wildlife. They built huts and treehouses and explored the nearby jungle,\u201d she says.     Brooke and Joey Tartaglia with their family when they lived in Papua New Guinea.    The Tartaglias taught their children using an American curriculum called Christian Light Education, which is textbook-based. \u201cIt was very important to us that our children could flow seamlessly back and forth between school in America and school in the jungle. We knew that our children would likely return to their home country at some point, and we did not want them to be behind for their ages and grades.\u201d A typical day at school would start at 9am. The children would work in their rooms on whatever subject they wanted from their daily list. They would break for lunch outside and then have an afternoon of history and bible lessons until school finished at 3.30pm. \u201cIf they still had things to do they would continue working until later, but if they\u2019d finished they could play outside until dinner,\u201d Brooke explains. While there are no available statistics on the number of parents teaching their children in remote and wild locations, home-schooling is on the rise. Figures released last year show that in the six years up to 2015 there was a 65% increase in the number of UK children being educated at home. For many families, teaching children away from the rat race has major benefits. Biologists Rebecca and Ryan Means home-school their child in Wakulla county Florida. For a few months every year they journey to the remotest location in their chosen state (determined by distance from the nearest road) and live out of their vehicle, camping their way across the country.    We like to say the world is our classroom    They take their seven-year-old daughter, Skyla, and allow her curiosity to run wild in the new learning environments they see. \u201cWe do not use a specific curriculum and we do not plan out what we are going to learn,\u201d says Rebecca, adding that Skyla often accompanies her parents on their wetland work, gaining experience of scientific research and ecology. They adopt an approach known as \u201cunschooling\u201d. It gives children free rein to learn at their own pace, unlike the Tartaglia\u2019s curriculum-based method. \u201cShe is a very creative child so we try to feed that as much as we can \u2026 a lot of the time she plays with the leaves, logs, sticks, etc. We like to say the world is our classroom.\u201d Rebecca gives an example of a typical lesson, saying that while they were on a 10-day backpacking trip in remote Montana, her daughter learned about food chains and food webs. \u201cIt started when we found some bear scat. By looking at the poop we could see that the bear was eating berries. Further up the trail we found the plant that had produced the berries and learned about that plant, how it uses energy from the sun.\u201d Other aspects they focus on while exploring the natural environment include the water cycle and local history. Skyla practises her writing by keeping a journal. Brits Daniel and Clair Prince have been world-schooling their four children aged nine, seven and four-year-old twins since 2014 in locations including Cambodia, Croatia, Dubai, Italy, Australia, Thailand and the US. They advocate home-schooling through experiential learning. \u201cIt\u2019s hands-on, the child is immersed in the moment and learning on the ground \u2026 The child can relate to what they are learning much easier and retain the information.\u201d     Daniel and Clair Prince have been world-schooling their four children since 2014.    Just like the Tartaglia children when they moved to Papua New Guinea, the Prince children are very young. The Tartaglia family moved back to the US when their children were starting high school and Brooke says that the transition into mainstream schooling wasn\u2019t difficult. \u201cOur oldest went right into high school here, and the next two transitioned from home-school into high school over the next couple of years.\u201d That\u2019s not to say, however, that teaching in distant parts of the world doesn\u2019t have drawbacks. Rebecca\u2019s greatest challenge is accepting that sometimes what she wants Skyla to learn may not be what is best for her at that moment. She explains: \u201cHome-schooling takes time, especially if you are not following a curriculum that spells out exactly what you should do and when and you need to provide learning materials.\u201d There are logistical challenges too. While Rebecca has to consider what learning tools she can carry in a rucksack, Brooke sometimes had to order books up to six months in advance to account for shipping times.  But Brooke found other concerns, such as making sure her children socialised, less of a challenge. \u201cIt became more difficult when our children became teenagers because the village children grow and mature at a much slower rate; our kids\u2019 friends were often four to five years older than themselves. This was fine until the village children got to be 18 or 19 and would get married when our children were only 13 and 14.\u201d   Related: How to teach ... foraging    The success of wild schooling depends on the circumstances in which children learn, according to Peter Gray, research professor at the Department of Psychology at Boston College, who advocates unschooling. \u201cMy research indicates that we don\u2019t have to worry about children learning academic skills and information in a timely manner. If kids have been living a playful, involved life so their minds have been active, they can easily catch up on the rest, even in learning to read, any time they wish, very quickly.\u201d The Department for Education in the UK, however, is more cautious. Their spokesperson says: \u201cWe recognise parents may choose to home-school their children and many do a good job, but the education these children receive must be of a suitable quality.\u201d However, families, such as the Princes, have found it a fulfilling experience for the child and parent. Prior to going away they felt they had not been spending enough time together, but all that changed. \u201cIt has certainly made our relationships [as a family] stronger,\u201d Clair concludes.

Photograph: Eelco Roos/Hivos    According to official records, however, the gold they unearth doesn\u2019t exist. The work of children who risk their lives for a few dollars a day is fuelling a lucrative trade in illegal gold that is smuggled out of the country and into products and supply chains worldwide. Following UN sanctions on Ugandans buying from traders in the nearby Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2007, Uganda\u2019s official gold exports dropped from 6.9 tonnes in 2006 to 14 kilos in 2015. Yet according to analysis by the Dutch research company Somo and the Stop Child Labour coalition, gold exports from illegal artisanal mines amount to up to 2.8 tonnes a year. \u201cOfficially there is no significant gold mining industry in Uganda, but the reality is that there is a thriving illegal gold trade where up to 30% of gold miners are children,\u201d says Irene Schipper, a senior researcher at Somo.  \u201cOur research shows that the difference between the official export figures and the actual amount of gold exported from Uganda is huge \u2026 This is an entirely unregulated industry with no checks in place at all.\u201d Gold from artisanal mines is bought by independent traders. One such trader, an information technology graduate who saw a business opportunity in the booming illegal gold trade after failing to get a job in Kampala, travels from mine to mine, buying gold and carrying it back to the capital. \u201c[We] take it to Kampala and sell mostly to Indians, who then export it to China and Dubai,\u201d he said.  Gold is filtered on to companies that, unregulated and ignored by government officials, broker deals with overseas buyers.  \u201cWe buy the gold. We do not care where it is from. If you have the gold we shall buy it,\u201d said the desk clerk for one such firm. \u201cIt is our business.\u201d According to Somo\u2019s research, much of the gold mined by child labourers is smuggled through Uganda\u2019s porous borders and mixed with official gold exports before being traded on the international markets. \u201cThe main problem for the children is that they are only looking at the short-term possibility of earning money to survive, but the gold mines are disastrous for their futures,\u201d says Schipper. \u201cThey will not escape this low paid and dangerous work. They all work with mercury and none seem to be aware of the dangers. It isn\u2019t just governments who need to be addressing this. Companies need to be more vigilant in checking their supply chains and to take steps to eradicate the use of mercury in the mines where their gold is coming from.\u201d      Using makeshift pans, children sluice gold ore while standing ankle deep in water. Photograph: Eelco Roos/Hivos    Local NGOs and child protection agencies working at the mines say they cannot stop children looking for mine work. With more than 60% of the country on less than $3 (\u00a32.06) a day, the state education system in decline, and youth unemployment at about 65%, the children at Mubende mines consider themselves lucky to have jobs. Agaba sees a better future for himself in mining than at the government school to which his father sent him.  \u201cI felt squeezed in a corner. We all know that there is no future when you go to a government school, it was as good as not going to school,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing good that would have come out of it. At least here I make money.\u201d \u201cIt has become normal to us now,\u201d says Stephen Turyahikayo, a researcher for the Centre for Research and Sustainable Solutions, a Ugandan NGO working at the mines. \u201cNobody seems to care about these children. Not the government. Not the companies.\u201d Agaba\u2019s scarred hands are testament to the hard labour of his daily life. He says on a good day he makes 10,000 shillings, about $2.50. Every night he sleeps in a tent made of sticks and blue polythene paper, sharing with eight other boys who drift in and out of the local mines searching for work. The ILO estimates that there are up to 1 million children working in mining globally. While efforts have been made to regulate the global gold trade, illegal and artisanal gold mining is still riddled with child labour, trafficking and sexual exploitation.     Children at work on a gold mine in Uganda. Photograph: Eelco Roos/Hivos    \u201cWhat we are seeing in the small-scale gold mines of Uganda and across Africa and the rest of the world is the very worst forms of child labour associated with one of the world\u2019s most valuable commodities,\u201d says Nadine Osseiran, senior programmes officer at the ILO.  \u201cIn the often unregulated and illegal artisanal gold mining sector there are no structures in place to protect these workers and it is impossible to stop gold dug by children entering global supply chains. There is almost no control over where gold comes from or where it is purchased. \u201cAt the ILO we believe that child labour in gold mining could be eliminated in 10 years but, unfortunately, there is simply not the funding coming in to make this a reality.\u201d Although Uganda has taken some measures to tackle child labour, a ban on children working in the sector was not included in the country\u2019s 2003 Mining Act.  The mines are all that children like Agaba have. \u201cI am going to work here. Live here. Grow up and die here,\u201d he says.  *Name changed to protect identity", "title": "Silence far from golden for child labourers in the mines of Uganda", "sentences": ["\u201c[We] take it to Kampala and sell mostly to Indians, who then export it to China and Dubai,\u201d he said."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-20T06:00:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/andy-murray-relaxed-french-open-tennis-jamie-delgado-coach", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "French Open 2016", "Roger Federer", "French Open", "Rafael Nadal", "Novak Djokovic", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "There is one way for Andy Murray to end speculation about who is going to be his next coach: hire one. He did not sound close to making that decision in Paris but, under repeated questioning, said he may consider making it a job-share for his assistant, Jamie Delgado. Were the world No2 to continue his excellent run on clay \u2013 and getting the qualifier Radek Stepanek in the first round, with perhaps another in the second, did his chances in this French Open no harm at all \u2013 Delgado, whom he has known for a long time, could find himself picking up where Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo prematurely left off a few weeks ago. \u201cIf there is something I feel could help me, then I would look into that in terms of another person to help out, and also to give him a break as well from time to time,\u201d Murray said. \u201cTravelling every single week during the year and every practice week is tough.   Related: Roger Federer pulls out of French Open to avoid \u2018unnecessary fitness risk\u2019    \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of our relationship. Normally over time, when you spend so much time with each other, having a little bit of separation can be good too \u2013 but I enjoy working with him. We get on well away from the court. He\u2019s a very good people person. He gets on well with my whole team. I find it very easy to chat to him. He\u2019s pretty calm, relaxed. \u201cOn top of that he\u2019s very experienced around the tour. He\u2019s played, like, 23 Wimbledons in a row [including juniors], so he\u2019s been around the game a long time. He\u2019s a good coach. I enjoy working with him and he had good results too with Gilles M\u00fcller. We have started well.\u201d Delgado probably could not have written a better job application himself. The atmosphere around Roland Garros has been muted but, if Paris lacks a certain joie de vivre, it is understandable. Tragedy in and beyond the city dwarf sport and Rafael Nadal reflected the mood when asked if he felt safe on the eve of a tournament he has won nine times. \u201cAlways I feel safe when I am here in Paris,\u201d the Spaniard said and he was not talking about the draw, which has pitched him into the same half as the world No1, Novak Djokovic, as elevated fourth seed following Roger Federer\u2019s withdrawal on Thursday through injury. \u201cWhat happened [six months ago during the Paris shootings and the downed Egyptian airline this week] was terrible news but it\u2019s past. I believe that people who organise the event and the whole city [are] 100% focused on making it safe for not only the players but for the fans and everybody.\u201d It was good to hear a leading player lend perspective to a mere tennis tournament while armed police roamed the nearby streets and security checks for fans and media every few hundred yards. There is tension, not unlike that surrounding the Davis Cup final in Ghent last November, just after terrorists raked their way through Paris with guns and bombs. Once play begins on Sunday, tennis will be the focus and, as ever, it will not be a dull affair. Murray happily admits his linguistic skills are minimal but he gets \u201cvive la diff\u00e9rence\u201d when he comes to Paris, from losing his way on the M\u00e9tro a few years ago to taking on the combative crowds on Court Philippe Chatrier, the tournament\u2019s raucous hub. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough at the French Open, compared to anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s good. If they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re getting value for money, they let you know about it. That definitely wouldn\u2019t happen at Wimbledon and I like that too. I don\u2019t mind. I like the US Open too. It\u2019s also very different to Wimbledon. And I do like the big crowds. Tennis needs to embrace different elements. I like all the differences.\u201d Murray, like so many players, says he pays little heed to how the draw falls but he would have had to be taking a break on Mars not to know he has avoided Djokovic or Nadal until the final Sunday. A kind draw boosts his chances considerably, especially if Nadal\u2019s form revival continues and he can put Djokovic out of the picture. Murray is not taking a seemingly easy start for granted. \u201cThe qualifiers have won three matches here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s tough. They are probably feeling pretty good about their conditions and comfortable on the courts. It\u2019s only two days out from the start of the tournament and I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m playing against yet.\u201d Stan Wawrinka, such a heroic champion last year but in the doldrums lately, is Murray\u2019s possible hurdle in the semi-finals, although the Scot will probably have to beat Nick Kyrgios or Kei Nishikori first. Also lurking in Murray\u2019s quarter is Kyle Edmund but he will do well to get past John Isner in the second round. And what of the absent Federer, the perennial talking point? Nadal is adamant: \u201cFor me it\u2019s not changing much, no? But I understand that for the fans, for the tournament, for the world in tennis in general it is a very negative news, no? The same happened with Madrid and with Indian Wells, Miami, with Dubai, no? Every tournament a big player like him is not able to play is negative news for the world of tennis.\u201d Relief or reality? It was difficult to tell \u2013 especially as Federer was hardly expected to shine in Paris, given his recent history here and his wretched 2016. Not that the Spaniard has been handed an easy path to the semi-finals. He may have a potentially tricky third-round encounter with the unpredictable Fabio Fognini, followed by a pair of dangerous gunslingers in Dominic Thiem, who beat Federer in Rome last week, and Jiri Vesely in the quarter-finals. Djokovic\u2019s route is not exactly a minefield, with all due respect to Aljaz Bedene, who has a qualifier to ease him into the second round, where he will probably meet the 31st seed, Federico Delbonis, for a chance to play the Serb. And that should be that for his tournament \u2013 if he gets that far. Djokovic could have the precocious talent of Borna Coric to deal with in the fourth round and Feliciano L\u00f3pez in the quarters. It is likely he will have expended less energy than Nadal if they do meet in the semi-finals.", "title": "Andy Murray relaxed for French Open with a little help from his friend", "sentences": ["The same happened with Madrid and with Indian Wells, Miami, with Dubai, no?"], "publicationDate": "2016-05-20T17:09:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/21/tiny-scratches-large-bills-hire-car-green-motion", "tags": ["Motoring", "Money", "Consumer affairs", "Consumer rights", "UK news"], "article": "When French television journalist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hadas-Lebel from Paris booked a hire car for her family for a visit to Britain, she was impressed by the environmental credentials of franchised rental company Green Motion. At Birmingham airport, in the pouring rain, she says they collected the car and pointed out a few scratches to the agent, but were told not to worry about them. However when they returned the vehicle, after a problem-free break, she says they were told that \u00a3200 would be taken from\u00a0their credit card for a tiny scratch to the vehicle (red car, pictured above). \u201cWhen we came back, the car was in perfect condition \u2013 my husband is an excellent driver. At the last minute, [the agent] pointed out a mark the size of a needle on the door edge (we took a picture of it). Back at the agency, his colleague told him we should pay nearly\u00a0\u00a3200 for it, despite the insurance\u00a0my husband had paid!\u201d She claims that it felt like blackmail when the company, threatened to deduct an even larger amount if he did not pay on the spot. Ms Hadas-Lebel\u2019s complaint is not the only one made to Guardian Money about tiny scratches that result in large bills from Green Motion. Fiona Kerly, who works in Dubai, says she was charged \u00a3400 in February at its Birmingham airport depot for alleged damage to a bumper. She says she drove just 68 miles in the rental vehcile, to and from hospital to see her father, and returned the car after a week.    They said I had to pay \u00a3400 before I could leave \u2026 There is no way the bump happened during the week I had the car  Fiona Kerly     \u201cThe guy checked the car and pointed to a bump in the bumper which, if it was there before, I would never have noticed it as the car was so dirty when I picked it up. They said I had to pay \u00a3400 before I could leave. If I refused to pay I was threatened with a \u00a31,000 excess. I panicked that I would miss my flight so was in a very vulnerable situation. There is no way the bump happened during the week I had the car,\u201d she claims. Jamie Moss hired a car from the Luton branch of Green Motion in February. \u201cAfter an hour\u2019s wait I was given a Peugeot 208 with a missing wing mirror case and an apparent and obvious scratch on the front left wheel and a few other obvious dents. This was all marked on the form, which I had to check over myself. When I returned the car a member of staff came out to inspect the vehicle.\u201d Moss was told there was a 2mm scratch. \u201cI could hardly see what he was pointing out.\u201d He was charged \u00a3216. Later, after making vigorous complaints, including on Twitter, he says he was refunded. Lee Haines says that after hiring from Green Motion in April he was told he would have to pay \u00a3340 for the damage to the white car pictured above. \u201cThe damage was so small I would have missed it or thought it incidental on a pre-rental inspection.\u201d Green Motion rejects the allegations. It says it is justified in charging post-rental fees, which are set out in a \u201cprice matrix\u201d displayed to customers. It said that customers sign a post-rental inspection form, that it is a member of industry body BVRLA for dispute resolution, and that the vast majority of its 45,000 rentals so far this year have been trouble free. The battles between Green Motion and the customers who have contacted us revolve around two areas: the alleged existence of the scratches before the vehicle was hired, and what is the fair price for a repair if it was indeed caused by the driver. Money contacted several firms that offer to repair minor scratches. An agent for ChipsAway, the UK\u2019s biggest damage repair firm, told us that for the smallest scratch the cost would be around \u00a330 plus VAT, while a deeper scratch that has gone through the paint would cost \u00a3120 plus VAT. When Kamlesh Khetia returned a car to Green Motion\u2019s Edinburgh branch, he says the agent pointed out a scratch and initially asked for \u00a31,495. After a row broke out, staff offered to end the matter if he paid them \u00a3194.40. In the Leicester branch, Ismail Seedat says he was told he would have to pay more than \u00a31,600 for three alleged scratches and scrapes, including \u00a3492 to repair a front bumper (pictured above).    Hand on heart I did not cause the 15mm scratch on the alloy trim. The \u00a3192 charge will hopefully be refunded by Axa  Gren Robinson     Other Green Motion hirers are adamant they did not cause the scratches. Caroline Shirley, who hired from the company\u2019s Heathrow branch, says she was charged \u00a3138 for a scratch on the back-left wheel: \u201cI am 100% sure that was not caused by us.\u201d Meanwhile, Gren Robinson says he was charged \u00a3192 after a three-day hire from Stansted airport. \u201cI booked it via Holiday Autos and, fortunately, took the optional excess protection insurance. Hand on heart I did not cause the 15mm scratch located on the alloy wheel trim. The \u00a3192 charge will hopefully be refunded by Axa.\u201d Last October, Money reported on the case of PJ from Australia, who was charged \u00a3351 after staff at the Leicester branch alleged he caused a blemish on the bumper\u2019s underside. This was only fully visible when kneeling down, he says. \u201cI asked to see the manager who went into what appeared to be a well rehearsed speech. He told me that the price for repair was \u00a3500. Eventually he reduced it to \u00a3351.\u201d In a statement, Green Motion said: \u201cIn the rare instance that damage has appeared on a vehicle that was not otherwise there before the rental period, Green Motion is entirely justified in charging post-rental fees. \u201cCustomers are required to sign a vehicle condition report prior to taking possession of a vehicle, accepting all pre-existing damage and confirming that there are no further instances of damage to the vehicle. It is the customer\u2019s responsibility to carefully inspect the vehicle. \u201cAt the end of the rental the vehicle is inspected again for additional damage and the customer is again asked to validate this inspection by signing a post rental inspection form. \u201cWe use a pre-calculated estimate of what it will cost to effect the repairs, set out in a price matrix. The prices are calculated using average repair cost data provided by valuation experts. The matrix is available at all locations and is displayed on the walls. We are a member of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, an independent trade body.

But walking from the ostentatious lobby of Cyber Tower 1 to the shops and restaurants can take 20 minutes \u2013 if you don\u2019t get lost along the way. The fastest route by foot bisects car parks, traverses overgrown vacant lots, and stumbles over temporary walkways past some of the biggest businesses on the island. Both an urban planning disaster and \u2013 for many proud Mauritians \u2013 the very definition of modern office life, Cybercity was first proposed by the government in 2001 as a high-tech hub, and now houses almost 25,000 mostly educated, middle-class workers during the week. While the development can be criticised for a shocking lack cohesiveness, poor public transport, limited parking or even difficult access by foot, its creation did bring many aspects of modern connected life to Mauritian workers. \u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect, but it\u2019s better than we had before,\u201d says Ross Macbeth, a Scottish-trained architect based in Mauritius. Like other local observers, Macbeth says that despite its many design flaws, the project did what it set out to do: create a modern working environment in the African island state, while ameliorating traffic conditions in the capital, Port Louis. Built on sugar cane fields roughly 15km to the south along the M1 (one of two modern highways that bisect the country) and completely disconnected from the surrounding urban fabric, Cybercity was promoted as a leap into the future for Mauritius.

Photograph: Christopher Schuetze    Despite its many flaws, the 64-hectare campus boasts high-speed internet \u2013 which just a half a decade ago was a rarity in the country \u2013 backup electricity generators to bridge frequent power cuts, and networking systems to guarantee that big businesses can stay online constantly. Despite the island\u2019s geographic distance from mainland Africa, the hub is so well connected that it hosts the African Network Information Center, the internet registry platform for the entire continent. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a whole ecosystem of facilities: intelligent buildings, air conditioning and electric backup,\u201d says Koomaren Chetty, CEO of Business Parks of Mauritius (BPML), the company founded by the government to create and run Cybercity.    [Smart cities] create exclusive urban cities far away from the dust, chaos and inequality of the existing cityscape  Bertrand Moingeon     The initial phase of the project in 2001 \u2013 the building of the 12-storey Cyber Tower 1 \u2013 was designed, engineered and built by Indian companies, with financing for the project covered by loans guaranteed by the Indian government, in what Chetty calls a \u201cturn key\u201d construction. But when BPML commissioned a second building a few years later, they used local architects and construction companies \u2013 heralded at the time as an example of the Mauritians\u2019 ability to learn quickly from foreigners.   Now in its second decade, Cybercity highlights an important difference in planned urban growth between developed and developing countries. As the world\u2019s cities grow and intelligent urban design becomes a global discipline, a vision of this tiny African island\u2019s future demonstrates that the concept of a smart city is far from standardised.     Eb\u00e8ne Cybercity was built entirely from scratch on sugar cane fields. Photograph: Christopher Schuetze for the Guardian    \u201cIn Europe when we talk about smart cities, we think of revitalisation of existing cities,\u201d says Bertrand Moingeon, a professor at HEC in Paris who studies urban development in Mauritius. \u201cBut in many places in Africa, including Mauritius, so-called smart city developments actually do the opposite: they create exclusive urban cities far away from the dust, chaos and inequality of the existing cityscape,\u201d Moingeon explains. \u201cIt goes against social inclusiveness.\u201d Rashiq Fataar, an urbanist based in South Africa, agrees that many smart-city projects on the continent are based on the desire to start with a fresh slate. \u201cThe whole goal is to plan from scratch. Especially for the private sector, it\u2019s all about planning and controlling.\u201d Fataar, who runs the Future Cities consultants, warns that in an African context these projects tend to benefit a small elite, rather than the population as a whole: \u201cThese visions are often contrary to what\u2019s needed.\u201d Moingeon agrees: \u201cWhat we could wish for Africa is that they really develop the most recent model of smart cities,\u201d he says, referring to the latest European and North American developments of the concept, which emphasise social and environmental improvements. For example, in Ijburg \u2013 a brand new part of Amsterdam built on reclaimed river land \u2013 daycare centres, university spaces, schools, civic spaces and high-end properties were deliberately built together with the aim of creating community spaces that would be shared by people of different social-economic backgrounds and ages.     There is very little urban planning, in terms of amenities, parking and pedestrian areas  Abbas Currimjee     Given the size and ongoing growth of Cybercity (several new buildings are in the early phases of construction), keeping track of vacancy rates, which officials peg at somewhere between five and 15%, and overall gross floor area, which is given at roughly 200,000 sq metres, is difficult. However, judging by the parcels of land left vacant at the centre of this city, not everything has gone according to plan. \u201cIt lacks an urban fabric \u2013 there is very little urban planning, in terms of amenities, parking and pedestrian areas,\u201d says Abbas Currimjee, an architect and developer in Mauritius. To Currimjee, the problems plaguing this artificial city are less about the actual buildings and offices they contain, and more about the the project as a whole.      The modern office buildings are serviced by an outdated public transportation system. Photograph: Christopher Schuetze    Indeed, despite the fact that most of the office buildings are at least 10 storeys tall, the overall density of the project appears lower than the single-story residential neighbourhoods that are common here on the island. Much like the cacophony of architectural styles on display, individual buildings vary in the degree of modernity and comfort \u2013 and some exude a kind of shabbiness associated with a humid climate, poor ventilation, badly functioning air conditioning and the overwhelming smell of food. During even the lightest rain showers, the awning covering the exit of Cyber Tower 1 \u2013 arguably the showpiece of the project \u2013 funnels a steady gush of water on to the driveway leading up to the building with such ferocity that even cars avoid it.     Koomaren Chetty plans to create shared social spaces in Cybercity    On those rainy days, the shortage of parking and difficulties accessing the crowded public transport come to the fore. Instead of the sleek transport hub promised in future iterations of the smart city here in Mauritius, decidedly old-fashioned, high-floored diesel buses careen from one one street-side bus stop to next, leaving the crowds of well-dressed office workers running for cover. Urban development has become a political hot potato on this island of almost 1.3 million inhabitants. Now in its second decade, Cybercity and the government\u2019s involvement is coming under scrutiny as a new administration has announced the creation of several new smart city projects around the island \u2013 including the construction of Heritage City, a 115-hectare suburb that would house most of the nation\u2019s government buildings as well as extensive housing for government workers. The new government, in place since the end of 2014, has loudly rolled out the concept of smart cities, which it prescribes as a \u201ccure all\u201d for everything from a sagging construction sector to a means of attracting highly trained foreign workers and their capital. The label is currently associated with half a dozen (unbuilt) projects on the island, of which Heritage City is the only one the government is spending large sums of public cash on. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to make new cities, we need to make our cities smarter,\u201d says Aadil Ameer Meea, one of seven socialist MPs who form the official opposition after a recent election routed the ruling labour party. Meea, who represents a district in the capital, says that instead of putting money into new developments such as Heritage City, Port Louis itself needs to be refurbished and upgraded.     Though not officially part of Cybercity, the headquarters of the Mauritian Commercial Bank took its inspiration from the planned community    While much political discussion is focused on where Mauritius would get money for the new, ambitious project \u2013 the government is proposing covering a good part of the projected \u00a3563 million construction costs by taking a loan from Saudi Arabia \u2013 observers warn of the lessons learned from Cybercity. \u201cOf course we are inspired by what has been done elsewhere \u2013 we are not inventing the wheel,\u201d says Gaetan Siew, who chairs a technical committee that certifies these smart-city projects, bestowing them with hefty tax breaks and other incentives. While the other projects are less ambitious in scope than Heritage City and Cybercity, and are privately funded, they all are decentralised enclaves that focus on a \u201clive, work, play\u201d concept, green electricity and services. According to Siew, just as Heritage City is centred around government, other smart city projects are meant to be linked to other themes, creating liveable \u201cknowledge hubs\u201d. \u201cDensity is linked to sustainability,\u201d he adds. Back in his office in Cybercity, Chetty acknowledges the development\u2019s shortcomings and explains he has a plan in place \u2013 under the title \u201cSmart Community\u201d \u2013 to bring stakeholders together to pay for the creation of community spaces that would allow the various buildings\u2019 denizens to meet, socialise and form an actual community.   Related: Story of cities #43: how Dubai's World Trade Centre sold the city to the world    But Meea points out that market demand seems largely missing from the plan to redevelop the island. Unlike most African countries, Mauritius\u2019s population remains steady. There are roughly 10,000 marriages a year in this tiny country, hinting that barring a massive influx of foreigners, demand for new neighbourhoods will be limited. As commuters still get stuck in morning traffic on the way to the shabby but functional capital, they have plenty of time to ponder the lessons of the island\u2019s landscape. To the right stands an empty sugar field, which if all goes to plan, will soon be the modern, convenient and efficient Heritage City. To the left stands Cybercity, reminding them that buildings do not always make communities, and that urban developments cannot create work for everyone.

This privately financed city project in the heart of occupied West Bank symbolises both a possible future for the beleaguered Palestinian people and a microcosm of the obstacles they face. That it has got this far in a place under military rule for almost half a century, and in the teeth of obstruction, controversy and criticism, is a testament to the vision of its founder and driving force, Basher al-Masri.

She has also made this $1.2bn (\u00a3825m) paean to contemporary urban planning her home, countering a long tradition which dictates that Palestinian women stay with their parents until they marry, after which they move in with their in-laws.

Rawabi: new, modern, clean, high spec and hi-tech. Both represent a break with the past, but their potential is mired in the cyclical violence and political obduracy characteristic of this part of the world. Our tour of Rawabi \u2013 Arabic for \u201chills\u201d \u2013 takes us through the first two city neighbourhoods to be completed since construction began in 2012. Seven hundred apartments have been sold, with the first residents moving in last autumn. Eventually, Rawabi will have a population of 25,000 in the core high-rise city, which could rise to 40,000 with future expansion. The city is an urban planner\u2019s dream, and the antithesis of the noisy, rubbish-strewn chaos of most Palestinian towns. The apartments have spectacular views over the biblical landscape of the West Bank. Birds of prey soar through the golden evening light. From the highest spots, it is possible to see the Mediterranean glinting beyond the Tel Aviv skyline, 25 miles away. Residential blocks are connected by landscaped walkways, communal gardens and squares, with vehicles restricted to outer roads and underground car parks. Power and telecommunications are delivered by underground fibre-optic cables. Children\u2019s play areas, outdoor gym equipment and benches are scattered through each neighbourhood. The apartments are finished to a high specification, with modern kitchens, integral appliances, tiled floors, recessed lighting and communal stores to keep garbage out of sight. Heating and air conditioning is delivered from a central source. Each flat has a balcony or terrace; there are 100 variations of design.     Rawabi\u2019s 12,000-seater amphitheatre. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    The smallest two-bedroom apartments sell for about $65,000. A four-bedroom apartment could cost up to $150,000. A few top-of-the-range penthouse units have higher prices, but in general they are about 25% cheaper than comparable properties in nearby Ramallah, the overcrowded \u2013 and hence overpriced \u2013 economic and political hub of the West Bank. Rawabi\u2019s commercial centre has retail spaces, cafes and restaurants awaiting occupancy. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to convince international brands, like Mango and Zara, to open here,\u201d says Jaradat, noting that, as yet, there are no global chains in the West Bank. The blueprint includes copious office space, a creche, a seven-screen cinema, a convention centre and a hotel.    Rawabi sends a message to the international community. We are not what they are led to believe, a bunch of terrorists  Bashar al-Masri     Several mosques and a church will provide worship space for the population. An industrial zone is situated on the city\u2019s outskirts. One school is built, and another is planned. In a slick marketing centre, potential buyers can inspect scale models of the project, view a 3D promotional movie and consult representatives of Arab banks on finance options. And then there is Rawabi\u2019s jewel: a vast, stunning 12,000-seat outdoor amphitheatre built into the hillside. Here, it is hoped, international artists will perform to audiences attracted to Rawabi from all over the West Bank and beyond. A soccer stadium, water park, all-terrain recreation vehicles, an overhead zipline \u2013 all add up to an ambitious plan to make Rawabi a desirable place to live and a popular destination to visit. But \u2013 especially here \u2013 not everything goes according to plan.     Palestinian-American developer Bashar al-Masri. Photograph: Uriel Sinai/Getty Images    Since Bashar al-Masri embarked on the Rawabi project in 2007, it has consumed every waking moment. \u201cI have a lot more grey hair. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve taken a single day of vacation. Maybe one. One single day. I never turn my mobile off. There have been many happy moments, but also many frustrating moments. It has not been an easy journey.\u201d The Palestinian-American businessman talks of his new city with passion. \u201cThis project sends a clear message. Despite all the obstacles the [Israeli] occupation puts in our way, we are determined to improve our lives and have our own state. \u201cThis is a mega-project, designed first for Palestinians. People stand on the top of the hill here and say: \u2018Wow! This is for us?\u2019 They see other places \u2013 in Dubai, Israel, the UK, America \u2013 on the internet, and now they see it in our own land, built by our own engineers and labourers. It brings national pride \u2013 yes we can, yes we can make a difference, despite all the misery. \u201cAnd Rawabi also sends a message to the international community. We are not what they are led to believe, a bunch of terrorists. We are ready to build our state. Here is the proof.\u201d Ghost town In 2012, ground was broken. By the middle of 2013, 600 apartments had been sold off-plan and another 8,000 people had registered as potential buyers. A year later, the first properties were finished and phase two was well under construction. But by early 2015, Rawabi was a ghost town and Masri was contemplating bankruptcy.     A finalised neighbourhood in the new Palestinian city of Rawabi. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    The issue that drove him and his mega-project to the edge of disaster was water. Masri spent two years trying to secure a dependable and adequate supply. Without it, Rawabi was dead. Israel took control of West Bank water resources almost 50 years ago, when its occupation of Palestinian territories began. Under the Oslo Accords, signed in 1993, a Joint Water Committee (JWC) between Israel and the newly created Palestinian Authority (PA) was set up. The PA allocates water supply within the West Bank, but the amount of water supplied is determined by Israel. Any water deal for Rawabi needed to be agreed by the JWC. But the PA was mostly refusing to deal with the body in protest at the vastly favourable supply of water to Israeli settlements compared to Palestinian towns. Rawabi was dry. \u201cIt was a super-critical two years,\u201d says Masri. \u201cWe were ready to deliver apartments, and we needed $100m from buyers waiting to move in. But we couldn\u2019t move forward.\u201d Construction slowed and hundreds of buyers pulled out. \u201cI really thought we would go bankrupt.\u201d In desperation, Masri appealed to his friends in international business and politics to intervene. One who advocated on behalf of Rawabi was former British prime minister Tony Blair, who would resign as Middle East envoy a few months later. \u201cBlair was a supporter of Rawabi. He\u2019s been here several times, he\u2019s helped clear [political] obstacles,\u201d says Masri.     Tony Blair plants an olive tree at Rawabi in June 2010. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images    The water deal came through in March 2015. \u201cWe were allocated a quota of 300 cubic metres a day. Now, we\u2019re already at the top of the quota, and we need more. But all Palestinian cities have water problems, all are asking for more water,\u201d says Masri. Water was not the only problem. Rawabi is situated in Area A, the 18% of the West Bank that is under Palestinian control. But access to the city lies through Area C, the 60% that is under full Israeli control. Masri had to negotiate for permission to build a road on which trucks could deliver construction materials and cars and buses carry Rawabi workers \u2013 and, eventually, give Rawabi residents access to the rest of the West Bank. \u201cIt was discussed at the White House, with [UN secretary-general] Ban Ki-moon, with everyone. Finally we started digging, putting facts on the ground with this road. Eventually, in 2012, with a lot of international pressure, they gave us a temporary permit for the road, But every year it has to be renewed, or they could close the road,\u201d says Masri. \u201cWe want to make the road permanent, we want to widen it and extend it. We\u2019ve been back and forth for a long time. But I\u2019m hopeful it will be approved in the near future.\u201d     An architect model of Rawabi. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images    The delays took their toll. \u201cBefore, for every unit I had 10 possible buyers. It became hard to find any.\u201d The project is now three years behind schedule and has a funding shortfall of at least $150m, says Masri. But the setbacks and difficulties go beyond the road and water delays. \u201cTo my knowledge, not another city in the world has been financed completely privately \u2013 every single thing from A-Z: sewage, water, schools, telecoms, electricity, roads, religious places. Everything is paid for by us, and we\u2019re not happy with that,\u201d says Masri. In 2008, Masri signed a private-public partnership agreement with the PA, under which the latter would fund the city\u2019s basic infrastructure to the tune of about $140m. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing since then. The PA\u2019s priorities should be not just politics and security but also the economy. I understand they are financially broke but they could have delivered more than moral support.\u201d The PA does not even provide a police presence in the embryonic city. \u201cThey agreed to open a police station five months ago, but they need Israeli permission. Nothing has happened. We wait. Until then, I am the police chief of this city.\u201d At the very least, he says, the PA could have directed international donors to Rawabi. The project was announced just before a conference in Paris in December 2007, at which billions of dollars in aid was pledged to boost the Palestinian economy and state-building projects. \u201cI thought they\u2019d be all over us,\u201d says Masri. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the donor community remains focused on a welfare society in Palestine. But we need to generate long-lasting jobs rather than wait on handouts every month. We don\u2019t want to rely on philanthropy.\u201d Immunity to occupation Masri, 55, was born and raised in Nablus, a major commercial centre of the West Bank and a city which reputedly produced more suicide bombers than any other during the violent years of the second intifada, or uprising. He is a member of one of Palestine\u2019s best-known and wealthiest families; his uncle Munib al-Masri is a prominent businessman and philanthropist, sometimes called the Godfather of Palestine. After studying and working abroad, mainly in the US, Bashar al-Masri returned to the West Bank in the mid-90s at a time when hopes for a lasting settlement to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict were high following the signing of the Oslo Accords.    I want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not?  Bashar al-Masri     But Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem continued, Israeli settlements within the Palestinian territories multiplied, and the prospects of a Palestinian state receded. Masri launched a newspaper and built a successful business \u2013 and thought hard about how to breathe life into the dying Palestinian economy. Slowly his dream of a new city, a new beginning, began to take shape. He drew on the expertise of international planners and architects to flesh out his vision, and secured funding from Qatar to augment his own massive investment. He bought the hilltop site as a deliberate riposte to Israeli settlers who sought out commanding positions for their burgeoning colonies (Palestinian towns and villages are usually found on valley slopes). Key to Masri\u2019s dream was a sustainable city, attracting investment and jobs to the West Bank. His ambition was to lure hi-tech and service industries to the empty office spaces above Rawabi\u2019s shopping mall, where they could take advantage of a relatively low-cost but highly educated and tech-minded young workforce.

It does not need to overcome the hurdles of checkpoints and closures, import and export bans, and the vagaries of the Israeli civil and military authorities which control much of the West Bank. \u201cI want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not? That would be our Marshall Plan.\u201d Rawabi has many critics. Some Palestinians have belittled it as a vanity project for Masri. Some say the cost of housing is way beyond the reach of most Palestinians, for whom a long-term mortgage is impossible. Some worry that the concept of small units for nuclear families or solo dwellers challenges traditional social norms whereby extended families live grouped together, providing mutual care for the old and the young. And some accuse Masri of cosying up to Israel in order to get his project off the ground. These critics say Rawabi risks \u201cnormalising\u201d the Israeli occupation of the West Bank by embarking on such a major venture ahead of securing a Palestinian state. Some say his dealings with the Israeli authorities amount to \u201cwhitewashing\u201d or \u201ccollaboration\u201d. It is true that Masri has negotiated with Israel over the water supply and the road, and that much of the construction materials used to build Rawabi came from Israeli suppliers. But he shrugs off the criticism. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to to their opinion. A lot of things they accuse me of are not true. I don\u2019t see dealing with Israeli companies as wrong \u2013 it\u2019s almost impossible not to deal with Israel. 99.9% of Palestinian homes are built with Israeli cement. You got to any Palestinian shop, and people are buying Israeli ice cream.\u201d \u201cSome people say Rawabi sugarcoats the occupation. I disagree. Rawabi is being built despite the occupation. We expose the occupation by our battle for basic things like water and a road.\u201d     Rawabi resident Mai Alzarou and her nine-month old daughter. Photograph: Harriet Sherwood for the Guardian    He describes some of his critics as \u201ccappuccino leftists\u201d. \u201cWho decides what to boycott and what not to boycott? It\u2019s okay to study at Tel Aviv university but not to buy Israeli cement?\u201d (This is a dig at Omar Barghouti, a founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, who was a student at the institution.) But, Masri concedes, anti-Israel slogans have resonance at a time \u201cwhen Palestinians are being killed in cold blood\u201d. Between October 2015 and March this year, 30 Israelis and two Americans died in a wave of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings by Palestinians. Over the same period, more than 200 Palestinians were killed, the majority while allegedly carrying out attacks. The violence has had an impact on Rawabi, says Masri. \u201cYou can\u2019t market nice new homes in a climate when people are being killed, when there are closures and demolitions [of Palestinian homes by security forces].\u201d    The patterns of Palestinian society are changing  Mai Alzarou     It has also been a setback for Masri\u2019s ambitions to attract tech companies to Rawabi. Despite his overtures, no international businesses have committed to locating in the city. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe did Rawabi the awkward way \u2013 we built a city, then invited [businesses] to come. The norm is to first create jobs, then build a city around them.\u201d But, typically for Masri, he is undeterred. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to do it. All over the world we have friends who are mesmerised by Rawabi. For the first time they see, hear, read, watch the Palestinian people doing something positive. The international community is on our side, not against us.\u201d In the meantime, the development of Rawabi itself has created thousands of jobs \u2013 and, unusually, almost half its workforce is female. This was deliberate. \u201cWomen are equally qualified and super-hardworking. We wanted to empower women in the workplace.\u201d Masri is the father of two daughters in their early 20s. \u201cI see how women can be at a disadvantage, and when the economy is bad, women get the worst part of it. Here, we are trying to build a civilisation, and that requires equality.\u201d More pragmatically, he adds: \u201cAnd young people buying a home here usually need two salaries.\u201d   Related: The story of cities, part 1: how Alexandria laid foundations for the modern world    Mai Alzarou and her family are typical of Rawabi residents. Alzarou, 25, an English teacher, her salesman husband and nine-month-old daughter moved to the city from Bethlehem last autumn. Their three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment was on sale for $120,000, but the Alzarous took advantage of a \u201crent-to-buy\u201d scheme. They are paying $500 a month in rent for two-and-a-half years, and then will pay off the balance with a combination of savings and mortgage. \u201cIn Palestine we usually live in extended families. But not all young people think this is the best way. We wanted our own apartment with new neighbours,\u201d she said. According to Jaradat, typical buyers are in their 30s with young families, with both husband and wife working outside the home in the private sector, well-educated and looking for a new lifestyle among other young families. Among the first 700 families, 10% are Christian compared to 3% in the overall population. \u201cThe patterns of Palestinian society are changing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I bought my apartment, my family didn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not part of our culture, but I\u2019m glad we\u2019re changing that.\u201d How far and how deep the changes go is not known. Is Rawabi a momentous trailblazer or a colossal folly? Masri has no doubt, but others are watching cautiously. \u201cMy vision is not just Rawabi,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not about real estate, this is about change at the grassroots, it\u2019s about empowerment. Rawabi is a pilot project that will start a domino effect. The only question is when.\u201d Does your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?

Almost two-thirds of homes in the Tower, a 50-storey apartment complex in London, are in foreign ownership, with a quarter held through secretive offshore companies based in tax havens, a Guardian investigation has revealed.    Related: 'Tower for the toffs': UK's tallest skyscraper is playground of the rich    The first residents of the landmark development arrived in October 2013, but many of the homes are barely occupied, with some residents saying they only use them for a fraction of the year. The revelations about the Tower are likely to be seized on by campaigners and politicians as the starkest example yet of the housing crisis gripping the capital, in which too many new homes are sold abroad as investments and left largely empty while fewer and fewer young people can afford to buy or even rent in the city. The five-storey \u00a351m penthouse with views across to the Thames to the Palace of Westminster is ultimately owned by the family of former Russian senator Andrei Guriev, a well-placed source has told the Guardian. His family already owns Witanhurst in Highgate, north London, the biggest mansion in London after Buckingham Palace.     St George Wharf in London. Photograph: Hemzah Ahmed    At 23,000sq ft, the Tower penthouse is 24 times larger than the average new three-bedroom home in the UK. It was bought in May 2014 but has yet to be lived in. As part of a lengthy refurbishment, Guriev is understood to be installing a Russian Orthodox chapel that has had to be carried piece by piece up the elevators. Lower down is a \u00a32.7m flat owned by Ebitimi Banigo, a former Nigerian government minister. In 2012, Banigo was crowned king of Okpoama, in the oil-rich Niger delta, at a ceremony attended by the then president, Goodluck Jonathan. In 2005, he was investigated by Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission following the collapse of the All States Trust Bank he chaired. He was later named in the Nigerian senate for owing the bank 15bn naira (\u00a350m). He was not charged with any offence.    Tower graphic   Other owners named in Land Registry records include a Kurdish oil magnate, an Egyptian snack-food mogul, an Indonesian banker, a Uruguayan football manager and a former Formula 1 racing driver. About 131 of the 210 apartments for which title deeds were available are in foreign ownership, analysis suggests. Owners from Singapore told the Guardian they spend as little as two months a year in the flats, which are empty the rest of the time. Meanwhile, town hall records show that nobody is registered to vote at 184 of the homes.  The Tower does not have any affordable housing, which has been placed mainly at the rear of the larger St George Wharf housing development at Vauxhall facing a dual carriageway rather than the river. The extent of the international selloff emerged after the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, pledged to crack down on foreign ownership of new homes, saying he would consider a rule that they must be sold to UK residents only for the first six months of marketing. \u201cThere is no point in building homes if they are bought by investors in the Middle East and Asia,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cI don\u2019t want homes being left empty.\u201d  The prime minister, David Cameron, has also complained about the sale of high-value properties in London to people overseas through anonymous shell companies and announced that such companies will in future be obliged to declare their true beneficial owners. At least 31 of the apartments have been sold to buyers in the far east markets of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and China; 15 were sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates; and others were sold to buyers in Russia, India, Iraq, Qatar and Switzerland. About 15 more appear to have been sold to foreign buyers from China, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria.  A spokesman for the developer St George said: \u201cAlthough some homes in the Tower have overseas owners, it is wrong to suggest that foreign owners dominate the London market. Savills estimated that in 2013-14, non-resident overseas investors accounted for just 7% of the London residential market.\u201d   foreign ownership   The developer said 30% of the overall St George Wharf development is affordable housing, with 389 units built in neighbouring blocks. He added: \u201cThe range of facilities in the Tower, from a concierge to a spa and gym, appeal to all buyers \u2013 UK as well as international.\u201d Forbes magazine estimates Guriev is worth more than $4bn (\u00a32.7bn) and he shares ownership of PhosAgro, Europe\u2019s largest producer of phosphate fertiliser, with Vladimir Litvinenko, a campaign manager for Russia\u2019s president. Guriev appears to have bought the property through a British Virgin Islands company, Arabella Properties. His ownership of the penthouse has been kept such a closely guarded secret that even the building\u2019s managers did not know who owned it. The BVI company that formally owns Guriev\u2019s penthouse gives as its address the Jersey office of Opus Private, a firm of advisers promising a service that \u201cexploits every legitimate opportunity to protect and preserve family wealth\u201d.

Photograph: Ss Mirza/AFP/Getty Images    The low-key response has fuelled speculation that Pakistan may have consented to Mansoor\u2019s killing. On Tuesday the New York Times quoted US officials as saying Islamabad had been informed \u201cin the past few weeks\u201d that Mansoor was being targeted, and that Pakistan provided \u201csome limited help in tracking down\u201d the Taliban leader. If Pakistan has colluded in killing Mansoor, it risks provoking an angry backlash by the Taliban, which have always been careful not to confront the country that hosts them.

Mansoor was roughly 18 miles (30km) away from the Afghan border when he was killed. Khan said he could not confirm whether the Taliban leader really had been killed as the human remains in the car were burned beyond recognition. He said a test would be done against a DNA sample provided by a relative of Mansoor who had come forward to claim the body.     Mullah Akhtar Mansoor was killed in the drone strike.

On Monday, a former foreign minister in the Taliban government in the late 1990s said the killing of Mansoor would strengthen and unify an insurgency that had been fragmenting. Mullah Mohammad Ghous told AP that Mansoor\u2019s death would allow commanders who objected to his leadership to return to the movement. \u201cThis American strike that killed Mullah Akhtar Mansoor might not affect peace talks so much, but if they strike again or if they kill any other leader, then I think we will not see peace talks in my lifetime,\u201d he said.", "title": "Pakistan condemns US drone strike that killed Taliban leader Mansoor", "sentences": ["Records show the passport, under the name of Muhammad Wali, was used to travel to Dubai and Bahrain, with Mansoor often departing from Karachi airport."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-24T17:36:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/united-arab-emirates-illegally-detained-prisoners-state-security", "tags": ["United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "  Related: UAE drops terror charges against US and Canadian businessmen over Libya links    My brother Salim Alaradi, a Libyan-Canadian businessman, has been unjustly kidnapped and detained by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) State Security for over 600 days. They locked me up too: my excruciating detention in UAE\u2019s notorious secret torture prisons lasted for 120 days before I was let go. This pales in comparison to Salim\u2019s imprisonment, which has lasted over five times that, all despite the fact that he\u2019s an innocent family man who committed no crimes.  After 16 months, the UAE prosecution first fabricated charges that my brother had involvement with two organizations involved with the Libyan revolution, entirely based on confessions obtained under torture. However, in March those charges were withdrawn from the court. New much less serious, but still damnable, offenses of taking hostile actions against Libya without the permission of the UAE government were submitted to the court to salvage their case. This time around no evidence was submitted to the court. Unfortunately, my brother Salim and I weren\u2019t the only prisoners of conscience detained by UAE State Security in 2014. Rather, there were 10 of us, all of Libyan origin - including three Americans, two Canadians and a French permanent resident - who were unjustly arrested. For the first 4 months nobody except our captors even knew where we were. After 4 of us were released, in December 2014, the other 6 remained with no explanation for 16 months. After months of agonizing suspense, they have now been thrown into a trial tainted by due process violations, baseless charges and an empty-handed case by the State Security\u2019s prosecution. Salim and I were kidnapped by the UAE State Security on August 28, 2014 in Dubai, and many months passed by before we were given permission by the authorities to inform our loved ones of our whereabouts and wellbeing. By all standards of international law, our detainment was and is illegal. We were subjected to systematic torture, which, apart from being a direct contravention of international law, also is in direct violation of the UAE Constitution itself. I\u2019m still haunted by my brother\u2019s agonizing and blood-curdling screams as he was being tortured down the hall from my cell.  Salim and I were nothing but law abiding residents of the UAE for decades before our kidnapping, and we both benefited from and gave back to UAE society. We were well-respected businessmen and enjoyed good relations with many honourable Emiratis. The UAE is a country we have come to love and respect, and our feelings would not have been changed were it not for the tragic injustice that the UAE State Security has subjected us to.   Related: UAE beat foreign prisoners and gave them electric shocks, evidence shows    When we realized that justice was nowhere to be found, our family did what any family would do and started the now globally-recognized #FreeSalimAlaradi campaign. It started in Canada and has become an international, grassroots call for freedom and justice, catching the attention of organizations like  Amnesty International, which denounced the government\u2019s fabricated charges, as well as the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, who have also raised serious concerns about the egregious mistreatment of my brother. Our family has been overwhelmed with support from large segments of the international community, which has called for the immediate release of my brother from his arbitrary detainment.  More recently, hundreds of people across the globe have been standing in solidarity with our family through social media, demanding that the UAE grant #freedom and #justice on #May30, which is the date when the court reads out my brother\u2019s final and binding verdict.  One thing should be made clear: our campaign has never been against the UAE itself, or its people. Rather, we want to spark internal reform by revealing and raising awareness about the deplorable human rights abuses suffered by many innocent individuals \u2013 including Salim and myself \u2013 at the hands of the UAE State Security, which has been allowed to function with impunity.  If justice prevails, May 30th 2016 marks the day we finally get to see the release and freedom of my brother - a 45-year-old, dedicated, loving husband and father of five - from arbitrary detainment in the UAE.  For months, a dedicated international legal team has defended Salim and his co-accused, American citizens Kamal and Mohamed Eldarat, in the highest court of the UAE against the State Security prosecution, which hasn\u2019t hesitated to obstruct the legal process at every turn. The evidence presented by the highly capable defense team has confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt that, according to the law of the land, there\u2019s really no alternative to an innocent verdict.  For the thousands of advocates who now speak as Salim\u2019s voice, an innocent verdict is the only acceptable outcome. It\u2019s my brother and his family\u2019s only chance to put the pain and suffering of the last 600 or so days behind them. We are not interested in pursuing any further actions against the UAE if justice is served. We just want to bring Salim home. Despite all that\u2019s transpired, we\u2019re still hopeful that justice will prevail and that the UAE will recognize the countless wrongs that\u2019s been inflicted upon my brother. We plead to the government to no longer deprive Salim of his freedom, and are cautiously optimistic that he will soon be reunited with his mother, wife and children.  Even though he can\u2019t ever get back the nearly two years that\u2019s been unjustly wrested away from him, I know in my heart that all my brother wants is the opportunity to go home and rebuild his life with his family.

There is no suggestion from United this could prevent Mourinho becoming Louis van Gaal\u2019s successor. But Woodward is intent on acquiring the rights, or failing that may consider leveraging them by paying a licence fee to Chelsea, since they will provide lucrative income. The issue is expected to be resolved and Mourinho should sign a three-year deal with United worth in excess of the \u00a37.5m he earned annually while at Stamford Bridge.

People took to the streets on Wednesday accusing the authorities of corruption and violence linked to plans to redevelop a popular area of Belgrade. The rally was organised by the Ne Davimo Beograd (Don\u2019t Drown Belgrade) movement, which opposes a \u20ac2.7bn deal with an Abu Dhabi-based developer to transform part of Belgrade into an upscale housing and shopping complex. Demonstrators took aim in particular at an incident on 24 April in the arts and nightlife district of Savamala, where several buildings were demolished in the night by mysterious masked men.  Wearing balaclavas and driving vehicles without number plates, the men allegedly bound onlookers and took their mobile phones while bulldozers razed the buildings, according to local media reports. One of the witnesses to the demolitions, Slobodan Tanaskovic, later died in hospital. Serbian ex-president Boris Tadic, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party, called for an urgent probe into the death of the 58-year-old. The Beta news agency said the cause of death had not been disclosed. Protesters called for the resignation of various police, government and city officials over the demolitions, which cleared part of the way for the Belgrade Waterfront redevelopment. \u201cIt is unacceptable that a month after the incident we don\u2019t know who is responsible for violence against citizens.

Walking through the Roman Great Colonnade to the Temple of Bel, with the sun setting and the stones turning gold and pink in the desert light, you felt a deep connection across the centuries to the city\u2019s heyday.  When Isis fighters stormed Palmyra and destroyed some of the most precious parts of this ancient city, the world was aghast. Then came the surprise, now unveiled in Trafalgar Square: a faithful, 3D-printed replica of the Triumphal Arch of the Temple of Bel, which Isis had reduced to rubble.  It turns out that while Isis was advancing on the city, the Institute of Digital Archaeology (IDA) had, along with Unesco, been distributing 3D cameras to volunteers in Palmyra. They were aware that in the same way the Taliban blew up the sixth-century Buddha statues in Bamiyan, Afghanistan in 2001, Isis were very likely to destroy much of Palmyra\u2019s ancient heritage.  Boris Johnson called it giving \u201ctwo fingers to Daesh\u201d, but this remarkable new capability \u2013 to rebuild exact copies of urban structures \u2013 goes much further. From Palmyra to the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, new technologies in digital copying and 3D building are allowing us to bring back not just monuments, but entire cities from the rubble.     A photograph published by Isis of the destruction of the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, Syria ...       ... and London mayor Boris Johnson standing in front of the replica of Palmyra\u2019s Arch of Triumph in April of 2016. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images    The technology raises difficult questions. What does it mean to copy an ancient monument or building? Can a reproduction ever be as good as the original? Or is \u201cauthenticity\u201d less important than symbolism to people who\u2019ve survived death and destruction? There is, in fact, a long history of copying urban structures. You can get a good sense of it inside the V&amp;A\u2019s Cast Courts \u2013 vast halls full of plaster and electrotyped replicas of arches, doorways, statues and metalwork. The main room is dominated by a massive reproduction of Trajan\u2019s Column, which is so big they had to cut it in half to fit inside the building. \u201cThe Victorians were more concerned with showing the broader public the fullest breadth of art and architecture from across the world,\u201d says Brendan Cormier, who is curating the V&amp;A\u2019s special pavilion at this year\u2019s Venice Biennale. A World in Fragile Parts explores how copying can mitigate the threats \u2013 from terrorism to natural disasters \u2013 facing heritage cities like Palmyra. \u201cIf you wanted to communicate to the average British citizen in the 19th century the greatness of Trajan\u2019s Column, you would have to find a way of representing Trajan\u2019s Column.\u201d           Palmyra\u2019s Arch of Triumph: the making of a London replica.    The most famous attempt at rebuilding an entire city exactly as it was, however, is undoubtedly Warsaw after the second world war. In 1945, more than 90% of the city had been damaged or destroyed. City authorities set out to rebuild the old city \u2013 not anew, nor even how it looked on the eve of war, but as Warsaw stood during its \u201cgolden age\u201d of the late 18th century. To do so, they relied not just on historic plans but also on a series of paintings by the Venetian painter Bernardo Bellotto, a nephew and pupil of Canaletto.  Bellotto wasn\u2019t averse to improving on reality: a remodelled church here, an altered facade there. These idealised views were used as the inspiration for Warsaw\u2019s rebuilding \u2013 and the results were so successful that many visitors do not realise they are walking through a version of the city made to seem as if the 20th century had never happened. What was important to the survivors was the symbolism, however, and the resurrection of Warsaw remains a point of national pride. \u201cPart of the wonder of the historic centre of Warsaw is knowing it was rebuilt, and thinking about the incredible skill it must have taken, and the resilience and strength of the people who rebuilt it,\u201d says Emma Cunliffe of Blue Shield, a charity working to protect archaeological sites from conflict and natural disaster.     Warsaw, which was in ruins at the end of the second world war, was rebuilt using (idealised) paintings by Bernardo Bellotto. Photograph: Sovfoto/UIG via Getty Images    The slow rebuilding of Palmyra will not rely on paintings, but on the Million Image Database, a photo resource created by the IDA with funding from the Oxford Department of Physics. Based on photographs taken by volunteers given special cameras, the IDA is able to build a digital model of a building. From this, a rough structure is printed in artificial stone (or even natural stone for smaller objects). Surface detail is added through a 3D carving technique. The availability of open-source 3D software to simplify what used to be painstakingly difficult has also allowed communities under threat to play a crucial role themselves, without waiting for help from international organisations. The NewPalmyra is one such initiative. Inspired by Bassel Khartabil \u2013 a Palestinian-Syrian software developer who had played a key role in pioneering open access data in Syria \u2013 this grassroots project creates 3D models based on crowd-sourcing and open data.      The original Temple of Bel was destroyed by Isis, but it was preserved in digital form, and could be rebuilt. Photograph: #NewPalmyra Project    Khartabil was the recipient of an Index on Censorship Digital Freedom Award for his efforts to promote a free internet in the country. He has been held by the Syrian regime for four years. His current location and state of health remain unknown. \u201cSharing and creation of derivative works is core to our mission,\u201d says Barry Threw, who is interim director of the project until Khartabil\u2019s release. \u201cInstead of spending resources constructing the ruins in Trafalgar Square, we make our 3D models downloadable, so that anyone can print them.\u201d Similarly, when an earthquake wrecked central Kathmandu in April of 2015, $4.1bn was pledged by international donors for reconstruction, and an organisation called Rekrei stepped up. Previously engaged in Project Mosul, which creates 3D models of items in Iraq\u2019s Mosul Museum \u2013 some of which will also be featured in the V&amp;A\u2019s pavilion at the Venice Biennale \u2013 Rekrei began attempting digital reconstructions of the World Heritage-listed Durbar Square in the middle of Kathmandu. Unlike Warsaw or Palmyra, however, there were very few plans from which to rebuild Kathmandu. Much of the information did not exist prior to the disaster; Nepal\u2019s Department of Archaeology held few plans for the some 220 monuments destroyed in the earthquake.  Instead, they have relied on crowdsourced images, which were sorted by volunteers and fed into the photogrammetric modelling program Sketchfab to reconstruct the geometry of the lost buildings. Meanwhile, in an attempt to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d Nepal\u2019s heritage, a new organisation called the Digital Archaeology Foundation has been using 3D cameras to collect data on damaged and surviving temples and stupas, in order to create an open-access digital resource that could be relied on the next time disaster strikes. The first structure that could actually be rebuilt is Ranipokhari, a 17th-century royal temple complex, with reconstruction expected to take six months and costing 120m Nepali rupees (\u00a3776,000).     Bassel Khartabil, a pioneer of open data, at Palmyra in 2005. His whereabouts are now unknown Photograph: #NewPalmyra    The sky, it seems, is the limit. The latest wheeze is a proposal by Richard Cameron and James Grimes of Atelier &amp; Co to rebuild New York\u2019s lost Beaux-Arts Penn Station, destroyed in 1963, by combining the original plans with 3D printing technology. As the technology becomes more commonplace, the IDA is hosting a conference at Harvard in September with Unesco to try to reach a consensus on global guidelines for reconstruction, and the V&amp;A have similar plans next year to coordinate a convention on artefact copying. As for the Palmyra arch, it will tour to New York and Dubai, and by the autumn is set to be installed in Palmyra itself, now that Isis have been ejected. Syria\u2019s antiquities chief has boldly claimed that everything Isis has destroyed in Palmyra could be rebuilt in as little as five years. \u201cOur hope and expectation is that the military situation in Syria will continue to resolve itself over the next few months, producing ever greater security and safety for the people who live and work there,\u201d says the IDA\u2019s director Roger Michel.    Related: Story of cities #28: how postwar Warsaw was rebuilt using 18th century paintings    It\u2019s a big if. Reconstruction will certainly have trouble proceeding during a civil war and humanitarian crisis, and rebuilding Syria as a whole will take far longer \u2013 if it is possible at all. When peace does finally come, however, some hope that the new digital technologies can play a small but important role in preserving certain elements of a country whose heritage has been destroyed along with its people. For a 2,000-year-old city like Palmyra, its recent suffering under Isis will be one scar in a much longer story, but one that conservationists say is important to display. \u201cIf we do rebuild something, we can also incorporate what has happened to that site, and how it has affected people, remembering those who died, and who lost something,\u2019 says Cunliffe. \u201cThose stories become just as important in the history of the site.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "title": "Erasing Isis: how 3D technology now lets us copy and rebuild entire cities", "sentences": ["As for the Palmyra arch, it will tour to New York and Dubai, and by the autumn is set to be installed in Palmyra itself, now that Isis have been ejected."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-27T07:10:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/south-asian-migrants-body-bags-deportation-us", "tags": ["US immigration", "US news", "Bangladesh", "World news", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "A group of south Asian migrants have said they were forcefully placed in \u201cbody bags\u201d and shocked with Tasers by Immigration and Customers Enforcement (ICE) officers as they were being deported from the US, allegations that have raised red flags for advocates and immigration attorneys.  On 3 April, 85 Bangladeshis, Nepalis and Indians were repatriated on an ICE charter flight that departed from Mesa, Arizona, after they failed to gain asylum or otherwise secure legal status.  Seven detainees who had been on the flight, have detailed their claims of abuse by ICE to the Guardian. According to those interviewed, about 15 deportees were placed in what they called body bags, believed to refer to the \u201crestraint\u201d or \u201csecurity\u201d blankets occasionally used by the agency. Some individuals were also said to have been shocked with a Taser, an allegation which ICE denies.   Related: Detainees in ICE raids speak out as lawyers scramble to stop deportations    According to detainees who witnessed the bags being used, to place a detainee in a so-called body bag, a group of ICE officers would first pin them to the ground, sometimes face-down. The detainee\u2019s body would then be tightly wrapped in the security blanket and fastened with a series of Velcro belts. Limbs restrained, the deportee could then be carried on to the plane. In a phone interview, 29-year-old Suhel Ahmed, described witnessing his fellow detainees being forcefully placed in the body bags.  \u201cThat\u2019s something that made us really afraid,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cAnd me and a lot of fellow detainees started crying and begging [the ICE officers] not to do the same thing to us \u2013 we told them, \u2018we\u2019ll walk, \u2018we\u2019ll walk\u2019 [on to the plane].\u201d In an email, an ICE official said ICE officers had used \u201cminimal force\u201d during boarding after \u201capproximately a dozen of the detainees refused to comply with officers\u2019 instructions and became combative.\u201d In a subsequent email, ICE added that restraint blankets can be used \u201cin exigent circumstances where transporting officers determine they are necessary to ensure officer and detainee safety, as was the case in this instance.\u201d About 235,000 people were deported by ICE last year. Charter flights are sometimes used when a large number of detainees are being returned to the same region. Since charter flights happen behind closed doors, and deportees have little contact with not-for-profit organizations or lawyers once they return home, it is difficult to determine whether such accounts of force are a rarity, said advocates and lawyers.  \u201cI actually don\u2019t know,\u201d said Paromita Shah, the associate director of the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, when asked how frequently ICE engages in this kind of conduct during removals. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if any of us do.\u201d \u201cThese allegations, if true, are extremely troubling and must be investigated,\u201d Shah added. Immigrant rights advocates have previously referred to ICE as a \u201crogue\u201d agency. In 2007, the agency was sued for forcibly sedating people during deportations, a policy it subsequently modified. This year, civil liberties groups have documented ICE\u2019s apparent unwillingness to address deaths in immigration detention or the abuses endured by transgender women held in their facilities. In what an agency spokesperson said was standard ICE practice, all 85 detainees were handcuffed, and placed in waist and ankle chains, from the time they left the detention center until after they landed in Dhaka \u2013 a period of over 30 hours, according to those interviewed. Several deportees also said that being shackled for so long had left heavy bruising on their wrists and ankles, in some cases for weeks.  Despite ICE\u2019s claim that their officers used \u201cminimal force\u201d, the detainees interviewed said that many people were bleeding or had other visible injuries as a result of what occurred when they were being loaded on to the plane. Some detainees said that ICE officers had punched and kicked people, whereas other detainees said the officers were very forceful but did not cause intentional harm.  Didar Alam, 29, one of the people who alleges he was placed in a security blanket, said he resisted the removal because he feared he would be killed if returned to Bangladesh, or put the safety of his family at risk. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back, please don\u2019t send me,\u201d he recalled tearfully telling the ICE officers when they placed him in his seat. Alam is a member of the Bangladeshi National Party (BNP), which has a longstanding rivalry with the ruling Awami League (AL). Since the 2014 elections, the AL has been accused of engaging in extrajudicial killings, \u201cenforced disappearances\u201d and mass arrests as a means of repressing political dissent. BNP activists have been frequent targets of the violence, which is why Alam \u2013 and most of the other men interviewed \u2013 came to the US to claim asylum. Suhel Ahmed said he saw four detainees being given \u201celectric shocks\u201d \u2013 presumably referring to the use of a Taser \u2013 as they resisted being wrapped in the security blankets, even though those detainees were already cuffed. Three other men interviewed also stated they witnessed people being given electric shocks by weapons that looked akin to guns.  \u201cMy body was shaking [in fear],\u201d said Ahmed, of watching people being shocked. An ICE official denied the Taser allegation in an email to the Guardian, stating that neither ICE deportation officers nor the third-party staff present used them. The use of the device is expressly permitted in ICE\u2019s use of force policy, but the agency official said ICE officers were not issued them.  For the men interviewed, the events of 3 April formed part of another traumatic phase in an already perilous journey. Atif Ahsan, 26, said he flew from Bangladesh to Dubai to Brazil, then travelled to the US on foot or hidden in shipping containers, a trip facilitated by traffickers that cost him $26,000. Once on US soil, the men \u2013 who travelled separately \u2013 were immediately detained. Over the fall several of the men participated in hunger strikes to protest about their treatment. Ahsan requested a pseudonym out of fear local AL party members, or Bangladesh\u2019s secret police, might track him down.  Several detainees said there were hundreds of ICE officers present during the removals, and that many were laughing or swearing at the deportees as the scene unfolded, even filming it on their phones. Fahd Ahmed, the executive director of Drum, an New York-based immigrants\u2019 rights organization which arranged and provided translation for four of the detainee interviews, said: \u201cTrump talks about building walls or banning Muslims \u2026 while the Obama administration is preventing refugees, Muslims and others from seeking safety here, violently abusing such migrants, and then colluding with other governments to deport them back to their deaths.\u201d Back in Bangladesh, many of the men deported in April remain in hiding and fear for their lives.  \u201cWhen I came to the US I had a dream \u2013 this is the country of peace and justice and human rights,\u201d said Khaled Miah, 36, describing why he had taken the dangerous trek.  \u201cNow, I don\u2019t even want to say the word, \u2018America\u2019.\u201d Belal Hossain Biplob contributed reporting from Bangladesh.

(scottcf)  Isfahan, Iran  Isfahan reached its zenith when Abbas I of Persia moved his capital to the city, turning it into one of the most populated and prosperous cities of the time. Abbas I undertook ambitious urban development and design projects, which resulted in the creation of beautiful boulevards, covered bridges, palaces, mosques and even bathhouses. One of these projects was the 90,000m squared Naqsh-e Jahan Maidan, which is still one of the largest squares in the world. Toward the end of the 16th and 17th centuries, Isfahan became an international city. With over 1,800 caravanserais (traditional inns), Isfahan played host to merchants traveling between China and the Ottoman cities, and Russia and the Persian Gulf. With almost 50 religious colleges, Isfahan became the centre of Shia scholarship but it was also famed for its painters, silk crafters, metalwork and ceramics. Isfahan was known as \u2018half of the world\u2019 \u2013 a nickname bestowed upon it by a French tourist. It became a model for urban development in other cities like Hyderabad, India, which was known as \u2018new Isfahan\u2019. Contemporary Isfahan, the third most populated city in Iran, has been at the centre of a debate around urban modernisation for years. For 1,500 years Isfahan has repeatedly experienced political and cultural upheavals. But today\u2019s urban youths are trying harder than ever to hold on preserve its ancient heritage while turning it into an international metropolis again.

Then invasions by the Soviets, the Nazis, then the Soviets again, devastated the population, wiping out almost all the Jews and sending many Lithuanians to the gulag. Since gaining independence 25 years ago, Lithuania has been struggling with this past and trying to find a way to rebrand the \u2018second city\u2019 and counter mass emigration to western Europe. The city recently elected a new mayor and green shoots are showing. (Mark Adam Harold, International Centre for Litvak Photography, via email)  Bergamo, Italy  The city on the hill, its suburbs connected to it \u2018like fingers to the palm of an open hand\u2019. This was one of the first descriptions of Bergamo in 1516, told by the man of letters and Venetian art collector Marcantonio Michiel a few decades before the construction of the Venetian walls.  The close link with orography, already evoked in 1483 by Marin Sanudo with his \u2018city situated on a most wonderful mountain\u2019, is referred to as part of the distinctive character of the city. A powerful metaphor, which employs the \u2018simplicity\u2019 of human anatomy to convey the complex territorial relations on which the city was structured. But soon after, with the construction of the city walls between 1561 and 1590, that character would be lost. The construction of new walls helped to create a different image of the city. It was an episode full of consequences for the history of Bergamo and its urban shape, and laid the foundations for the idea of the old town centre as the \u2018upper city\u2019, which is still widely held to this day.

It is a relatively young city, established by Emperor Menelik in 1800s, but has recently opened its new light rail system.

Manzoni was keen to tackle Birmingham\u2019s slums, and although his diagnosis was correct, his remedy \u2013 huge numbers of tower blocks \u2013 was not. He also transformed the city centre, building the inner and middle ring roads through historic neighbourhoods and demolishing many Victorian civic buildings including the original Central Library and the Bull Ring Market Hall. Noticeably many of the buildings that replaced them were themselves demolished inside 50 years.

(savale)  Belgrade, Serbia  Over the years, apart from sport success, Serbia has developed quite a negative image in the western media, leaving its capital\u2019s rich history somewhat neglected. Regardless, I think that Belgrade has a fascinating story to tell.  Starting in the neothlithic times, Vin\u010da (Vincha), a suburb of Belgrade, was one of the biggest settlements in the region. Over time due to its geographical position, on the hill overlooking the confluence of two rivers (Danube and Sava), Belgrade became a popular spot for setting up military camps and fortresses, making it a military outpost for centuries to come. Its rule changed many times \u2013 from Celts, to Franks, Byzantines, Hungarians, Bulgarians, Ottomans, and Serbs. In the middle ages, it was a border post between two major civilisations: the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Belgrade has developed a very unique culture of \u2018survival\u2019 under various regimes. It often suffered, and it was destroyed and re-built over 40 times in its history.

(@TayianaC) April 19, 2016    Dunedin, New Zealand  If you want to see the consequences of imposing a grid system on a hilly city go to Dunedin, which boasts the world\u2019s steepest navigable street, Baldwin Street, in North East Valley. The valley in question is long, narrow and bounded by steeply rising ridges. A planner in London reputedly doubted the measurements of the rude colonials and imposed a grid system regardless. It works much better in the flat part of the central city and over in the former salt marsh of South Dunedin. It\u2019s just North East Valley where it went wrong. (Muscleguy)  Filadelfia, Italy  The town called Filadelfia in Calabria, Italy, was named by a Catholic bishop in explicit homage to Pennsylvania\u2019s capital in 1783. It is also built on a regular grid, and embellished by four squares. (Luca Peliti)  Rijeka, Croatia  Croatia\u2019s third largest city is so small that most Europeans probably would not have heard of it. Those who have may know it under a different, Italian name \u2013 Fiume \u2013 with both names meaning \u2018river\u2019. In its 19th-century heyday, Rijeka/Fiume was a multicultural port for the Hungarian end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a corpus separatum of the Hungarian crown, as it was on all sides surrounded by territory belonging to the Austrian side of the Empire. One can still find Rijeka\u2019s coat of arms on the lavish building of the Hungarian Parliament, and on other public buildings around Budapest. The late 19th century was a time of growth, entrepreneurship, migration, and industry. Land was reclaimed from the sea, the port was expanded, and public buildings were erected where there was once no more than beaches. The city was deeply international in ethnic composition, as the Italians, Hungarians, Croats, and many others arrived wanting to take part in the expansion. In this period, the city had one of the first industrial-scale oil refineries in Europe, and could boast the creation of the world\u2019s first torpedo. The port served the industry of the Empire, and the migration to America. The most famous ship to travel that American route was the Carpathia, going from Rijeka to New York and back, remembered for being the first ship that came to Titanic\u2019s rescue. The end of the first world war, though, changed things radically. The city was demanded by Italy as part of its war spoils, and the collapsing Austria-Hungary was unable to fight for it. The representatives of the southern Slavs wanted to create a state from the Slovenian and Croatian-populated parts of Austria-Hungary, Bosnia, and Serbia, and while many of their demands were heeded at the post-war peace conference, there was no solution for multi-ethnic and contested Rijeka. The matter was bitterly fought, and the final decision was to create an independent city state, a solution that no one was particularly happy with. The city itself was divided, and the east side of the river in the city centre remained in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which would soon become known as Yugoslavia.      The harbour of Rijeka, Croatia\u2019s third-largest city. Photograph: Damir Spanic/Getty Images     Independence only lasted a couple of months, and was replaced by one of European history\u2019s oddest episodes, when the city was stormed and taken over by Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio, Italian poet and proto-fascist revolutionary, and his armed supporters. The city was run as a revolutionary experiment, driving the economy to ruin and exacerbating the political and ethnic divisions. D\u2019Annunzio and his fighters established the Italian Regency of Carnaro (named after the bay area Rijeka is in), but were more interested in revolutionary politics, poetry, and parties, than actually running a city state. Even though D\u2019Annunzio and his men were expelled from the city after a year by Italian bombing, the city\u2019s fate remained tied to the fascists, as independence in name only got replaced by annexation by Italy in 1924. The river dividing the city became the border of Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.  During the second world war, the city was occupied by German forces, and finally liberated by Croatian anti-fascists on 3 May 1945. Upon liberation, the bulk of its fascist and anti-communist citizens left, as did most of its Italians. The new communist Yugoslavia tried to restore the city\u2019s industrial legacy, with mixed results. Similarly, the rebuilding process was patchy, with visible wartime scars on the city streets. The war in 1990s Croatia and the transition into the market economy and democratic politics precipitated the decline of the industrial economy, but did not cause physical destruction. If anything, the area was rid of military complexes. What were once military installations are now university grounds \u2013 an old military command building is now the Academy for Applied Arts. The current city is built on legacies of all the totalitarian regimes that tore it apart, the shadows of those who left, the contributions of those who remained and those who arrived after the second word war in search of work. Hence the unusual, Italian-like-but-not-quite, intonation in the way we speak, the remains of Italian and Venetian vocabulary in our own, a handful of bilingual schools, and architectural features that clearly bear the marks of the empires that built them. As for the relevance of the city, the industry has waned and near-disappeared, replaced by hopes for a university-driven and culture-fuelled economy. The future looks uncertain, but definitely more peaceful than the past. (Sanja Badanjak, via email)  Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong  I\u2019m going to suggest the story of the Kowloon Walled City, at its height a political exclave, lawlessly run by the triads. All of its water and electricity was basically illegally piped. It was the most densely populated city in the world with 33,000 within two and a half hectares. Full of factories, illegal dentists\u2019 clinics, butchers, brothels, drug dens, it was demolished in the 1990s and is now a park! (Phyllis Katrina Chan)  Portland, Maine, US  Portland suffered its \u2018Great Fire\u2019 in 1866, claimed by many to be the largest urban conflagration sustained in the still-young nation. It destroyed most of the downtown, including nearly 2,000 structures, and displaced 10,0000 residents, even though only two people were reported killed in the blaze. Reconstruction rapidly followed the removal of much debris, including a great volume of the ruined brick masonry. Debris by the thousands of cartloads was drawn downhill to the waterfront along the shore of the peninsula on which the city had been founded. Much of this debris in the immediate downtown was wasted within the arc of a new rail line in the harbour. The disposal filled much of the lagoon created between the rail line (founded largely on timber pilings just off shore) and the original edge of the harbour, in water that had become too shallow to serve many of the ocean-going vessels of the day.  This new rail line connected the two principle railway systems converging on and serving the busy harbour of Portland. This connection carried traffic until the 1980s when the rail line was taken up, the occasional train progressing slowly down the middle of the street coming to be considered as impediment to economic redevelopment of the by then largely somnolent, but just reawakening, waterfront.       Lobster boats and wharves on the waterfront in Portland, Maine. Photograph: Robert F. Bukaty/AP     New warehouses and piers were constructed along the rail bed soon after its creation. The arc of the track shaped and prompted the construction of a wide vehicular way, aptly named Commercial Street, to serve these commercial and harbour-side facilities. Infilling the lagoon also created above sea-level real estate, immediately recognised as highly desirable for exploitation by industrial and commercial interests too tightly constrained within the previous limits of the city along its harbour. Today, the shape of Portland, particularly its waterfront along the harbour, and its vigorous redevelopment in recent decades, arises directly from the construction of the track more than a century and a half ago. (gterrien)  Sydney, Australia  I recall reading about the Department of Main Roads in Sydney working and conspiring with land owners to corner the state government of the day into dismantling the \u2018green belt\u2019 that used to exist around Sydney. This \u2018green belt\u2019 was modelled on the one around London (I believe) and was supposed to provide protection against unadulterated sprawl which was feared at the time, thus consuming all the fertile farmlands that surrounded Sydney. My recollection of the story was the the DMR built roads where they weren\u2019t allowed to \u2013 but encouraged by land owners \u2013 and basically said well now we have roads you may as well let land owners subdivide their properties ... this commenced the great Sydney land grab of the 1920s. (butlerad)  Merv, Turkmenistan  Merv was once at the heart of the ancient Silk Road connecting European markets with China. Today, only its ruins remain in Turkmenistan\u2019s Mary province. The city first came to prominence under the Arabs in the 7th century, when it served as a base for Islam\u2019s expansion into central Asia. Then, in 1037, the Seljuk Turks took over the city. It is during this period that Merv expanded rapidly and became known as \u2018the mother of the world\u2019. Merv is thought to have been the largest city in the world from AD1145 to 1153, with a population of 200,000. However, with prosperity came tragedy. In 1221, Merv opened its gates to Tolui, son of Genghis Khan \u2013 chief of the Mongols \u2013 and the majority of its inhabitants were killed. Modern historians agree that the event was one of the bloodiest occupations in history. Merv was never again to regain its splendour, and following over a century of Russian, and then Soviet dominion, faded into obscurity. (Bradley Jardine, via email)      Merv\u2019s Kiz-Kala fortress, Turkmenistan. Photograph: Targa/Getty Images/age fotostock RM    Muscat, Oman  With the rise of cities like Dubai and Doha, impressive skylines and iconic architecture have become synonyms for urban development in the Gulf Region. Muscat, the capital city of Oman, chose to follow a different path. Despite the fact that its economic \u2018renaissance\u2019 since the 1970s is also based on money generated by fossil fuels, urban planning was guided by social welfare ideals. A land allocation system grants every Omani citizen, female and male alike, a plot of land.  In parallel to demographic growth, the Sultanate faced rapid urbanisation. Over the last 50 years the metropolitan area has grown to an extended urban region of over 100km in length. The former coastal town and mountain oasis have amalgamated into a vast desert sprawl threatening agricultural land and fragile ecosystems. Even though Oman is taking a different path than the countries surrounding it, it has yet to become a model of sustainable spatial development.

Her boys have extraordinary reasons to be busy. The last time the whole family was crowded into the living room, her middle son was celebrating winning the Sword of Honour at Sandhurst, his younger brother was between performances with the Royal Ballet and his older brother, an artist, was back from a sell-out residency in Dubai. Raised in a Tottenham council house, all troublemakers at school, the three have gone on to penetrate some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions: Solomon, 22, is the first black British male dancer in the Royal Ballet, Kidane, 24, rose through basic army training to graduate with the top prize at the Royal Military Academy in April and Amartey, 27, has the patronage of the Dubai royal family. The brothers credit their mother with bringing them up to believe that the world was theirs for the taking. \u201cI never felt that being disadvantaged was how I was defined,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cWe are fiercely proud \u2013 we didn\u2019t feel like these institutions were worlds away. No one should have to stay in their lane or accept their lot. We travelled, we heard stories of such rich experiences and history.\u201d     Maryam Golding.    Maryam is an African historian, social worker and practising Rastafarian (as well as the three brothers she also has a daughter and another son still at home). It was her passion for art and dance that inspired Amartey and Solomon and her iron discipline that convinced Kidane the\u00a0army could never be tougher than\u00a0home. \u201cHe said the woman sergeant-major wasn\u2019t as scary as me,\u201d says Maryam. Kidane rolls his eyes. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a sergeant-major. She was a bombardier. Yeah, it\u2019s true though.\u201d Though other newspapers have told the story of her sons, Maryam has stayed out of the limelight until now and contacted the Guardian. She says she has decided to speak out because she feels part of their story has been overlooked \u2013 how mixed-race, working-class young men like them are so often discriminated against and demonised. This is not the simple story of bad boys being made good by the discipline of the army or a dance company. \u201cWe raised them conscious of their identities,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spoke about Ethiopia\u2019s history as an independent kingdom which had never been colonised. They loved The Three Musketeers so we spoke about how Alexandre Dumas was mixed race. You drop it in \u2013 you don\u2019t sit them down and explain it. Each of my children has taken it to different paths.\u201d Born in south London and expelled twice from convent schools, Maryam spent her 20s as a community worker, working with women and girls in Tottenham, north London. When the funding was cut, she went to the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) to study African history. Her father had served in the Royal Artillery during the second world war and later ran a newspaper in Ethiopia, where he had an audience with Haile Selassie. The emperor made a lasting impression on him, something Maryam absorbed; and she in turn was determined to bring up her children with an understanding of their heritage as mixed-race British children.    When you\u2019re mixed race, to know the black culture and history you have inside of you is really important and really rich  Kidane Cousland     On the walls and shelves of the family home, as well as Amartey\u2019s prints and photographs of Solomon in his leotard, are treasures from their travels to Jamaica and their years in Ghana. \u201cWhen you\u2019re mixed race, living in London \u2013 and you do have to face a lot of prejudice \u2013 to know the black culture and history you have inside of you is also really important and really rich, it allows you to develop a strong identity,\u201d says Kidane. Despite their rich cultural life, the family often had very little. \u201cIt was secondhand market clothes. I used to make them African outfits with knitted hats,\u201d says Maryam. All three boys were exceptionally close to her Jamaican husband, Ras I Golding. Though their biological father was Ghanaian, Golding is the man they consider their dad and also the father of their two youngest siblings. All have taken his surname except Kidane, who uses Maryam\u2019s maiden name, Cousland. Golding died in 2009 and all three boys cite him as a major influence on their chosen paths. When the children were young, the family moved to Jamaica and later Ghana, where Amartey and Kidane say they experienced a different kind of racism. \u201cIn Ghana, they would call us white. And you realise you\u2019re not black or white \u2013 you just have to roll with it. From a young age, you realise people try to put you in boxes and we don\u2019t fit. So we made our own boxes.\u201d     Kidane Cousland was awarded the Sword of Honour at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in April 2016. Photograph: Cpl Jamie Dudding/Army    Back in the UK, it was tough for the family who spent time living in a bug-infested bed and breakfast, while the three boys struggled in mainstream education. Amartey moved away from the family to the YMCA in Cambridge and later went to art school \u2013 Central Saint Martins in London \u2013 and Solomon joined the Royal Ballet School. Kidane was 16 and in the marine cadets, about to resit his GCSEs, when he joined the army. \u201cAt school, I wasn\u2019t the best at anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI found the knack to soldiering was being prepared to work harder than anyone else. Work harder, endure more cold or crawl into the nastiest smelling bush to hide, that would be success. And I was always prepared to go through more agony than anyone else. If that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a calling or a passion, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he says.     Solomon Golding rehearsing with the Royal Ballet. Photograph: Royal Opera House    \u201cI knew that I didn\u2019t have the academic background to be an officer \u2013 I was heavily dyslexic. So I thought, I\u2019ll join and get commissioned from the\u00a0ranks, like Sharpe. I watched a lot of Sharpe.\u201d Though very much now a model soldier, a sharp dresser with closely cropped hair, a stark contrast to three of his siblings\u2019 and mother\u2019s Rastafarian dreads, Kidane says he has not compromised the values he was brought up with. \u201cI think it has been about wanting to succeed on my own terms. I have been vegetarian my entire career, even though people expressed concern about that, through arduous physical training courses, commando training, in a six-month-tour of Afghanistan, not just keeping up but being better.\u201d For his mother, to watch him be admitted and then excel at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst has been \u201cbittersweet, if I\u2019m honest\u201d, Maryam admits. \u201cI\u2019m still conflicted. I was worried, of course, when he went into the officer training. Discrimination in that class structure can be more insidious because it\u2019s not, \u2018I\u2019m going to smash your face in.\u2019 But at the ball, he couldn\u2019t move for people shaking his hand. And I do think it is worthwhile for people to have him as a role model.\u201d Solomon found ballet school difficult at first. Aged 10, he had been attending classes for a little over six months when his teacher called round to the house to tell him to apply for the\u00a0school. Before that, his dancing had been limited to teaching his school\u00a0friends Spice Girl routines in the\u00a0playground. Once he started classes as a beginner, Solomon says he always felt something was holding him back. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel racism per se, but I felt like an outsider because I was so new to ballet. I didn\u2019t know the history of ballet, of composers, of choreographers. It\u2019s weird to think that there were 11-year-olds established in the ballet world, but there were. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the first clue and they made me feel like I didn\u2019t want or care about it enough because I didn\u2019t know these things. I was coming top three in my class and not being cast in the front. Then I was the only one in the year who got into the Royal Ballet.\u201d The establishment awaits the three brothers now, with Kidane an army officer, Solomon starring in A Winter\u2019s Tale at the Royal Opera House, and Amartey back from his time as an artist-in-residence for Sheikha Lateefa bint Maktoum of Dubai, after numerous sell-out exhibitions, and his next project set to be an artistic collaboration with Solomon. \u201cDubai has a huge art market, loads of galleries, but no one there is actually making art,\u201d he says. \u201cThe residency gave me creative space to develop. Now I have the freedom to do exhibitions I really care about.\u201d     Morning of the Sacrifice by Amartey Golding. Photograph: Amartey Golding    Recent weeks have been a whirlwind for the family since they stood at Sandhurst\u2019s Old College Square, watching Kidane receive one of the British military\u2019s highest honours, ahead of all the Oxbridge graduates, and the full story of the family\u2019s impressive achievements began to trickle out. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been extraordinary,\u201d Amartey laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that. And this is just the beginning. In this small family, we all keep each other balanced, keep everything in perspective.\u201d For Maryam, the successes of her children are important not just for the family, but for the path she feels they are forging for others. \u201cMy husband always said he didn\u2019t want the kids to just do well, he wanted them to break down barriers.

In Anwar Gets Everything \u2013 a nerve-shredding excerpt from The Bones of Grace \u2013 a Bengali labourer is ordered to wash the windows of a Dubai high-rise without proper safety precautions. Anyone who extrapolated from this a protest novel about the blood behind Emirati bling might be surprised. Anwar\u2019s story turns out to be only one element buried deep within a wider-roaming saga of star-crossed Ivy League academics. Most of the novel is narrated by Zubaida, a marine palaeontologist from Dhaka, whose fieldwork (in Pakistan, where she\u2019s hunting an ancient whale skeleton) gets caught in the crossfire of sectarian violence. During her graduate study at Harvard, she falls for blue-eyed Elijah, a\u00a0philosopher who hopes that she\u2019ll break off her engagement back home. But \u201chome\u201d is moot anyway: Zubaida is haunted by the knowledge that, as a baby, she was adopted, and that her biological parents left no trace of\u00a0themselves. Zubaida addresses an imaginary Elijah, recounting how they met and her turmoil on returning to Bangladesh. How the novel\u2019s disparate strands come together is a perpetual tease. On page 125 there\u2019s a tip-off: Anwar is \u201ccarrying his secret, which is also my secret\u201d. But 50 pages later, we\u2019re hardly wiser: \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for parsing out the story slowly, Elijah. These things take time.\u201d   Related: Tahmima Anam: \u2018I have a complicated relationship with Bangladesh\u2019    While the characters need no convincing of their feelings for each other, we do, and the book\u2019s structure makes this tricky: Zubaida has to write for us as well as for Elijah. Their coded correspondence once she returns to Bangladesh, in text messages consisting only of song titles \u2013 off-the-peg emotion \u2013 feels like Anam\u2019s workaround as much as theirs. Zubaida\u2019s heritage, or the lack of it, does a lot of heavy lifting: \u201cI was a person whose life began with her own life, and not, like you, with a family tree that stretched back generations \u2026 What would you do with this messy history, Elijah? Your chamomile-scented home, your overfed cat, lemonade in the refrigerator, and that family tree, so august, no mystery blood, no revolutions\u2026\u201d Almost all the book unfolds in this tone, wounded and puffed-up. Zubaida implies that her fiance might understand her better by reading Tolstoy, which \u2013 like that whale hunt \u2013 suggests the lofty company Anam wants to keep. Yet there are hints that she\u2019s not wholly happy with how this (at times superlative) novel knits together. With the plot speeding up, someone says \u201cit\u2019s too much randomness\u201d, and even Zubaida calls her story \u201cnonsensical\u201d. It isn\u2019t, but when she says Anwar\u2019s world \u201cmade everything else shrink \u2013 my little quest to find my origins, even the wound of your absence\u201d, it all but pops the ballo\u200bo\u200bn she\u2019s spent 350 pages blowing up.

He also celebrated an Italian child who a day earlier had drawn a picture of children inviting a migrant to join their football game, while criticising European politicians for failing to create healthy policies that promote integration. Touching on extremism, Francis said such groups were not a symptom of one particular faith: \u201cIn all religions there is also a group of fundamentalists that believe they are the holders of the truth.\u201d The pope concluded the meeting by thanking the participants for \u201cgiving me some of your youth as a gift\u201d, marking the latest bid by the Vatican to reach out to young people online. In March the papal Instagram account was launched \u2013 under the Latin name \u201cfranciscus\u201d \u2013 garnering 2.5 million followers of images and videos of the pope. Opening up to Instagram followed a February meeting between Francis and the company\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Systrom, who described the moment as one of the most memorable experiences of his life. The Vatican\u2019s digital-first strategy was already evident at the start of 2016 when the pope welcomed the former chief executive of Google, Eric Schmidt, to the heart of the Catholic Church.  Despite the Vatican\u2019s enthusiasm for social media, the current pope has described himself as a tech dinosaur and warned Catholics against putting their smartphones before real relationships. But he has also promoted the internet as a \u201cgift from God\u201d and a force for good; an approach he will likely take to the church\u2019s World Youth Day in Poland this July.", "title": "Pope reveals fondness for beauty vlogs in meeting with YouTubers", "sentences": ["The YouTube personalities were invited to the Vatican from six continents and included Hayla Ghazal, whose comedy clips from Dubai are aimed at changing attitudes to women in the Middle East, and Dulce Candy, a Mexican-American who crossed the US border illegally as a young child."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-29T17:01:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/30/insider-guide-belgrade-endless-coffees-partying", "tags": ["Cities", "Serbia", "Serbia holidays", "Regeneration", "Europe holidays", "World news", "Travel", "Culture"], "article": "In five words Charming mess, polluted Balkan beauty. Sound of the city       This is a recording from my window and the sounds I often have to listen at night. You can hear a very bad performance of live folk music, general street sounds and a man making comments about parking space. Belgrade is famous for its wild nightlife and also as a place that never sleeps. One of the reasons for this is the selective implementation, or lack of regulation regarding noise levels from bars and clubs in residential areas. The man talking about parking is also typical Belgrade, finding parking space is the main time investment here if you\u2019re a driver. Best building     Belgrade is full of brutalist architecture. Photograph: stillinbelgrade.com    This is a tough question for me, as I\u2019m a big lover of architecture and this love comes from growing up in Belgrade. The city has remarkable examples of post-second world war architecture, modernist buildings and a lot of brutalist architecture. My personal favourite is the beauty that is \u201cSIV\u201d! The last official name of the building is \u201cPalace of Serbia\u201d, but everyone still calls it SIV which stands for Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia. I prefer this name as it is built in Yugoslav times and its concept and architecture fit the idea of Yugoslavia. I like this building not only for it\u2019s architecture and design, but also for what it represents. Construction began right after the second world war when Yugoslavia was growing into an independent and strong socialist paradise where projects like this building were made into reality. The country where I was born and the country I live in are strikingly different. And I never moved. Homegrown talent Talented and charismatic theatre director Milo\u0161 Loli\u0107 has been making waves for quite some time now, in his native Belgrade as well as all across Europe. His theatre directing is always visually attractive, deeply thought through, stripped down and provocative. If in Belgrade I recommend his vision of Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in Yugoslav Drama Theatre or his take on Schiller\u2019s Maria Stuart at the National Theatre.  Best cultural Instagram       A very talented photographer depicting real life in Belgrade. With a great eye for documentary photography, his pictures don\u2019t show sunsets on the river or beautiful Belgrade women, they reflect this city\u2019s charm in a more profound style. Biggest controversy The biggest controversy right now is the Belgrade Waterfront project: a \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) development between the Serbian government andAbu Dhabi-based developer Eagle Hills. It\u2019s set to wipe away a whole area to make way for luxury apartments, a 140,000 sq m shopping mall (the biggest in the Balkans) and office spaces, all to be built in Dubai style. The area they plan to transform is Savamala, a post-industrial neighbourhood around the train lines and station, which in the last six or seven years has become home to the hippest restaurants, bars, clubs, art spaces and skater shops in the city. The project requires the city\u2019s urban plan to be redrawn to suit investor demands, and I think there has been a lack of transparency in the process. Big billboards and all sorts of aggressive promotion can be seen all over Belgrade. It looks so unreal, I\u2019m just hoping it\u2019s a government PR stunt. Most under-rated location     The city\u2019s green spaces are taken for granted. Photograph: Ivan Ikic    Belgrade is one of those cities that you can never stop exploring; there are lots of secret corners and areas not very well-known to general public or not too obvious for visitors. Most tourists come here for nightlife and affordable hedonism, but there\u2019s much more to see. Belgrade has a number of parks and small forests and it seems to me it\u2019s a part of the city everyone takes for granted and somehow doesn\u2019t value and explore enough.  I\u2019d recommend a visit to the Botanical Garden Jevremovac, a little green heaven in the city centre, in the midst of two of the noisiest streets. But when you\u2019re there, you feel completely isolated from the urban environment.  Best local artist It\u2019s tough to decide as Belgrade is home to many talented young artists, but here are a few: Bratislav Milenkovic is a hard working and witty illustrator, Milan Nenezi\u0107 is art\u2019s dark prince whose weapon is oil on canvas, and Marija Strajni\u0107 was originally an architect but is mostly known for her stunning photographic portfolio. Worst building     The Staklenac \u2026 \u2018an ugly glass monster\u2019. Photograph: Viktor Shekularatz    Since the beginning of 90s until now, there have been many ugly buildings and structures popping up. And it seems to never stop. The one building that represents the absolute downfall of Belgrade architecture and urban planning is the so-called Staklenac, an ugly glass monster of a 90s retro shopping mall, now mainly empty. It was built in 1989, exactly at the time when everyone started feeling political tension in ex-Yugoslavia and absurdly it was supposed to be a temporary object. It\u2019s located in the very heart of Belgrade, on the main square right next to the National Theatre and National Museum. For years now, everyone has been saying that it should be demolished but it\u2019s still there, standing strong. And ugly. The look on the street     Street style ... Photograph: Nemanja Knezevic    How green is your city? Belgrade is quite green, there are a lot of trees and parks and green surfaces. But, there\u2019s not too much environmental awareness: the city is very polluted and rivers are quite dirty and full of waste. It reflects the chaotic, corrupt system that we\u2019ve been living in for 25 years now. The \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives vary between municipalities. Some local councils are giving away recyclable garbage bags or try to inspire people to clean their dog shit (not a very popular move here). It looks green, but it\u2019s not very clean. Moment in history       Yugoslav president Tito\u2019s funeral on 8 May 1980. It was not a very celebratory moment, yet it was the biggest event that ever happened in Belgrade, with 700,000 people on the streets and 128 world leaders saying their final goodbyes.  This funeral symbolically represents the end of an era in world history. Tito was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement which promoted peaceful co-existence and partnership between countries who were not on the side of US nor the USSR during the cold war, and it definitely marked an end of an era in the history of Balkans. A political, economical and social experiment that was Yugoslavia was over. What does your city do better than anywhere else?     Stay young forever in Belgrade. Photograph: Ivan Ikic    There\u2019s no place in the world where time is so relative \u2013 and irrelevant. Everyone is always late. People are having endless coffees, partying until infinity.

What does this mean? Carla, by email  Indeed, curtains are where it\u2019s at now, and, sadly, this does not mean cutting down your curtains and turning them into a dress, as Scarlett O\u2019Hara memorably does when she goes to visit Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind (still my favourite fashion reference \u2013 bog off, Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s and your boring black dresses, give me crazy-eyed Scarlett wearing a pair of old velvet curtains any day.) It means oversized florals, the sort normally found on curtains in the homes of fabulous elderly relatives, worn all over your person. Your style icon for this is Adele in her latest video, Send My Love (To Your New Lover) which, frankly, sounds like a parody of an Adele song title, but no matter, let\u2019s focus on the frock. Adele\u2019s dress is gorgeous, as you\u2019d hope it would be, given that it\u2019s from Dolce &amp; Gabbana and therefore cost about \u00a35,000 \u2013 but then, as anyone who\u2019s ever visited Knightsbridge, Dubai or Moscow knows, high prices on designer clothes are no guarantee of style. It also bears a striking resemblance to the much-mocked floral Givenchy dress Kim Kardashian wore to the Met Ball in 2013 when she was heavily pregnant, and this similarity furnishes us with three possible lessons, depending on your feelings for the Kardashian family. First, if you are Team Kardashian, you can say that this proves Kim was just ahead of her time. If you are anti-Kardashian, say Kim\u2019s dress was hideous and Adele has shown us how to wear florals properly. And if you are meh about the whole thing, you can say they both look like Mrs Doubtfire and let\u2019s have no more of this nonsense. I\u2019m with number three here because, as the late and much missed Robin Williams memorably said, he wore florals in Mrs Doubtfire better than Kardashian at the Met Ball, and he definitely did, because he was Robin Williams and she\u2019s Kim Kardashian. Can Kim make unhappy schoolboys stand on their desks? Can she play a genie? I\u2019d like to see her try. But the point is, these florals are frumpy and unless you\u2019re as beautiful as Adele, most of us will look like Robin Williams in a dress. Not a bad look, but possibly not one you\u2019d pay for. There\u2019s a lot of guff in fashion magazines about how frumpy trends like this are actually feminist because they\u2019re not about looking sexy. But this is gold-plated nonsense. The truth is, these frumpy trends \u2013 florals, mid-length skirts, heavy tweeds, etc \u2013 are, if anything, even more elitist than the usual fashion looks because only the exceptionally thin and pretty can wear them without resembling a male comedian in bad drag, and yes, obviously, I am speaking from experience here. It\u2019s a shame, because these are precisely the kinds of clothes I like: the ones that aren\u2019t screamingly obvious in their need for approval, the ones that are made to appeal more to women than men. But while curtains may be the look of the season, I\u2019d prefer to watch Robin Williams than actually resemble him. ** Why is the fashion industry so besotted by Kim Kardashian? Catherine, north London  Yes, it\u2019s a Kardashian special this week. Wait, what do I mean \u201cthis week\u201d? Every week is Kardashian Week because this is their world and we\u2019re just living in it. You are quite right, Catherine: the fashion world is so entranced by Kim K these days that it is all but slurping spaghetti with her, Lady and the Tramp-style, and the only reason it isn\u2019t is because none of the people in this relationship do carbohydrates. In the past few weeks Kim gave a talk at Vogue Festival in London, where she thrillingly revealed that \u201ccontouring is over\u201d; she attended the Vogue 100 Gala; she went to the Met Ball in New York, invited by US Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour. Just as a reminder here that Kim is famous for three reasons: one, her father was friends with OJ Simpson; two, she was the victim of a sex-tape leak in 2006; three, her family has a reality TV show. None of these are the usual paths towards the fashion world\u2019s snooty heart, and I find it honestly admirable how the Kardashians, through sheer wild-eyed determination, have made them so. The short answer to Kim\u2019s popularity among fashion folk is social media. Social media is a profoundly immature world, filled with adults worrying about their popularity as if they were nerds in high school. Kim\u2019s one proven skill is mastering social media, and the fashion world has flocked towards her, desperate for the likes. We can despair of this but, really, I prefer to raise a vodka shot to Kim, our modern day Becky Sharp hacking her way through various social worlds, as chronicled now by Vanity Fair, the magazine as opposed to Vanity Fair the novel.

It was not quite the Crazy Gang of 1988 but it felt at once like a throwback and a thrilling step forwards. Now, more than ever, you sense that a club who had to rebuild from the very bottom 14 years ago have completed their rise and even if few of their supporters, not knowing whether to laugh or sob behind Wembley\u2019s western end, were minded to spare MK Dons a thought, it defies belief that the pair will be meeting on equal terms next season. Perhaps, every now and again, history decides to right itself.   Related: Sport picture of the day: Adebayo Akinfenwa in beast mode    If that is your way of thinking, then order was brought 12 minutes from time. Wimbledon had been the better side in a scrappy, skittish final, their directness and athleticism nullifying a Plymouth team who never found any rhythm. Callum Kennedy\u2019s half-cleared corner had been returned to him and, seeing Lyle Taylor dart towards the near post, he fizzed a low inswinger into the vacant space. Taylor, whose chances to add to his seasonal tally of 22 goals had been limited, was perfectly in sync and sent the deftest of flicks across Luke McCormick, celebrating by removing his shirt and sprinting up the touchline towards Ardley. The substitute Akinfenwa scored a generously awarded penalty, almost certainly his last kick as a Wimbledon player, as seven minutes of added time neared their conclusion \u2013 but the game already seemed well won by then. Wimbledon had grown stronger and stronger, as if spurred on by a sense of provenance, and it was not a feeling anyone was about to discourage. Ardley, who made 301 appearances for Wimbledon as a player before the Milton Keynes schism and became manager of the phoenix club in 2012, was clearly emotional in his press conference, arriving with his shirt out and soaked in champagne. There was little need for the apology he offered. \u201cIt\u2019s what you dream of,\u201d Ardley said. \u201cTo stand there in front of 20,000 people who 14 years ago had their club ripped away from them, and stand there as one of their own who came through the ranks at the age of 11, it doesn\u2019t get any better than that. You can write any story you want.\u201d Plymouth\u2019s support, more than 30,000 of whom arrived in laudable voice, might have expected a different narrative against a side they finished six points ahead of in the league, but were outbattled and found it hard to cope with the 6ft 4in striker Tom Elliott during the opening period. His knock-downs created a half-chance for Taylor and forced right-back Kelvin Mellor into a desperate intervention in front of goal. Clear chances, though, were few in the first half and it was a trend that continued into the second despite Wimbledon\u2019s gradual turning of the screw. \u201cI thought the gameplan worked exceptionally well,\u201d Ardley said. \u201cI knew it would be tense in the first half. They wanted a free-flowing game but we wanted to keep things in check as we have unbelievable legs. As the game went on I thought only one team was going to win it.\u201d That is probably true although extra time seemed more likely before Taylor\u2019s dab of the boot. A year ago Taylor was informed he was seventh-choice striker at Scunthorpe; it makes for a picture-book cup final story but the final word went to the unorthodox Akinfenwa, whose status as the nearest thing to a \u201cbox-office\u201d player here was underlined by the number of autographs he signed by the tunnel at half-time.   Related: AFC Wimbledon v Plymouth Argyle: League Two play-off final \u2013 live!    Akinfenwa had entered the pitch a minute before Taylor\u2019s goal, assisting in the move that led to the corner and missing a decent chance before Adebayo Azeez was impeded in the dying seconds. He put the penalty away and, after full-time, asked prospective managers to \u201chit me up on Whatsapp\u201d. His contract is up and Ardley has agreed that, at 34, he needs to be starting games; this was the \u201cBeast\u201d bowing out as only he could. Ardley could not hang around for too long to take it all in; he had a taxi to catch, taking him to the airport for a family holiday in Dubai. His players are off to Las Vegas for a trip that will probably involve rather less relaxation. \u201cThey\u2019ve already said they\u2019ll be sending me some pictures,\u201d he said, but the image rooted in his mind during the seven-hour flight will be the disbelieving mass of blue and yellow upon which he looked as he lifted the winners\u2019 trophy.

Ramsay is considering potential sites in Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham. He is also set to open three new restaurants in the US over the next 12 months, including a chippy in Las Vegas called Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Fish &amp; Chips. The US restaurants will extend Ramsay\u2019s partnership with Caesars Palace, the casino operator with which he already operates four outlets in the US. Stuart Gillies, the chief executive of the Gordon Ramsay Group (GRG), said he wanted to open a first restaurant in a major regional city within 18 months. \u201cWe are looking at properties in Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. There\u2019s a great dining scene there and we are just considering what the options are,\u201d he said. Gillies declined to say which of Ramsay\u2019s formats might migrate north, but the company has been expanding Maze Grill, its upmarket chain, and Kitchen, which offers casual dining. The only UK restaurant Ramsay has opened outside London was Amaryllis, in Glasgow, in 2001 but it closed in 2004. The new sites would be GRG\u2019s first openings in the UK for more than a year. GRG operates 14 restaurants in London and holds the license for 15 more around the world.  Sales for Kavalake, GRG\u2019s holding company, rose 12.6% to \u00a350.3m in the year to 31 August 2015 after it opened new sites in Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, France and the US, and two new Maze Grill restaurants and Heddon Street Kitchen in London. Despite the increase, Kavalake recorded its third year of operating losses, although they narrowed from \u00a31.5m in the previous year to \u00a31m.  Kavalake remained in red after a \u00a34m bill for legal costs relating to a fallout with Rowan Seibel, Ramsay\u2019s business partner in the Fat Cow, a Los Angeles restaurant which closed in 2014. Kavalake\u2019s debts stood at a chunky \u00a321.5m, including a \u00a314.2m loan from Ramsay himself, although that is down from \u00a324.3m a year before. The company said the legal costs did not include Ramsay\u2019s dispute with his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, who managed Ramsay\u2019s companies until the chef sacked him and his son Adam on the grounds of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d in 2010.  Last January the chef lost a case in which he accused Hutcheson of using a ghostwriter machine \u2013 commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically \u2013 to forge his signature on a document that made him the personal guarantor for the \u00a3640,000 annual rent of a London pub. Gillies said he expected the group to return to profit in the current year, with the various legal disputes finally coming to an end. \u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable we will be back in the black,\u201d he said. \u201cOur forecasts look to be on target and there is nothing in the woodwork on litigation and that is great news after years under that cloud.\u201d Gillies said the group was likely to open more restaurants in London, but he did not put a time scale on expansion. \u201cWe are glad to be in London in this period. There is more competition, but the more operators that come in they raise the level of quality. Certain restaurants will go but that\u2019s the nature of business because the quality should remain. London is the capital of the world for quality and creativity.\u201d He said that if Britain were to vote to leave the EU it would make life tougher for restaurateurs because many staff come from outside the UK. Big groups such as GRG have the resources to cope with any change, he said, but Brexit could mean that small family restaurants struggle to compete for staff, adding to the pressure already caused by the introduction of the government\u2019s new minimum wage for over-25s, the so-called national living wage.", "title": "Gordon Ramsay eyes first UK restaurants outside London", "sentences": ["Sales for Kavalake, GRG\u2019s holding company, rose 12.6% to \u00a350.3m in the year to 31 August 2015 after it opened new sites in Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, France and the US, and two new Maze Grill restaurants and Heddon Street Kitchen in London."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-30T16:44:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/may/30/weatherwatch-dubai-rain-artificial-mountain-scientists", "tags": ["Deserts", "Meteorology", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "article": "The Burj Khalifa dominates the skyline of Dubai; at more than 800 metres, it is the world\u2019s tallest building.

This idea is being explored in the UAE with assistance from the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The basic idea is sound. Mountains force the incoming winds upwards; air cools as it rises, causing moisture to condense and turn to rain or snow. The researchers are carrying out detailed modelling and will report this year on how high a mountain and how steep a slope is needed. The UAE is one of the driest nations in the world, with annual rainfall less than 100mm a year. A program of cloud seeding from the air is already under way, and was credited with increasing rainfall earlier this year. This remains controversial. NCAR says that even after several decades of research, there is a \u201clack of hard, consistent and repeatable evidence\u201d that cloud seeding actually works. Hence the need for a more radical approach. Cost has put a halt to previous mountain-building.

Harris, the president and co-founder of PA Classics, the club based in Manheim, at which Pulisic\u2019s young career really kicked on, had seen enough of him to know how he would react to senior international football. The answer, in short: he would hardly change a thing. \u201cThe first time I saw him play, I thought he was a little on the small side,\u201d Harris says of Pulisic, who joined the Classics a couple of years after his return from England. \u201cThen I realised he was playing two years above his age group. The kids were always a foot taller, a bit more physical than he was, but he really learned to refine his ability that way and it was remarkable to watch. His special awareness \u2013 where to go, where the ball was going to fall \u2013 was just something else, and you could tell right away that he was absolutely fearless. \u201cI remember watching an academy game and it went into penalties. Straightaway, Christian, the youngest kid by a long way, stepped right up. Big moment, big game, but he had the sheer confidence and mindset that he would score \u2013 which he did. Seeing that, I knew there was something unique about his psychological construct.\u201d Pulisic certainly had suitable teachers. His mother Kelley played football to a high level at university, while Mark Pulisic needs little introduction to those who followed indoor soccer in the 1990s, having scored prolifically during eight years as a professional with Harrisburg Heat.     A nine-year-old Christian Pulisic playing for the PA Classics. Photograph: PA Classics    By the age of five, their son\u2019s speed and athleticism were apparent to his parents but, as with any youngster in the US, there were plenty of sports to try \u2013 there was no special desire to nudge him towards following in the family\u2019s footsteps. An interest honed in Oxfordshire was cemented after a spell playing in Detroit, where the family lived while Mark coached the short-lived Detroit Ignition side; when they came back to Pennsylvania a move to the Classics, one of the first US Soccer Development Academies and thus a major player both locally and nationally, seemed a natural choice. Mark Pulisic knew Harris \u2013 the pair had coached college sides against one another \u2013 and was good friends with the club\u2019s influential director of coaching Steve Klein, soon joining the set-up himself. From there, father and son began a journey whose sense of inevitability grew. \u201cBy then his desire to really concentrate on football \u2013 at 10, 11, 12 \u2013 was what made the difference,\u201d Mark says. \u201cHe never shied away from anything or made excuses. He was never afraid of taking on new challenges, and you see a lot of players in America who find it very difficult to do that, because the US is a very comfortable place. He wanted to be out of his comfort zone at a young age and that\u2019s when I knew there could be something special.\u201d Mark Pulisic would take Christian to visit European clubs during the summers; he visited at least one of Spain\u2019s giants and spent time with a leading Premier League club\u2019s academy, too. This was more to gain a taste of the environment than to send him overseas too young; his progress had already turned enough heads domestically, and he was appearing for national youth teams by the age of 13, going on to shine in the Residency Programme and playing in competitions such as the one that, eventually, turned Dortmund\u2019s head. \u201cWhen he was 15 and playing in the national sides, he realised he had to make the move quickly for the development of his game,\u201d Mark says. \u201cOnce, as parents, we felt he was ready and it was something he wanted, we went to visit Dortmund. All of us decided we felt it was the right move and the club was great with us, so we took the plunge. You have to go with your gut feeling.\u201d It has been almost three years since Christian, whose move was eased by the fact that his grandfather was born in Croatia and he could apply for citizenship, arrived in Germany, although he officially signed at the start of 2015. The whirlwind has gathered pace. Mark travelled with him and currently coaches Dortmund\u2019s Under-10s; the move has been valuable for his career, too, but most important is his proximity to Christian, 3,800 miles from home, in the apartment they share. It is vital, Mark says, to make sure Christian takes time away from the sport \u2013 the pair play golf together \u2013 or invites friends from the Dortmund Under-19 side round to socialise; it is important, too, to afford him his own space as he gets older and Mark feels that Christian\u2019s time with the Copa America squad will be of benefit, hearing and living among different voices and saving relatively perfunctory WhatsApp messages for father-son chat. Christian has friends in more exalted places now, too. A winter in Dubai, joining Dortmund\u2019s first-team training camp, led to a place in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s senior squad, and nothing has held him back since. The records have tumbled: he was the youngest foreigner to score in the Bundesliga when opening his account against Hamburg on 17 April; when he scored at Stuttgart six days later, he became the youngest player of any nationality to have scored twice in the division. \u201cI would never have expected what he\u2019s done and accomplished so far,\u201d Mark says. \u201cTo be quite honest, as a parent I wish it hasn\u2019t gone as fast, because we worry about him missing a lot of his teenage childhood, but I can\u2019t have a say in that now. We\u2019re just trying to guide him and help him deal with all that\u2019s happening.\u201d That concern is helped by the fact that Klinsmann, to whom Christian\u2019s grounding in German methods holds particular appeal, has spoken to him about the handling of his son\u2019s development. Mark trusts Klinsmann, but if the current rate of progress continues, there must be the temptation to pitch Christian in from the start at the Copa, even if not in Friday\u2019s opener against Colombia. \u201cAll 23 are ready to play from the beginning on,\u201d Klinsmann said after last week\u2019s win over Ecuador, hardly killing the idea stone dead, and the possibility of Christian playing a starring role against Paraguay in Philadelphia \u2013 a game that constitutes something of a homecoming \u2013 would certainly be a logical step in the fairytale. It would also be the latest piece of evidence that the pathway for American youngsters to become big news across the pond has been set. Christian\u2019s is not the first success story to emerge from PA Classics \u2013 the 20-year-old midfielder Russell Canouse made his debut for another Bundesliga side, Hoffenheim, in March \u2013 but it has captured more imaginations than any other and might just prove to be a landmark. \u201cEvery family connected with our club talks about his achievements,\u201d says Harris. \u201cThey tell me how their kids are talking about him, and how it\u2019s renewed a spark in their attitudes towards the game. They\u2019re all up watching, or taping, Bundesliga games and seeing how he is doing. It\u2019s created so much excitement and energy, and it\u2019s been an absolute thrill to ride along with that.\u201d Perhaps they are saying the same in Tackley and Brackley, too; regardless, it is a story that will sweep plenty more people off their feet in the years to come.", "title": "Christian Pulisic: the making of a young man ready to step up", "sentences": ["A winter in Dubai, joining Dortmund\u2019s first-team training camp, led to a place in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s senior squad, and nothing has held him back since."], "publicationDate": "2016-05-31T14:37:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/natwest-partner-zone/2016/jun/02/export-partner-small-business-global", "tags": ["NatWest partner zone"], "article": "There are promising ways to begin your exporting adventures, and then there are other ways which you might want to avoid. \u201cI was flown out to Dubai by someone who wanted to do a deal, handed a contract written using Sharia law, and they kept me in their office till 11.30 at night, trying to get me to sign it, with their own lawyer warning me I could be in very big trouble if I did something wrong,\u201d recalls Jane Malyon, founder of The English Cream Tea Company.  Malyon can laugh now: at the time she felt under considerable pressure. On flying home, she showed the contract to a UK lawyer with experience of the Middle East. \u201cHe said, \u2018you didn\u2019t sign this, did you?\u2019\u201d Luckily, she hadn\u2019t and because an alternative contract she got drawn up wasn\u2019t subsequently acceptable, the deal was off.  Do the research It was an early lesson learned. Malyon, who is currently poised to sign several overseas deals, now takes plenty of time to do her own research on potential partners. With a Canadian agent she is now working with, she says \u201cit was after, I think, the fifth conversation\u201d that she made a firm decision to go ahead and take him on.     Matt Deighton, managing director of Sofas by Saxon, says you need to develop mutual respect with your agent.    Developing trust with local partners is critical to getting your product into an unfamiliar market, says Matt Deighton, managing director of Bolton-based manufacturers Sofas by Saxon. Export makes up 15% of the company\u2019s business, and has been a vital part of the mix since it launched in 1982. Even though the internet has made selling direct to customers perfectly feasible in some overseas markets, it\u2019s from straightforward in others, such as China and Russia.  You need to be discriminating when choosing an agent or distributor, and you need persistence, Deighton says. Look at who else they have on their books: \u201cIf they\u2019re representing recognised names, or complementary products \u2013 in our sector that might be lighting or flooring \u2013 that puts them in the right sphere of the type of customers they\u2019re talking to. \u201cWe then contact those companies directly, and ask \u2018does this agent really represent you, and are they any good? Often, if they\u2019re not direct competitors to you, people are very obliging with information.\u201d Use an existing network There is also a plethora of no-cost and low-cost advice and information available via UKTI, says Ed Salt, managing director at Cheshire-based Delamere Dairy, which exports goat\u2019s and cow\u2019s milk products to China via an agent in Hong Kong. It\u2019s also worth approaching UK embassies and chambers of commerce in foreign capitals. These have access to sector and country trade specialists, and can provide dedicated research via the Overseas Market Introduction Service.      Ed Salt, managing director of Delamere Dairy, took a chance on the Chinese market.    When the 2008 recession hit, Delamere Dairy decided to take a chance on a market of 1.4 billion Chinese people, many of whom are known to have an intolerance to cow\u2019s milk. They employed a British agent who was already set up in Hong Kong to build relationships with various distribution channels to sell their goat\u2019s milk, yoghurt, cheese and butter. At the time there was no registered Chinese standard for goat\u2019s milk and two pallets were rejected after it was tested against criteria based on cow\u2019s milk, but 18 months later Delamere has a trusted distributor with a wide penetration in the Chinese market.  Accountant Tahzeen Basunia, who co-founded the upmarket confectionary brand Jealous, says that he always saw 90% of the company\u2019s market being overseas and finding opportunities has been a key part of the firm\u2019s strategy. \u201cWe do a lot of our own research on the internet to find out which markets are suitable to the brand... It takes up a lot of time,\u201d he explains.  But it wasn\u2019t until they got some traction at home that the brand was taken seriously abroad. Basunia admits that he and his business partner wore through a lot of shoe leather knocking on doors to get the sweets into upmarket hotels such as Claridges, plus Harvey Nichols and Selfridges in the UK. These partnerships were essential and led to agreements with the consolidators on which they now rely.  Jealous now works with big exporters who consolidate lots of different products, deal with translating brand names and ingredients, do all the necessary restickering, and clear the stock through customs. If an overseas buyer that the luxury sweet brand has approached is interested, Basunia simply delivers the stock to a consolidator in the UK and accepts that a slice will come off the profits.     You\u2019re entering into a long-term relationship and you don\u2019t get married on the first date  Chris Heyes     Build trust and insights Chris Heyes, head of international for the International Festival for Business that kicks off in Liverpool in June, says that finding an agent takes time, and travelling to meet the person can give great insight. \u201cSo go out [to the country you\u2019re interested in] and don\u2019t expect to get a deal signed on that first meeting. You\u2019re entering into a long-term relationship, and you don\u2019t get married on the first date. It\u2019s about building trust.\u201d You may, of course, need to take advice from in-country experts and evolve your product to tap into overseas markets, says Malyon: her scones have a shelf life of just two days, so exporting her cream tea hampers simply isn\u2019t a goer. But after realising that Japanese and US markets are crying out for heritage brands, she now puts together boxes packed with stylish teapots, linen tea towels and luxury conserves, and is trialling a shippable bake-your-own-scone mixture. She\u2019s also thinking of ways to franchise \u201ca really beautiful British tea-room experience\u201d as a longer term goal in overseas markets. Mitigating the risks that many entrepreneurs worry about when entering a new market abroad also requires constant communication with whoever you choose, concludes Matt Deighton at Sofas by Saxon. \u201cYou want somebody who gets back to you: if they\u2019re not that keen, you can tell\u2026 I like an agent to be quizzing us as well, digging deep \u2013 it shows that they actually care,\u201d he says.  \u201cOpenness and transparency goes a long way \u2013 you are crossing boundaries and borders and the more you put into that relationship, the more confidence you\u2019ll build. Because the last thing the agent wants is to put time and effort into your product and for you to fail on a delivery\u2026 that affects their relationships and their credibility.\u201d  The relationship must be based on mutual respect. \u201cThe more an agent can understand what you do as a company, and why whatever you\u2019re selling is different and better, the more they\u2019ll be able to do for you.\u201d This advertisement feature is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with NatWest, sponsor of the winning new business and business essentials hubs.", "title": "Going global: the trials and tribulations of finding an export partner", "sentences": ["\u201cI was flown out to Dubai by someone who wanted to do a deal, handed a contract written using Sharia law, and they kept me in their office till 11.30 at night, trying to get me to sign it, with their own lawyer warning me I could be in very big trouble if I did something wrong,\u201d recalls Jane Malyon, founder of The English Cream Tea Company."], "publicationDate": "2016-06-02T08:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/02/martin-fry-abc-comeback-lexicon-of-live-ii-godfather-part-ii", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Martin Fry has done his time on the comeback circuit \u2013 and in unexpected ways, too. Ten years ago, he trekked through the rainforest to the top of Mount Roraima, the flat-topped mountain in South America that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s The Lost World. He went not with Bear Grylls, or Ed Stafford, but with Spandau Ballet\u2019s Tony Hadley and Richard Drummie from Go West, in aid of charity. Fifty or so fans came along to share the trip; 3,000 metres high, barriers were broken down. Still, Fry drew the line at sharing a tent with Hadley; they are both 6ft 3in. One night, camping in a car park in Venezuela, he awoke to hear his old 80s pop rival performing Gold on someone\u2019s karaoke machine. That might have been a sufficiently close brush with the foreign-travel-and-reunited-bands circuit: Fry is not sure he could manage a full-on 80s nostalgia cruise with other groups. But, given that time has a strange way of making old music sound new again, he probably won\u2019t have to.     Fry in his pomp \u2013 and a gold lam\u00e9 suit. Photograph: ABC/Getty Images    We meet just before the release of The Lexicon of Love II, the most anticipated record Fry has made in years. It\u2019s the sequel to the album that broke his band ABC 34 years ago and featured songs that came to epitomise the music known as New Pop \u2013 The Look of Love, Poison Arrow and All of My Heart. Fry, the only permanent member of ABC, is still blond, with a tanned and lived-in look to the face that first entered the public consciousness under a straw boater and an 80s cowlick. He admits that veteran ABC fans have queried the album\u2019s ballsy title \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people on Twitter saying, who the hell do you think you are?\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s obviously a companion piece to the first record, he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of Godfather Part II. What has happened to these characters? Are they older, wiser, stupider, happier? I genuinely wanted to make a sequel with me as I am now, as a 57-year-old man.\u201d The new album is an eerie experience, grabbing you by the throat for 11 tracks cracked straight from a time capsule of New Pop songwriting \u2013 luxuriant chord-changes, big emotive statements (\u201cI fly like a condor to the heart of the new day sun\u201d) and the plushest strings you\u2019ve heard since ELO \u2013 or early ABC, for that matter \u2013 courtesy of Anne Dudley of the Art of Noise, who scored the original Lexicon of Love. Fry\u2019s voice is pretty much unchanged: he has found a few tricks to avoid the high notes \u2013 there are no yippee-yi-yippee-yi-yays \u2013 but there is one of his famous spoken word breaks on Kiss Me Goodbye. He wrote the record with, among others, Rob Fusari, who discovered Lady Gaga (\u201cand has consequently spent a lot of time in court\u201d). He had 40 new songs in total, and persuaded Virgin Records to listen to a couple of them on his phone while attending a meeting about one of his \u201cnumerous compilation albums\u201d. Shortly after, he was invited back and found himself \u201cfurther up the building\u201d. He couldn\u2019t wait for Trevor Horn, who worked on The Lexicon of Love, to be available, so he produced the record himself, with Go West producer Gary Stevenson. Time was of the essence, after all. \u201cI\u2019m a man out of time till the stars realign,\u201d as he says on Brighter Than the Sun.         The Look of Love, from The Lexicon of Love, is the band\u2019s best-performing single.    Fry says the \u201ccontrary, stubborn bastard side\u201d of his nature served him well in the early days of ABC, in Sheffield, when disco, funk, soul, Rodgers and Hammerstein and Sinatra came together in a perfect storm. When he watches himself on early Top of the Pops clips, Fry wonders if he was truly as imperious as he looked. \u201cI used to obsess about ABC,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was a Falklands war on. I was obsessed with the minutiae, the back of the record sleeve, the fact that the 12in needed redesigning. Is that healthy?\u201d After ABC\u2019s initial success, however, he veered away from the music that had brought him three Top 10 singles, turning to dour college rock for the band\u2019s second album, Beauty Stab, described by Simon Reynolds as \u201cone of the greatest career-sabotage LPs in pop history\u201d. The third ABC album, How to Be a \u2026 Zillionaire, was a slightly confusing satire about money, in which the band were trying to style themselves as cartoon characters, Fry explains. He thinks it was ahead of its time; his record company didn\u2019t care. \u201cI walked into the Phonogram office and our poster was on the wall, and they had drawn moustaches on it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the label! The record wasn\u2019t even out yet!\u201d ABC\u2019s chart presence continued to diminish, and in the late 80s Fry was out of action for a time, fighting Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare form of cancer. In 1992, his long-time musical accomplice Mark White left the band to pursue a career in alternative therapies (he is now a reiki master in London) and Fry was dropped by EMI as a solo artist and \u201ccame out the exit door\u201d of his career.     Performing with 80s pop rival Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet. Photograph: Hayley Madden/Redferns    \u201cI went from having a Ha\u00e7ienda and Shoom card in my wallet to an Ikea one,\u201d he says. He chews over the words \u201cflatpack furniture assemblage\u201d. He was still in his early 30s and his future was already behind him. \u201cIt was terrifying. I toyed with the idea of opening a boutique hotel-cum-sanitarium for anyone from the 1980s who had had a hit in the Top 40. My thinking was, you would be able to sit in the bar going: \u2018Remember when my record was in the charts?\u2019 I could have made a fortune. I salute anyone who has been through that process, from the Libertines to any of the bands on Eurovision. It takes a real survival instinct to get back on the stage.\u201d It didn\u2019t take him long to do it himself. Fry had taken ABC\u2019s hits from Dubai to Ghana to the Albert Hall with a 72-piece orchestra long before the 80s was offficially a thing again. In 1999, he got himself on an arena package tour with Culture Club and the Human League and was thrilled to see the venues selling out. He loved the experience, loved the ready-made audience and the way you could \u201crecreate the moment of the record\u2019s inception with smoke and mirrors\u201d. \u201cBut I started wondering, at what point do you start to become your own tribute act, do you start to caricature yourself?\u201d         Poison Arrow was a Top 10 hit in 1982.    The old days were like boxing, he says: \u201cSpandau Ballet were the Islington heavyweights. New Order, Dexys, Duran Duran \u2013 there were loads of us all seethingly jealous of each other, if they would admit to it.\u201d Being on the revival circuit got him used to not being at the top of the Christmas tree. The advent of acid house helped, too, he says, \u201cbecause suddenly you were out in a field\u201d. (ABC had flirted with house music on their fifth album, Up.) While the competition is still fierce among the golden oldies on the victory lap, as he likes to call them, the pressures of performing in the modern industry setting are much greater than they were. He compares New Pop and the New Romantics to Kabuki theatre: \u201cYou had the makeup, the masks and everyone was miming. Now, everyone needs to be able to play live \u2013 on Jools Holland or at Glastonbury. Only the repertoire you\u2019ve built up provides a wall of protection.\u201d The Lexicon of Love II is a concept album about love in middle age, an unusual subject in itself. Many of Fry\u2019s friends in the business have a succession of young girlfriends, he says; he credits his wife of 30 years, and his two children, with preserving his sanity. \u201cMen over 50 gradually become invisible,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one really listens to what they are saying. I\u2019ve done my midlife crisis. Some of the people who\u2019ve come to my shows, they\u2019ve been through some crazy shit. Divorces, health issues, the failed companies they set up. I figured that was more interesting \u2013 that stuff is the real rollercoaster of life.\u201d     ABC \u2013 with Fry, far right \u2013 make an appearance at HMV on Oxford Street, London. Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex Features    There will be no gold lam\u00e9 suit this time around. It doesn\u2019t feel right, he says; he prefers a more subtle Ozwald Boateng number. He says Mrs Fry has warned him about \u201cgoing down the hall of mirrors, the palace of Versailles\u201d, which is the couple\u2019s shorthand for the self-obsession and preening that comes with a life in pop. \u201cIt\u2019s an attention-seeking, narcissistic thing, being a lead singer,\u201d he says, \u201cno matter what age you are.\u201d     \u2018It\u2019s actually a pretty good time for albums after all. It\u2019s like the art form is coming back\u2019 \u2013 Martin Fry. Photograph: Roger Sargent    He has to go: he has an early cycling trip in the morning, although he has to be careful not to overdo the pedalling when he has a gig that night. Before he disappears, I ask him about a rumour that the album was originally going to be called The Lexicon of a Lost Ideal. \u201cThat was a statement asking, why the hell would you want to make an album in 2016?\u201d he explains. \u201cBut then I realised it\u2019s actually a pretty good time for albums after all. It\u2019s like the art form is coming back. People do care, don\u2019t they?\u201d He has a gentle way of probing you for your opinion. That leads him on to David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar, which he thinks of as a unique double album. \u201cThere is the one you got on Friday 8 January and had the weekend to enjoy. And there is the album you got on 13 January, when he had died, which was his tombstone.\u201d Bowie, of course, was a crucial figure to the New Pop generation. Fry had hitchhiked down to London to see him as a teenager, and the young Fry was coloured in shades of Bowie \u2013 the theatricality, the voice, the Englishness, even the sharp cut of the chin. \u201cI never thought my parents would outlive him,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve heard Nick Rhodes and Gary Kemp say it, too \u2013 that he was like a father, somehow.\u201d There will be festival shows over the summer, and then a full-on ABC tour in the autumn, including one show with an orchestra, the Southbank Sinfonia, at the Royal Festival Hall, conducted by Anne Dudley. It\u2019s a big band \u2013 nine of them onstage with a three-piece brass section. The other day, Fry was travelling up north on a train with his bandmates and the champagne came out at breakfast. The younger members of the band were amused by this flash of a former, more hedonistic, era in pop. And so, in a way, was Fry. \u201cNo one in their 50s should really be having this much fun,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you know what I mean?\u201d The Lexicon of Love II is out now on Virgin EMI.

What followed were several exhausting days and nights as Canadian officials and his lawyers pushed for Alaradi to be released and allowed to leave the country, said lawyer Paul Champ: \u201cWe were biting our nails right until the last second.\u201d  Mohamed Eldarat was released on Tuesday and Kamal on Thursday, Champ said. Both Americans remain in the country. Alaradi was released from jail late on Tuesday evening. Canadian officials accompanied him soon after to the airport, only to find out he was subject to a travel ban.  As Canadian officials worked frantically to have the ban lifted, it was feared he would be arrested again by state security officials as his visa had expired while he was in prison. \u201cWe were keeping him in a secret location until we could negotiate confirmation that he would be able leave the country,\u201d Champ said. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite emotionally exhausting for him.\u201d Alaradi is now en route to Istanbul, where he will receive immediate medical attention and be reunited with his family. Champ said he was suffering from multiple health issues, ranging from kidney stones to a pinched nerve in his back and ringing in one of his ears. \u201cHe\u2019s very gaunt \u2013 I\u2019m estimating he\u2019s lost 40 to 50 pounds.\u201d  Once doctors in Turkey confirm he is healthy enough to withstand the journey to Canada, Alaradi will return to his home in southern Ontario. \u201cThis is just the first step in his recovery, it\u2019s going to be a long road for him,\u201d said Champ.  On Thursday, his 18-year-old daughter Marwa, speaking to the Guardian from Doha and on her way to Istanbul, was breathless with excitement. \u201cI\u2019m on top of the world right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel amazing.\u201d She had spoken to her father several times this week, hearing his voice for the first time in more than a year. \u201cI\u2019m very happy this day came. I\u2019ve been fighting for it for almost two years,\u201d she said, her voice shaking with emotion.  The nearly two-year ordeal attracted widespread criticism from groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Drewery Dyke, a researcher for Amnesty International, told the Guardian in an earlier interview the trial had been \u201cstrewn with a catalogue of flaws and shocking human rights violations\u201d, including imprisonment for a year without charge or access to counsel. In February, a report by the UN working group on arbitrary detention called for the immediate release of the four men, documenting the men\u2019s claims that they were subjected to electric shocks, whipped, had guns held to their heads, had been placed in a freezer for up to 45 minutes and \u201chung with a rope around the neck\u201d.

At Epsom Downs on Derby day, during the two-and-a-half minutes it will take to run the big race, the answer is about \u00a3100,000. The winner will earn a record first prize of \u00a3876,170, and a (conservative) valuation as a future stallion of \u00a315m. The \u00a330,000-per-second of the Championship play-off final, the \u201crichest game in football\u201d, seems meagre by comparison. Yet the money will be the last thing on the minds of the 16 jockeys as they set off around this uniquely demanding track at 4.30pm on Saturday afternoon. They use a different measure. For them, a second is worth five lengths, a tenth of a second is half a length, and a hundredth of a second is the nose that could be the winning margin in what is still the world\u2019s most famous Flat race.   Related: Frankie Dettori gives Derby hope Wings Of Desire a spin around Epsom    In its blend of intensity, significance and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, there is no event in any sport to match the Derby, and this year the Epsom Classic promises to be more open and competitive than any since at least 1999, when Dubai Millennium was the 5-1 favourite and finished ninth in a 16-strong field. Sixteen are due to go to post again on Saturday, and there is no odds-on favourite poised for coronation. Any one of four colts could head the market on Saturday afternoon, and all but two are priced up with a plausible each-way chance. It is a year when the man holding the reins could not simply make a difference, but make all the difference. And it has a field of jockeys to match the horses. For the first time since 2010, the three most famous and successful riders of the last 20 years \u2013 Frankie Dettori, Kieren Fallon and Ryan Moore \u2013 will all ride in the race. Every champion jockey since 1994 who is still active will also be in the field, which adds Paul Hanagan, Silvestre de Sousa and Jamie Spencer to the outstanding riding talents plotting a path around this notoriously difficult track. Pat Smullen, the reigning Irish champion, is in the line-up too, as well as Micka\u00ebl Barzalona, the rider of Cloth Of Stars, who has a 100% record after his memorable success \u2013 and somewhat premature celebration \u2011 on Pour Moi in 2011. \u201cI genuinely wouldn\u2019t be surprised if any one of eight won it, maybe more,\u201d Moore, who rides US Army Ranger, said on Friday. \u201cWe are dealing with lightly raced, middle-distance colts, most of whom are unexposed and ready to take a big step forward. There are several who could stick their hand up on Saturday afternoon. Let\u2019s hope I am on the one who sticks it up the highest.\u201d From the first stride to the last, the 16 jockeys will be hyper-aware, processing all the sights and sounds around them in split-seconds while thinking their way through all the permutations for the remainder of the race. When the Derby\u2019s founders chose their terrain back in 1780, they chose well. Its 12 furlongs test a horse\u2019s speed, stamina, balance and resolution, and the ability to gallop at high speed both uphill and down. It puts jockeys under maximum pressure too. There will not be a moment to pause and take stock, as they try to play to their partner\u2019s strengths, minimise any flaws and find the most efficient route from starting stall to winning post, while 15 other quicksilver racing brains do the same. Succeed, and the rewards are immense. A single mistake or error of judgment, however, can leave a rider saddled with the most expensive bad luck story in the business. Tens of thousands of thoroughbred colts were foaled in 2013, and every horse in Saturday\u2019s race has already defied immense odds to reach the final field. Epsom does not offer second chances, and in the punters\u2019 eyes, it is as true now as always that horses win races, and jockeys lose them. One horse may yet emerge on Saturday to dispatch his field by several lengths, but the ways in which the various riders decide to play their hands as their chances wax and wane will still form a compelling sub-plot to the drama on the Downs. Moore and Dettori, who rides Wings Of Desire, another of the favourites, will snare most of the attention, but Fallon too will attract support, even at 33-1, as he is, by general consent, one of the finest riders around Epsom that the sport has seen. Fallon has won the Derby three times, first aboard Oath in that wide-open year back in 1999, and then twice for Sir Michael Stoute, who trains Across The Stars, his ride in the race this year. He has said in the past that his affinity with Epsom is something he cannot explain, but it is has been a feature of his long career and is unlikely to have diminished with age. At 51, more than twice the age of Barzalona, Fallon would be the oldest winning jockey since Scobie Breasley in 1966, yet at the same time, as with so much else about Fallon, it would not be a complete surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an open Derby,\u201d Paul Hanagan, the champion jockey in 2010 and 2011 and the rider of 16-1 chance Massaat, said on Friday. \u201cIt will be intense out there. Everyone will have their plans, and you have to be in the zone, but I hope that having had experience of riding in big races around here, I might cope with it better than some of the others. Experience counts. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to go around with people like Frankie and Ryan Moore, and growing up, I was one of Kieren\u2019s biggest fans and I still am. To be in the race with all of them, I\u2019m just really looking forward to being part of it.\u201d Sixteen horses, 16 riders, two-and-a-half minutes and countless possibilities. It remains to be seen whether the field for this year\u2019s Derby includes a true champion, but the outstanding jockeys of the past two decades are all in attendance, in with a chance and only too aware that every fraction of a second counts.", "title": "Greatest jockeys of the generation line up for wide-open Derby", "sentences": ["Related: Frankie Dettori gives Derby hope Wings Of Desire a spin around Epsom    In its blend of intensity, significance and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, there is no event in any sport to match the Derby, and this year the Epsom Classic promises to be more open and competitive than any since at least 1999, when Dubai Millennium was the 5-1 favourite and finished ninth in a 16-strong field."], "publicationDate": "2016-06-03T16:40:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/05/jos-buttler-england-test-royal-london-cup-lancashire", "tags": ["Jos Buttler", "England cricket team", "Jonny Bairstow", "Lancashire", "Warwickshire", "Royal London Cup", "Cricket", "IPL", "Sport"], "article": "If Jonny Bairstow is growing tired of being asked whether he wants to continue as England\u2019s Test wicketkeeper or revert to being a specialist batsman, then the man he replaced in the side \u2013 one who plans to mount a fresh assault on his place \u2013 can certainly empathise. Jos Buttler, now back in the country after 11 weeks of playing Twenty20 cricket around India, says he faced similar doubts over his desire to wear the gloves in the past having, like Bairstow, shot to prominence primarily through his exploits with a bat in hand. It is what prompted Buttler to leave Somerset for Lancashire at the end of the 2013 season, when Craig Kieswetter was preferred as the club\u2019s first choice wicketkeeper. As one of the country\u2019s most dynamic and explosive talents, Buttler could have stuck it out as a batsman but instead decided to up sticks in order to remain behind the stumps.   Related: What does Jos Buttler\u2019s IPL deal say about cricket\u2019s new world order? | Barney Ronay    And so he fully understands why Bairstow, who needs only two dismissals in the third Test with Sri Lanka at Lord\u2019s on Thursday to pass the English record of 17 in a three-match series held by Geraint Jones against the same opposition in 2006, might be a tad prickly on the subject, even if the alternative scenario that has been floated, one where the Yorkshireman\u2019s astonishing batting form is harnessed up the order, sees Buttler back in. \u201cJonny wants to be a wicketkeeper-batsman and it must be frustrating that people are questioning that,\u201d Buttler told the Observer. \u201cPeople need to leave him alone and get behind him \u2013 it\u2019s obvious how much he wants to keep wicket and he\u2019s done well. I remember those very same questions and it wasn\u2019t until I moved to Lancashire people started to believe me. \u201cAll that stuff about whether we can play in the same Test team, it\u2019s irrelevant for me. He\u2019s the man in possession. And if you have been dropped from the side you have to show you have improved and demand to be selected. That\u2019s what he did. He made himself to impossible to ignore.\u201d How Buttler achieves this is complicated by the schedule. Sunday\u2019s Royal London Cup fixture for Lancashire at home to Warwickshire continues an exclusive diet of white-ball cricket that began after the second Test against Pakistan in Dubai \u2013 the last in the whites of his country \u2013 and runs up until the end of England\u2019s limited-overs series with Sri Lanka. Given the 25-year-old\u2019s status as England\u2019s first-choice wicketkeeper for those five one-dayers and single Twenty20 where, ironically, Bairstow could feature as a batsman, the first County Championship fixture Buttler could play for Lancashire, against Durham on 16 July, comes two days after the first Test with Pakistan begins at Lord\u2019s, with just one more before the series ends and the one-dayers start again. Buttler does not regret his short-term career choices, however, having stayed on in India after the final of the World Twenty20 to play for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. It is a spell in which he claims to have learned \u201ca lot about cricket and myself as a person\u201d, having played 14 matches in the tournament and finished their third highest scorer. As well as being blown away by the IPL experience, and having learned about coping with expectation that comes with having a \u00a3385,000 price tag and being one of four overseas players permitted in the playing XI, Buttler embraced the country as a whole, with a visit to the slums of Mumbai a personal highlight in an otherwise travel-heavy itinerary. He said: \u201cIndia is such an attack on your senses and is unrivalled for the passion surrounding cricket. But one of the best things away from playing was a visit to a Mumbai slum. You see people in their conditions, getting stuck into their way of life and not moaning, and realise how lucky you are to be doing what you are doing. It put things into perspective.\u201d While his time with Mumbai lacked one stellar knock, like the unbeaten 66 against Sri Lanka that sealed England\u2019s semi-final place in the World Twenty20 or his three record-breaking one-day knocks in the last two years, then it did benefit his game in terms of preparation; Buttler believes playing for a franchise, one coached by Ricky Ponting and with Sachin Tendulkar and Jonty Rhodes in the dugout, taught him the need for greater self-reliance. \u201cGoing into a new environment with new coaches posed the question as to how well I actually know my own game. To have these big names asking what I want from them, and what makes me tick, showed me how selfish you have to be with your practice. You have to demand from them what you believe will get the best out of yourself, rather than be told what to do.\u201d While the focus was naturally on performing for his employer, Buttler did take the time to tap up Ponting, the former Australia captain, for advice on how best to break back into Test cricket. The feedback was mental, rather than technical, and reaffirmed his own suspicion that during last summer\u2019s Ashes series, when he averaged 15.25 with the bat, his focus was all wrong. \u201cI had a bit of a chat with Ricky and his advice was about understanding your game and taking ownership of it. No one can do it for you, it\u2019s down to you. That\u2019s what you notice about the top players at the IPL, they have that belief and trust in their own ability. \u201cMy Test career started well and I was happy but in the Ashes I fell away. I went away from what I do well. I was worrying about how Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson or Josh Hazlewood would get me out and how I would counter it, but in doing that forgot how I was going to score runs and put pressure on them, which is what I\u2019m good at.

Investigators believe that a rival gunman, who had shot at them before, had been spotted at the Hilltop Mall in Richmond, California. As a leader of the group at the centre of the worst gun violence the city had ever seen, Robinson was known for his readiness to go after his enemies. In the words of one officer, he was a \u201cserial killer\u201d. The target, Brian Jones, pulled out of the mall parking lot in his car, according to court records. Moments later, Robinson\u2019s car rolled up alongside him. A volley of shots missed Jones, but LaQuisha Turner, his 17-year-old girlfriend, was hit in the face and neck. The injury left her paralysed from the neck down and unable to breathe without a ventilator. Over the next three months, a retaliatory cycle played out that resulted in as many as a dozen murders. The following year, the feud between two warring groups, Deep C, based in Central Richmond, and Project Trojans, from North Richmond, led to more than 20 killings. City officials were desperate to stem the violence, and the groundwork was laid for an experimental programme that would focus on mentoring the young men most likely to kill or be killed. Set up in 2007 and primarily staffed by ex-convicts, the Office of Neighbourhood Safety (ONS) pioneered an unusual approach: it would provide men who had gun crime convictions with incentives to stop shooting. At first, ONS gave them social services referrals and life-skills training to find jobs and earn degrees. Three years later, and more controversially, it offered them a monthly cash stipend and supervised trips outside Richmond. The year ONS was founded, Richmond, which lies north of Berkeley in the East Bay, across the water from San Francisco, was the ninth-most-dangerous city in the United States, with 47 murders among its 106,000 residents \u2013 more than 11 times the murder rate of New York City. In 2014, the number dropped to 11. This was the lowest on record since 1971. (The total rose again in 2015, up to 20.) Murder rates have declined nationwide over the past two decades, but the 77% drop in Richmond is a statistical outlier. Over the same 2007-14 period, homicides in Oakland and New York City fell by about a third. The success of what soon became known as the \u201cRichmond model\u201d has generated a certain amount of media hype, and attracted the interest of other communities struggling with gun violence. Few people dispute that the ONS has made an impact on the streets where it started. But the notion that a successful publicly funded programme like this could one day persuade the government to attempt something similar on a much larger scale was bound to be unpopular in certain quarters. Gun violence is the result of multiple forces coming together. Though it is possible to make a causal link between, say, the availability of firearms and deaths by shooting, when the number of deaths goes down, it is harder to identify a single reason. The positive influence ex-convicts may wield over the people pulling the triggers is hard to prove. So how much responsibility can the programme rightfully claim for Richmond\u2019s turnaround? * * * Rohnell Robinson, now 30, spent two years in jail, and has been out since 2009. On a cold morning in February 2014, ONS staff member Sam Vaughn drove me and Robinson through the Iron Triangle, a low-income neighbourhood bordered by two sets of train tracks. Billboards for Chevron, the area\u2019s largest employer, alternated with signs that threatened jail time for buying a gun on behalf of anyone without a licence. Corner liquor stores were open, and little else. Bernice\u2019s Chicken Spot, once a favourite haunt of Robinson\u2019s, was boarded up. So was his grandmother\u2019s house. A police car idled on a corner, \u201cjust waiting\u201d, Robinson said, \u201cfor something to happen\u201d. On block after block, residential windows were cloaked in sheets and front yards sealed off by wire fencing. The pavements were empty. As we passed the Barretts, a gated apartment complex, Robinson reminisced about how it used to be possible to \u201cchill and get away from everything\u201d there, back when shootouts with North Richmond sometimes happened three or four times in a single day.   Related: A radical approach to gun crime: paying people not to kill each other    \u201cThis is where I\u2019m cool,\u201d Robinson said, scanning the street. \u201cDeep Central, my comfort zone.\u201d He sat low in the passenger seat, despite the car\u2019s tinted glass; strict laws prohibit him from returning home to Central Richmond and associating with anyone considered a gang member in the neighbourhood. In the wake of the LaQuisha Turner shooting, the state attorney general\u2019s office launched an investigation into Deep C that culminated in a November 2008 sweep by local and federal officers. Eighteen members were arrested, and police confiscated cash, drugs and automatic weapons. A female associate employed as a juvenile counsellor with the city parks and recreation department was found with a kilo of cocaine and a MAC-11 rifle. By then, Robinson was already in custody. One of the attempted murder charges against Robinson was dropped, owing to lack of evidence, but a gun possession charge stuck, and he was sentenced to five years in prison.  Although he accepted the charge against him in order to get out of jail, Robinson denies that he was part of a gang. By his account, he never shared his drug earnings with anyone, never donned colours or threw hand signs, and was never \u201cjumped in\u201d \u2013 beaten up by a group to gain initiation. That kind of \u201cBloods and Crips stuff was in LA\u201d, he said. What mattered in Richmond was where you grew up and who your friends were. If there was a problem, you looked out for your partners, \u201clike someone takes care of their family\u201d. Four years ago, when he broke probation rules in order to take his four-year-old nephew to a playground in Central Richmond, someone spotted him and tipped off the police, who swept in and cuffed him in front of the boy. Some of the arresting officers had seen him just the day before, at a truancy programme where he was counselling young people as part of his ONS fellowship.   Related: Gun violence in Chicago: a struggle for answers in Obama's hometown    \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cYou want a young man to be responsible to his community and his family, to make up for their mistakes.\u201d Robinson sighed. \u201cMy name just gets me in trouble.\u201d \u201cI think they believe he doesn\u2019t deserve anything better due to what he did prior,\u201d Vaughn reflected. He looked at me in the rearview mirror, but the message was for Robinson. \u201cThey think, \u2018If we had that evidence, we could put him in jail forever, so let\u2019s make his life as hard as we can.\u2019 So as far as revenge and retaliation, they\u2019re doing the exact same thing these young men are doing.\u201d Vaughn, 39, speaks from experience. A former cocaine dealer who hustled on the streets of North Richmond, a square-mile tract of derelict homes and projects, he spent 10 years in prison (seven in San Quentin) for pistol whipping a man almost to death. In prison, men he had looked up to on the street challenged him to stop wasting time. So Vaughn joined men\u2019s groups, worked at the church, and talked to the troubled youths who came to visit the prison as part of a programme. While incarcerated, he earned a degree and, less than a year after his release, in 2008, he was hired by Richmond\u2019s ONS to cultivate relationships with young offenders. His criminal history gave him credibility with his charges; he could be the model for them that he had never found for himself. \u201cI decided that I\u2019m going to live for them,\u201d he told me. Robinson first heard about the ONS from his mother while he was in prison. Though qualified to take part in the programme, he initially balked, worrying that his former associates would consider any link to the authorities tantamount to snitching. After talking to ONS staff, he changed his mind: they told him they did not share information with the police. In mid-2011, he accepted an invitation to join a pilot ONS programme.     Pedestrians cross the railway lines that mark the border of the Iron Triangle neighbourhood of Richmond, which is known for its high crime rate. Photograph: Balazs Gardi for the Guardian    Vaughn and Robinson got to know each other on an ONS trip to Dallas. Both men are Dallas Cowboys fans, and they visited the team\u2019s new stadium together. Robinson told me that Vaughn\u2019s advice helped him adapt to life after jail. Vaughn called regularly, and reliably replied to text messages. Woman trouble, finding an apartment, paying a phone bill \u2013 nothing was too mundane for his attention. The men\u2019s mutual respect evolved into a friendship. \u201cI\u2019m not telling him how he should live his life,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cI\u2019m just giving him some options.\u201d Fifteen months into his fellowship, Robinson was charged with credit card fraud. He had got involved in a scheme purchasing stolen credit card numbers from a third party in order to buy Target gift cards and max them out. Vaughn advised him to turn himself in, which he did, then wrote a letter to the judge outlining his progress in the programme. Robinson did not lose his place in the fellowship, in spite of this and other probation violations. \u201cThey expect you to give up on them, and we refuse to do that,\u201d Vaughn said. * * * The ONS headquarters sits on the third floor of a brick building that was once a jail. You have to knock to get inside, as the wrong mix of people could get ugly. When I visited in the spring of 2014 to meet the director, DeVone Boggan, the lounge table was stacked with copies of Sports Illustrated and Black Entrepreneur. A sign taped to a wall read: \u201cI Support DeVone Boggan and The ONS.\u201d Boggan, who is 49, wore a houndstooth hat tilted over his piercing blue eyes. He had been working at a consulting firm specialising in youth mentoring in Oakland, 12 miles away, before he was hired to advise Richmond\u2019s violence prevention department. Richmond officials had been spending millions on violence prevention programmes that did not produce results. It did not take Boggan long to see that trust in law enforcement was low and community services were poor. He became convinced that the only way the city would be able to combat the violence was through an agency not associated with law enforcement. Boggan launched the Office of Neighbourhood Safety in 2007, with a small staff of outreach workers, all but one of them ex-convicts. They focused their efforts on Richmond\u2019s Central district, less than five square miles in size. More than half of the 47 killings the previous year were in this area. Just three firearms-related homicides were recorded in the same area a year later; the conflict was now concentrated in the sprawling Southside, where a patchwork of cliques affiliated with the Project Trojans and Deep C fought. The shift suggested that focused, consistent attention worked. But the next year, the ONS\u2019s staff of four \u201cchange agents\u201d, as they are called, was stretched thin trying to cover both the central and southern districts, and the death toll surged to 45. At a meeting with law enforcement officials, Boggan was stunned to learn that some 70% of the 45 homicides and 200-plus firearm assaults in 2009 were suspected of having been committed by just 17 people. He reckoned that if the perpetrators could somehow be engaged directly and intensely, in a spirit of partnership, gun violence would plummet. ONS agents spent hours in the neighbourhoods most affected by gun violence. They played dominoes or basketball, and talked to people. The information they collected was used to develop a focus group of 50 candidates. More \u201ctouches\u201d were made with the prospects until rapport was built, and they would be offered a spot in the 18-month, voluntary Operation Peacemaker Fellowship. To win the first recruits over and keep them coming back, Boggan knew he had to impress them. On arriving at the city manager\u2019s conference room, the candidates were given a sit-down lunch; every place setting had a plaque on which the guest\u2019s name was engraved. Dressed in a pinstripe suit, Boggan made his pitch: if the city was going to live in peace, he said, it would have to come through the men in that room. If they agreed to participate in the fellowship, which included drawing up a \u201clife map\u201d detailing career and family goals, he told them the $1,000 cheque they received at the end of the meeting would be just the beginning. Four of the men invited to this meeting had refused straight off; they flashed guns under their belts and announced that the police would have to earn their pay. But the rest agreed to join.    Some 70% of the 45 homicides and 200-plus firearm assaults in 2009 were suspected of having been committed by 17 people    In a city with scant economic opportunities for law-abiding people, ONS was criticised for rewarding criminals with taxpayers\u2019 money, or \u201cpaying for peace\u201d. Courtland \u201cCorky\u201d Booz\u00e9, a former member of the city council, argued that more deserving ex-convicts could be bypassed for not being dangerous enough, adding that the ONS had not been transparent in showing how it spends its money. Another community leader complained to me that the programme was spending too much on lavish trips in which the ratio of staff to fellows was about equal. Boggan explained that although ONS received $1.2 million from the city for its operating budget in 2014, the money for the stipend and travel comes exclusively from private donors. Fellows are eligible for payment and travel privileges only after six months, and to earn the full $1,000 payment each month thereafter, they must fulfil the goals on their life map. Fewer than half of programme fellows have received the full amount, and Boggan has cut a lot of cheques made out for a single dollar. He added that the money given to the fellows is a pittance compared with what Richmond police department must pay for overtime, or what the city pays for the cost of a criminal trial, or medevac helicopter rides to take shooting victims to hospitals. The programme\u2019s record is remarkable: of the 68 fellows who have taken part so far, 64 are still alive, and Boggan asserts that it is a result of better decision-making on the part of the participants. \u201cOur theory of change is simple,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to desire to live.\u201d Nearly 10 months after Boggan started the ONS, his younger brother Dhanthan, then 32, was shot dead in Michigan. Boggan went home for the funeral. His brother\u2019s friends told him they knew who did it and asked Boggan if they should retaliate. He told them that the police would handle it. Yet he found the officers helpless, unable to answer basic questions. At the memorial service, the man who was rumoured to have shot his brother turned up and offered condolences. Boggan was enraged. He advanced his return flight, knowing that if he didn\u2019t, he might do something he would regret. \u201cI\u2019m the neighbourhood safety director with all the abilities to know better, and I\u2019m feeling this way,\u201d he recalled, \u201ctelling myself on the flight, \u2018You could have done something. You could have done something.\u2019\u201d * * * Richmond, with its five oil refineries and three chemical plants, sits on the east side of the bay, its industry-heavy economy mostly impervious to the tech boom in San Francisco. Chimneys and knots of petroleum piping punctuate the skyline. Local activists say that steady pollution from the Chevron refinery accelerated an exodus of the city\u2019s once-sizeable middle class and kept would-be investors away, leaving a majority black and Latino population. Industrial accidents have plagued the community, notably a 2012 refinery fire that sent more than 15,000 area residents to medical centres with respiratory ailments in a single afternoon. Child hospitalisation rates are nearly twice the state average. But the tough circumstances have attracted ambitious and dedicated politicians. In 2006, Green party progressives took over the city council and have since enacted policies more radical than anything in famously liberal Berkeley \u2013 including a compulsory purchase campaign to bail out homeowners and forgive debt, and a \u201cban the box\u201d ordinance that forbids employers from requiring job applicants to reveal their criminal histories. The city also hired Chris Magnus, an openly gay police chief from North Dakota, who helped to reform the police force (he departed for Tuscon, Arizona late last year). \u201cRichmond to me is a story of pragmatism,\u201d said Barry Krisberg, a criminologist at the University of California in Berkeley. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to step away from a purely ideological, moralistic approach to try new things and see what works.\u201d Krisberg told me that Richmond\u2019s worst cycles of violence, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, then again in the mid-2000s, coincided with a deluge of crack cocaine on the streets. The surge a decade ago was compounded by cuts in state budgets that resulted in mass prisoner releases and a shortfall in funding for parole and re-entry programmes. Lifelong criminals with no prospects of legitimate work went back to making a living in the drug trade while police tried, without success, according to Krisberg, \u201cto arrest their way out of the problem\u201d.     Richmond, with its five oil refineries and three chemical plants, sits on the east side of the bay, its industry-heavy economy mostly impervious to the tech boom in San Francisco across the water. Photograph: Balazs Gardi for the Guardian    As with other cities across the country, there have been many reasons for the decline in violent crime, Krisberg said. Gentrifiers and working-class immigrants attracted by some of the lowest rents in the Bay Area have had a generally restorative effect. More money is being spent to upgrade schools and after-school programmes; playgrounds have fresh coats of paint. The chief of police has also taken steps to win local trust by orienting his force towards community policing. Magnus instated a gun buy-back programme that incentivised people to trade in weapons for gift cards, and gave officers more regular patrol beats, dispensing with aggressive street sweeps and multiple arrests. ONS\u2019s role in the reduction of violence is difficult to quantify, but in July 2015, the National Council on Crime &amp; Delinquency published a long-term study of the programme concluding that it appears to be working. \u201cMost social service programmes do not count outcomes such as mortality or injury,\u201d the report acknowledged, but \u201cusing these measures is paramount for an effort designed to reduce lethal violence.\u201d Still, the NCCD hedged: \u201cIt is impossible to disentangle the ONS approach from other concurrent city-wide violence reduction interventions.\u201d For ONS detractors, the infamous \u201cCity Hall Brawl\u201d was evidence that the programme\u2019s grip on its charges was tenuous. On 14 October 2011, members of two rival groups showed up to collect their stipends at the same time. After trading insults in the parking lots, they went to the ONS office , where only administrative staff were present, and a melee broke out. Local and national media picked up the story after a police report was leaked that included the allegation from a responding officer that ONS staff had impeded the investigation. The timing of the leaks underscored the aversion some within the police department felt, and continue to feel, toward the ONS. No charges were brought. Police officers involved in the event were reluctant to speak about it. But Detective Matt Anderson acknowledged that residual tensions from the incident have not entirely subsided in the department. He added that there has never been any formal training inside the department about the particular nature of the ONS\u2019s work: \u201cI think it\u2019s all a misunderstanding.\u201d For his part, Booz\u00e9, the former councilman, refuses to let the City Hall incident go. \u201cWhat if one of the men had drawn a gun and accidentally shot a girl,\u201d he exclaimed when we met at Casper\u2019s Hot Dog stand, opposite City Hall. \u201cMaybe [the ONS is] doing something, they are talking to people,\u201d he conceded. But its strategies still rankled. \u201cI\u2019ve said it a thousand times: I\u2019m a little upset about having to pay people to stop shooting each other. Because in the community I come from, if you give someone the opportunity to take advantage of you, they will.\u201d Yet there is evidence that this is not the case. Research by GiveWell, an American non-profit organisation that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of charities, suggests that a little money can have a disproportionate impact on people living in dire circumstances. In a survey of hundreds of charities, they found direct cash transfers \u201chave the strongest track record\u201d for most interventions. * * * Of all the perks offered by the ONS programme, trips outside Richmond are the most coveted. With funding from private foundations such as the California Endowment and Kaiser Permanente, and the California Wellness Foundation, the ONS has taken fellows on all-expense paid journeys to New York and Washington DC, and as far as Dubai and South Africa. Fellows are treated to steak dinners and four-star hotels, and given access to professional athletes and politicians on Capitol Hill. There is just one caveat: they must agree to travel with a rival. In May 2014, Vaughn let me tag along on a day trip to Marin County with Robinson and Rasheed Shepherd, a former fellow from the Southside who was once known for wielding an outsized Desert Eagle pistol. The first time the rivals had travelled together, to Texas for the evangelical preacher TD Jakes\u2019 ManPower conference, neither wanted to sit in the front seat for fear of having the other behind him. On the drive to the airport, Vaughn had thought, \u201cThis a huge mistake\u201d. A conversation about football relieved some of the pressure, but it was not until they were on the plane that they gave up their posturing, too airsick to care. Seventeen hundred miles from Richmond, they realised they had more in common than not. \u201cWe were having fun, and it was like, damn, this guy isn\u2019t that bad \u2013 he\u2019s cool,\u201d Robinson said. In Marin, the plan was to go horse riding. Robinson led, yanking the reins and digging his heels. In the rear, Shepherd worried aloud that he didn\u2019t want to hurt the animal. When we stopped for lunch at Point Reyes Station, Robinson excused himself to call his girlfriend, to whom he marvelled that a place so serene was no more than an hour\u2019s drive from Richmond. Our final destination was Drake\u2019s Bay, where we sampled the oysters. I bought a half-dozen and clumsily demonstrated how to open them. Robinson looked on as Shepherd, cringing, slurped one down. It was hard to believe that there had been a time when the mere sight of each other could have prompted them to draw their guns. \u201cWe\u2019re talking ambulance and a fatal situation,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cSurvival of the fittest,\u201d Shepherd agreed. I asked if they considered themselves friends now. They hesitated, each waiting for the other to speak. More like \u201cassociates\u201d, Robinson started, with a \u201cdifferent type of understanding\u201d. \u201cJust because we get along doesn\u2019t mean his other 10 friends are gonna be cool with me,\u201d Shepherd said. Each said they had caught flak for travelling with people from the wrong part of town, although, Robinson said: \u201cThe same folks will turn around later and go, \u2018Yo, how can I get on one of those trips?\u2019\u201d    It was hard to believe there'd been a time when the mere sight of each other could have prompted them to draw their guns    Vaughn and I sat by ourselves for a while at a picnic table, and he informed me that the decision to pair Robinson and Shepherd had been strategic; they each had status on the street, and a rapprochement could ease the tension between their groups. When ONS first proposed that the two men travel together, Vaughn promised them that although they would probably feel uncomfortable, they would never be unsafe. This was their six or seventh trip, and \u201cthey no longer see themselves locked in war\u201d, Vaughn said. The light was starting to fade. In front of us, Robinson and Shepherd were standing together at the water\u2019s edge, skipping oyster shells. * * * By the end of 2014, Richmond had recorded the lowest murder rate in the city\u2019s history. At an annual community memorial for homicide victims, held on the steps of the library, the outgoing mayor, Gayle McLaughlin, declared that Richmond\u2019s \u201cold reputation is dying off\u201d and commended the ONS for its work with the city\u2019s youth. When it was Boggan\u2019s turn to speak, he thanked the young men \u201chistorically responsible for gun violence\u201d for making better decisions about how they \u201cnavigate everyday conflicts\u201d. Nevertheless, the new year began badly: on the evening of 13 January, 23-year-old Sirmonte \u201cSirdy\u201d Bernstine, a promising rapper from a Richmond family well-known to law enforcement, was killed in a triple shooting in the Southside Crescent Park apartments. Within a week, 10 people were arrested, eight of them on gun possession charges, as police sought to pre-empt retaliation that was being threatened on Facebook and Instagram. Two weeks later, Keyon Wilson, 21, and Lamarea Mims, 23, brothers from Crescent Park, were shot dead in Vallejo in the space of eight hours. As usual, Vaughn and the ONS staff went to the funeral. Robinson had known Sirdy since he was a boy. Several weeks before his death, they hung out in the recording studio as Sirdy finished his album. \u201cMan, I love him \u2013 what I don\u2019t love is his decision-making,\u201d Robinson told me in April. \u201cBut I can\u2019t judge him, \u2019cause that was me.\u201d In the days after the shooting, Robinson knew that people around Richmond were speculating on whether or not he might seek revenge. His stress increased after the Crescent Park brothers were killed because he had been on good terms with their clique. Now both sides were potential liabilities: if he showed solidarity with one, the other might come at him. He decamped to Los Angeles for a few days to let the situation cool down.

Photograph: Balazs Gardi for the Guardian    When he returned, we had lunch at his favourite Vietnamese restaurant. The place was on the border between Central and Southside, the kind of spot where you might run into someone you don\u2019t want to see. In white jeans and a sweatshirt, with diamond studs in his ears, Robinson sat facing the door, more out of habit than nerves. Hustling ran in the family, Robinson told me. His grandfather was a prominent coke dealer in the 1980s, whose arrest, during which Robinson was in the car, was featured in a documentary. His stepfather cut him in on his first drug deal when he was 12, and he was caught by police at 14. In his teens, he and a group of friends protected a block in the heart of the Iron Triangle against a group of men twice their age. He remembered the early days fondly. Marijuana and cocaine were the main products. Robinson could make as much as $1,000 a day. Robberies grew with profits, and he started carrying a gun when he was in high school. And yet, barring the occasional street fight, he said, gun violence was rare. The feuding started with a car accident. A man from North Richmond collided with a man from Central as he pulled out of a driveway. He agreed to pay for damages, but later reneged and was killed. Before long, a personal dispute erupted into a neighbourhood conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s been on ever since,\u201d Robinson said. At one funeral, a man was shot in the face. One day in March 2005, Robinson\u2019s closest friend, 18-year-old Byron Mott, was shot. The week before, he had been cheering Robinson on the football field. The incident was a turning point, Robinson told me: the moment he \u201clost it\u201d. More than 10 of his friends have perished over the years. I asked if his course might have been different had he found ONS as a teenager. \u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell a youngster nothing.\u201d Back when he was a \u201cbig factor\u201d in Central, he had houses, expensive clothing, and a reputation for toughness. When he got out of jail, there was only his girlfriend and his friends at ONS. \u201cEverything was ass-backwards, and they helped me see farther.\u201d He said he felt grateful. \u201cThis is once-in-a-lifetime help, man. I\u2019m smart at the end of the day, not stupid.\u201d Robinson drove me back to downtown Richmond in a late-model black Dodge Charger that reeked of pot. He was still hustling a little here and there, he told me, but he swore he was \u201cdone with the hardcore street stuff\u201d. He and his girlfriend had recently moved to a gated apartment in a suburb where nobody knows him. And in a few weeks\u2019 time, he was scheduled for a hearing to end his probation early, which, if it happened, would allow him to travel without restrictions \u2013 or leave the area altogether. * * * Lt Arnold Threets used to chase Robinson back in the days when Deep C accounted for more than half the 300 reported shootings in Richmond. \u201cIf you thought of any dirt that was happening in the city at the time, Rohnell Robinson\u2019s name came up,\u201d he told me. Threets, who is African-American, is a former marine with more than 25 years on the force. He was sceptical when he heard about the ONS experiment; many idealists had come and gone. Safety on the streets wasn\u2019t just a matter of making nice with violent offenders and encouraging police to do the same. Boggan told me that he spent months courting Threets because he respected his intelligence and savvy. He figured that if Threets came around, anything was possible. Eventually, he won the officer over. \u201cDeVone got my trust because he wasn\u2019t a bunny hugger,\u201d Threets told me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t telling me these guys aren\u2019t dangerous.\u201d The Richmond police department gained notoriety in the 1980s for a thuggish group of white officers who wore boots and called themselves \u201cThe Cowboys\u201d. Brutal police beatings of African Americans led to multimillion-dollar civil rights settlements with victims. Threets, who arrived after the scandal, stressed that tactful, community-oriented policing has helped the department recover from the mistrust induced by that period. \u201cWe play hard but we play clean,\u201d he said. According to department records for 2015, officers used force in about 6% of arrests and received 12 complaints about use of force.     A Richmond neighbourhood mentor intervenes in a dispute. Photograph: Brian L. Frank for Mother Jones    The Richmond police department is officially aligned with Operation Ceasefire, which holds night walks through violent neighbourhoods and hosts events for troubled youth. If police work has become more surgical, Threets said, it\u2019s because lowering homicides is the top priority and most of the killings are committed by a handful of shooters. \u201cThis is where it gets a little dirty,\u201d he told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t care so much if you messed with credit cards. As long as you were going to stop killing people, I could work with you.\u201d The trouble is that there exists a newer crop of shooters for whom scams and drug dealing are less of a priority. They don\u2019t care about the money; they want the respect that comes from seeking vengeance without showing remorse. Not all the shooters were converted by the programme. Robinson was unusual. \u201cHe got it, man. Not overnight, but it clicked,\u201d Threets said. Robinson\u2019s progress visibly moved him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to realise who Rohnell Robinson was \u2013 it\u2019s like Al Capone finding Jesus.\u201d Threets said that there have been a number of poorly managed social programmes that have allowed participants to \u201ctake advantage of our collective good intentions\u201d, and hustle the system. He has no evidence that this is the case with the ONS. \u201cIronically, the level of public scrutiny they receive has guarded them from these types of abuses,\u201d he said. In his view, criticism of the programme mainly comes from people who refuse to face complex reality. \u201cONS has been successful, albeit not perfect, where others have failed,\u201d Threets said. \u201cThat kind of success can engender a good dose of envy, and has the potential to divert resources away from other traditional methods for addressing urban violence.\u201d Resistance to the ONS method may also reflect a more broadly American stigma against handouts. While the use of tangible incentives such as cash stipends and travel are very much in line with prevailing capitalist values, the very act of giving them away for free \u2013 especially to those who may still operate outside of society\u2019s lawful boundaries \u2013 would seem to conflict with a deep-seated ethos in our culture that opportunity must extend from merit. \u201cI would tend to agree [ex-felons like Robinson] don\u2019t necessarily deserve the ONS fellowship,\u201d Threets conceded. \u201cBut \u2026 by definition mercy is something you receive that is unmerited.\u201d * * * When I arrived at the gate for our flight to Seattle on another ONS trip, no two members of the Richmond crew were sitting together. The fellows were scattered around, playing with their phones. Boggan, Vaughn, and Kevin Muccular, an agent much loved for his warmth and humour, knew better than to enforce a group dynamic. They would ride to the downtown Hilton in a white Mercedes Benz SUV, eat at a restaurant, and attend an exhibition of Marcel Duchamp at the Seattle Art Museum, with detours to serve dinner at a soup kitchen and visit a youth group in a poor part of town. Robinson was not coming. Boggan told me, smiling, that he had been offered overtime at work. Boggan had many reasons to be upbeat. He had recently become director of Richmond\u2019s ailing recreation department. The position gave the ONS a network with which to attract and serve at-risk youth before delinquent behaviour turned into felonies. A new 18-month fellowship was under way and the participants were younger than before. It was a sign that the programme is \u201cselling itself\u201d, Boggan said.     North Richmond. The community is the poorest in Contra Costa County. Photograph: Balazs Gardi for the Guardian    Indeed, consulting opportunities for Boggan and the ONS staff were multiplying around the country, from Miami Gardens, Florida, to Toledo, Ohio. In March, the Washington DC city council unanimously voted to adopt a version of the Richmond programme, in response to a wave of homicides there last year. But it is still a contentious matter. Mayor Muriel E Bowser insists that the programme has not been properly evaluated, and refused to allocate funds in her proposed 2017 budget. Members of the council counter that they will shift money from the mayor\u2019s other law-enforcement priorities to get the programme running. In March, Boggan stepped down from his ONS post to develop a national non-profit organisation, Advance Peace. He will continue to consult city governments, including Richmond. While some private-sector funding has clearly served the Richmond programme well, allowing the ONS to defend its controversial stipends and trips, I wondered what would be lost if such social services are not publicly supported. Boggan said the programme needed to be adapted in ways that \u201cmake the best sense for each city working on it\u201d. Rasheed Shepherd gestured me over. Nearly a year had passed since our trip to Marin County, and he stood to greet me. He had left Richmond for Sacramento several months before, he told me on the plane. His girlfriend had landed a job at the post office. He could look after his five-year-old son now without concern over which blocks were off-limits. \u201cWe just get on our bikes and ride,\u201d he said. Calls still came in from Southside associates grumbling about the latest drama, but, Shepherd said, he had \u201cgrown up\u201d and lost interest. Many friends remained incarcerated. The frequent calls he received from them, guys who used to hassle him for dealing with the ONS, kept him focused. His experiences on the outside had given them a glimpse of a better life. Plus, he added, they needed him to keep their phone cards full. \u201cTruth is, I can\u2019t go back to the way I was even if I wanted to,\u201d he said. He ticked off the destinations he had visited with the programme: New York, Dubai, South Africa. The last time he visited Seattle was for a firefighting workshop, part of a merchant-marine training course that the ONS sponsored. \u201cWhen you start doing things folks said you\u2019d never do, when you start seeing things done the right way, you think, man, that\u2019s a great way to live,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t make excuses no more.\u201d * * *  In early May 2015, Robinson had a probation hearing at the county court house. It was a bad day. The judge postponed his decision until he had a chance to review Robinson\u2019s brimming case files in full. Robinson was cruising back on the I-580 highway, not far from where LaQuisha Turner was shot, when a black car pulled up along side him, and a window started to drop. He ducked as a barrage of bullets sent the car into a guardrail. Robinson was unharmed; the Charger was written off. He did not report the shooting: if word got back to the authorities, he reasoned, his chances of getting off probation would be jeopardised. But news of the drive-by reached the district attorney\u2019s office anyway. At his second hearing, the judge grilled him about the incident, which he took to be a sign of continued gang activity, and ordered Robinson to formally register with Richmond police as a gang member. At the news, Robinson\u2019s temper flared. He shouted all the way to the street, where office workers peeked at him from their windows. Vaughn, who had accompanied him, let him finish before responding. \u201cWhat they just said is that you\u2019re an animal. And you can\u2019t even take it, a little criticism. You get all upset. You know what that tells a reasonable person. \u2018Damn, if he responds like this, how would he respond if that happened.\u2019 You helping them out. Cut it out.\u201d \u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of getting treated like this, man.\u201d \u201cI get it. But you\u2019re in an arena where you don\u2019t understand how it works. At least pay attention to folks that do, bro. You were supposed to keep your face straight and your mouth shut, that was your only job. And you couldn\u2019t even do that.\u201d Robinson paced back and forth, cursing and fiddling with his paperwork. \u201cYou can\u2019t say nothing right; everything is wrong.\u201d Vaughn stayed in step next to him, puffing a Newport. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day that judge gonna go with what the fuck the DA say,\u201d Robinson insisted. \u201cYou been in the system, you know this shit.\u201d \u201cWhen I was in the system,\u201d Vaughn replied, \u201cI was playing a victim and I was angry and I looked just like you. And who the fuck wants that living next door to them? Anger has no place in that room bro, it just doesn\u2019t. You lose your argument. And I know that\u2019s hard, and I know that\u2019s frustrating. And I know it\u2019s a game we ain\u2019t used to playing. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s a game we always fucking lose.\u201d Several weeks later, Robinson\u2019s last attempt at a probation dismissal was denied, meaning he would have to wait even longer before he can get free and clear of his Richmond stalkers, as well as the associates urging him to pick up his pistol and strike back. The last time I saw him, he was in his suburban apartment. His mother and baby nephew were visiting to celebrate a birthday. He told me he had no idea who was responsible for the highway shooting. I understood that even if Robinson knew, he would never say so. That part of his street code held firm. For the moment, he seemed at peace. We stepped onto a porch with a view of rolling hills and cypress trees. \u201cWhen the storm comes, it comes,\u201d he told me with a shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, though. I just don\u2019t want to fight it any more. I\u2019m gonna leave it alone.\u201d I believed Robinson; vengeance no longer drove him. But his enemies were many, and carrying such debts as his always ended badly in Richmond. Real freedom demanded a self-imposed exile, from home and family and his old identity. Sooner or later, he would have to leave Richmond for good.

The mood is... Quietly optimistic. France usually do well on home soil. Michel Platini inspired us to a Euro 84 victory in Parc des Princes and the quality of Fabien Barthez, Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry won us the 1998 World Cup in Stade de France. We\u2019re hoping for new heroes this summer. There\u2019s great potential in midfield and up front, but the defence remains our Achilles\u2019 heel. You could say that it\u2019s EvraSagnastrophic. Our group looks relatively straightforward, though. The quarter-final will be the key game, no matter what team France face. Anything less than a semi-final place would be a disappointment. Keep an eye out for... Antoine Griezmann should enjoy himself in the group stage. He\u2019s had a terrific season for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The strength of Paul Pogba will be important in midfield and I expect Anthony Martial to turn a few heads. The loss of defender Rapha\u00ebl Varane is a disaster. Someone else will need to step up at the back. At least goalkeeper Hugo Lloris looks one of the tournament\u2019s strongest. And England? You have produced the greatest underdogs of league football in the past: Nottingham Forest, Ipswich and now Leicester City. So let\u2019s wait and see what happens. Albania     Endrit Metolli celebrates after Albania secure a place at Euro 2016.       Albania fans. Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images    Endrit Metolli is an 18-year-old student whose family are Albanians from Pristina, Kosovo. The mood is... Buzzing. Albanian football fans can\u2019t wait for the games to start. It\u2019s the first time my country is taking part in a major tournament. It will be amazing to finally see our team playing on such a big stage. We believe we can progress from the group. There\u2019s cause for optimism because... We were strong in qualifying. We beat Portugal away and drew both games against Denmark. We didn\u2019t concede a goal away from home, so hopefully we\u2019ll be as tough to beat. The domestic league in Albania isn\u2019t very popular \u2013 everyone supports stronger teams from the leagues in England, Spain and Italy \u2013 but at the beginning of the 2015-16 season Skenderbeu, a team from the city of Korce, became the first Albanian team to reach the last qualifying round of the Champions League, and then the Europa League. This gained the support of all Albanians, no matter what city or team they supported. It was all new to us and a historic moment in our country\u2019s footballing history.   Related: Euro 2016: the complete guide to every squad and every player in France    The game I\u2019m most looking forward to is... Our final group game against Switzerland. They have a few players with Albanian backgrounds. Unusually, the two brothers Taulant Xhaka and Granit Xhaka will be facing each other. Hopefully our dream of getting through the group stage is still alive after the first two games. I plan to watch the games at the same local pub where hundreds of Albanians watched the qualifying matches. The atmosphere in there is just like being in a stadium. When Euro 2016 qualification was confirmed, we all ran out and began celebrating in the street with loud music and car horns. Keep an eye out for... Our captain and defensive wall Lorik Cana. He turned down chances to play for other European national teams just so he could play for the country of his origin.He was the first Albanian to score in the Premier League during a short spell at Sunderland. Cana is crucial to our hopes this summer. He has a great influence on our younger players. Lazio goalkeeper Etrit Berisha also needs to have a good tournament. Romania     Ian Browne.       Romania midfielder Lucian Sanmartean. Photograph: Daniel Mihailescu/AFP/Getty Images    Ian Browne was born in Bolton, but married a Romanian and settled in Bucharest. He watches Dinamo Bucharest regularly but also keeps track of Burnley\u2019s results, having been a supporter since the 1970s.  Romania is... A good place to live. Not a great place, but definitely a good place. The people are friendly. One legacy of the communist education system is that everyone over 40 has read Dickens and Dostoyevsky, and can tell Beethoven from Brahms. People manage to be simultaneously both proud of being Romanian and disheartened by living in Romania, which they see as beset by corrupt, self-serving and dishonest politicians. The mood is... Pessimistic. It\u2019s widely recognised the Romanian team is the weakest the country has produced in 50 years. We have as much natural ability as Northern Ireland, but none of their passion and self belief. The thought of Vlad Chiriches marking Antoine Griezmann in the opening game against France strikes fear into the heart of every Romanian. The overall level of football here is woeful. Dinamo\u2019s centre forward Harlem Gnohere was recently signed on a free transfer from Mons in the Belgian Second Division. A club such as Dinamo, with a long tradition of European success, is reduced to picking up free transfers from Europe\u2019s bargain basement.  How Romania will celebrate... Romania\u2019s national drink is Tuica. It\u2019s made from plums and is very strong. It\u2019s like drinking petrol. Romanians are very proud of it. If we avoid three defeats and get a point, there will be plenty of it going around in the bars of Bucharest. Keep an eye out for... Lucian Sanmartean, our 36-year-old creative talisman who plays for Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps the best overall player in the squad is Mihai Pintili of Steaua Bucurest, but my favourite player is Gabriel Torje. He wears his heart on his sleeve. In an age when many footballers are accused of being mercenaries, our players at least look as though they regard it as an honour to be selected for the national team, rather than an opportunity to raise their market value. Our secret weapon, if it goes to penalties, is defender Cosmin Moti, who went in goal for Ludogorets for the last five minutes of a Champions League play-off game against Steaua. In the penalty shootout, he scored the first for Ludogorets and then saved two. Switzerland     Ludovic Farine.       Will Xherdan Shaqiri, the \u2018Alpine Messi\u2019, inspire Switzerland at Euro 2016? Photograph: Jean Paul Thomas/Icon Sport via Getty Images    Ludovic Farine is from Fribourg in Switzerland. The mood is... Calm. We don\u2019t have high expectations because we don\u2019t want to be too disappointed if things go wrong. If we go beyond the group stage, we will be very happy. A place in the quarter-finals is a strong possibility, but we don\u2019t usually progress much further than that. France are the strong favourites in the group, and both Romania and Albania are capable of frustrating us defensively. I\u2019m most looking forward to seeing... Switzerland playing France in the final group game in Lille. We have a friendly rivalry with the French. Everyone likes beating their neighbours, don\u2019t they? And we want our revenge after the 5-2 defeat at the last World Cup in Brazil. We can do better than that! Keep an eye out for... My favourite player Xherdan Shaqiri. He\u2019s young, creative and scores some phenomenal goals. He\u2019s not called the \u201cAlpine Messi\u201d for nothing. England     Eric Dier will be hoping to help England\u2019s defence. Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Getty Images    Xander Wood is a 24-year-old student from London. He is going to France for the group stage. The mood is... One of excitement but with few expectations. We could be something of a dark horse if our defence clicks, but I\u2019m not holding my breath. Our lack of solid options at centre-back is worrying. Gary Cahill is our best option on paper, but he\u2019s had a terrible season at Chelsea. John Stones is promising, but playing for an Everton side that gave away leads for fun under Roberto Mart\u00ednez last season can\u2019t have been good for his confidence. Eric Dier has been a revelation as a defensive midfielder and he should help shield our back four. Against the top sides England will leak goals, and that will ultimately be our undoing. The key problem is... We have a stubborn manager. After the disappointing 2014 World Cup I don\u2019t have much faith in Roy Hodgson picking the right team. He is far too loyal to players picked before. Wayne Rooney did well in qualifying against modest opposition, but that shouldn\u2019t guarantee him a place in the starting XI and nor should his reputation. The recent friendly against Portugal showed that shoehorning him into the starting lineup means that our three most in form attacking players - Kane, Alli and Vardy have to be played out of position.Picking Jack Wilshere is also a huge gamble, with the Arsenal man having played so little football this year. The game I\u2019m most looking forward to is... England against Slovakia. I\u2019ll be in the stands at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne for the final game of the group stage. It will also be very interesting to see how we fare in the second group match against Wales \u2013 how will our fragile defence cope with an on-song Gareth Bale? Keep an eye out for... Our exciting young players. Dele Alli and Harry Kane have been on fire this season. If Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling also hit form, England should at least be dangerous in the final third. England will reach... The quarter-finals, where we\u2019ll be beaten by the first quality team we play. It\u2019s a depressing thought, given how exciting our attacking options are but in big tournaments it\u2019s much more important to be able to defend than score, especially in the knock-out stages. Slovakia     Daniela Kubikova.       Marek Hamsik, Martin Skrtel, Vladimir Weiss and Jan Durica celebrate Slovakia\u2019s third goal against Germany last month. Photograph: Alexandra Beier/Bongarts/Getty Images    Daniela Kubikova is a 20-year-old from Zilina in north-west Slovakia. The best thing about growing up in Slovakia was... Playing football with my brothers. With three of them around I was always going to fall in love with football. As a child I was a big fan of MSK Zilina. They still play in the the Fortuna Liga, the top tier in our domestic leagues. I spent many happy afternoons watching football with my dad and brothers growing up. The mood is... One of pride. We have a good group of players with excellent team spirit. Slovakia are unbeaten in their last seven international friendlies. This run includes strong wins against Switzerland and a 3-1 victory over Germany away. We still don\u2019t expect too much, but this team can exceed modest expectations if they keep playing for each other. As a unit Slovakia look strong. Keep an eye out for... Marek Hamsik is probably our biggest profile, but my favourite players are winger Robert Mak, who plays for Greek side PAOK, and Miroslav Stoch who is another creative force in the side. I still rate our captain Martin Skrtel highly too. Wales     Craig Hawes.       Ashley Williams in action against Northern Ireland. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images    Craig Hawes was born in Neath and grew up in Briton Ferry, a small village near Swansea. When I\u2019m away from Wales, I miss... The camaraderie and greenery. We\u2019re a friendly bunch overall and, with a population of just over 3 million, I think there\u2019s a camaraderie with the Welsh that bigger countries lack. I can see the Welsh and English football fans enjoying a pint together in France, when we play each other, whatever the result. I\u2019m just moving back to the UK after several years in Dubai and I\u2019ve missed the valleys and forests of home so much. And there seems to be a medieval castle in every Welsh town. You take it for granted when you live there, but Wales is teeming with history wherever you go. The mood is... Happy to have finally reached a major tournament. We haven\u2019t reached one since a solitary Pele goal knocked us out of the quarter-finals of the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. I\u2019m optimistic we can get out of our group. We will have to beat Slovakia, and hope for a point or two against England and Russia, but we can do it. I remember Ireland beating England at Euro 88 and it fills me with optimism. We\u2019re all praying... Gareth Bale stays fit. No one else in the team is on his level and he won some of our qualifiers almost single-handedly. He is without a doubt the best Welsh footballer since John Charles had a successful five-year spell with Juventus in the late 1950s and 1960s. He was once voted the club\u2019s best ever foreign player, and Bale will surely hit the same heights during his career. Keep an eye out for... The captain Ashley Williams. Despite recognising the genius of Gareth Bale, and his indispensability to the team, Ashley is criminally underrated. As a Swansea City fan, I\u2019ve enjoyed seeing him develop at the club, where he\u2019s only missed a handful of games in about eight years. To Swansea fans he\u2019s our rock, an indestructible superhero. And he\u2019s a Williams. Every Welsh sports team, whether it\u2019s rugby, football or water polo, needs a couple of them on the team sheet. Russia     Andrey Arshavin celebrates after Russia\u2019s third goal in their Euro 2008 quarter-final against Holland. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images    Stepan Puzyrnikov is a 29-year-old plating engineer from Ivanovo, central Russia. When growing up in Ivanovo... Our local football team was named Tekstilshchik Ivanovo. The name of the team is derived from the word textile, because that\u2019s the industry the city is famous for. The team has never had any money and are currently in the Russian third division. The mood is... Measured. We didn\u2019t do very well four years ago, after a fantastic display in 2008, but we all respect and support our national team. The European Championship means a great deal here. Whenever they are on, people are out on the streets watching their team play on a huge video screens, arms around shoulders and cheering. Not many Russian football fans are going to make it to France this summer, because the travelling costs are too high. But at least we won\u2019t have to go anywhere in 2018! My favourite Euro memory is... Andrey Arshavin lighting up Euro 2008 in Switzerland and Austria. He was fast and scored plenty of goals. His career stagnated a little bit at Arsenal, but he is still very popular here. We may not have an attacking partnership as lethal as Arshavin and Roman Pavlyuchenko in our current squad, but if the team sticks together we can definitely reach the knock-out stages. Germany     Thomas M\u00fcller and his Germany team-mates. Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Bongarts/Getty Images    Adrian Stein is a 19-year-old Bayern Munich supporter.  The mood is... Pretty good again. Losing Philipp Lahm, Miroslav Klose and Per Mertesacker to retirement was a hit, and there\u2019s uncertainty surrounding the fitness of Bastian Schweinsteiger. The performances in the qualifiers weren\u2019t always very convincing, but the 4-1 win against Italy in March gave us all a bit more hope. There have been some disappointing friendly defeats since then though. As has been the norm under Joachim L\u00f6w, we should reach the semi-finals. Then it\u2019s down to luck. I\u2019m hopeful but probably less so than two years ago. Germany\u2019s best group game will be... Against Poland and Robert Lewandowski. Northern Ireland and Ukraine should be relatively straightforward games, but we often have one weak showing in the group stages. If it\u2019s against Poland, Lewandowski will punish us. My favourite Germany player is... Thomas M\u00fcller. Maybe not as naturally gifted as other players in the squad, but he is capable of producing a goal when we really need it. Philipp Lahm is my favourite player of all time. Pep Guardiola said he was the smartest player he\u2019s ever worked with and I can see that. He was also a considerate, well-liked captain. Lahm\u2019s goal in the sixth minute of the 2006 World Cup opener against Costa Rica was the first time I had ever seen Germany live. Moments like that are hard to forget. After winning the group I hope we get to play... England. I have a lot of respect for the way they came back to win the recent friendly in Berlin 3-2 and think it would be a tight game, but I expect us to be more focused and sharper during a tournament. I obviously hope it\u2019ll go to penalties, because we all know what happens then. Northern Ireland     Robyn Donaldson.       Jamie Ward in action for Northern Ireland. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA    Robyn Donaldson was born in East Belfast and grew up in the Tullycarnet estate.  My interest in football comes from... My dad. He brought me and my sister along to Glentoran FC and Northern Ireland games from a young age. My favourite player was definitely David Healy. He was at his prime scoring goals against Spain and England when I was just a kid. My favourite thing about Northern Ireland is... The people. We\u2019re the most approachable bunch in the world. Over the past years our achievements in sport alone have helped put us as a country on the map. When Rory McIlroy is hitting hole-in-ones and Carl Frampton is swinging knock-out punches, we cheer together. The mood is... A mood I have never known before. Everyone is buzzing in anticipation of 12 June for our first match. This season has been the season of the underdogs in British football. Going into Euro 2016 we are massive underdogs, but the most beautiful thing about football is that anything can happen. Given our two most recent friendlies against Belarus and Slovakia extended our unbeaten run to 12 games, I have absolute faith in the team and Michael O\u2019Neill. The team has already exceeded all expectations and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of them. Our biggest challenge will be... Facing Germany. While my heart wants big Kyle Lafferty to put a few past Manuel Neuer, my head says facing the current world champions will be the sternest of tests. The key will be to get good results against Ukraine and Poland. A win and a draw in those two games might be enough to progress. My favourite Northern Ireland player is... Jamie Ward. He played exceptionally throughout the qualifying campaign. Ukraine     Ewhen Chymera.       Andriy Yarmolenko celebrates after scoring in the play-off against Slovenia in November. Photograph: Adam Nurkiewicz/Getty Images    Ewhen Chymera is a third generation Ukrainian working for Leeds council.  Growing up in the UK... I attended a Ukrainian school on Saturdays where I learned to read and write in Ukrainian. My first Ukraine game was... A Euro qualifier against France in Paris in March 1999. It was a 0-0 draw and it meant we finished second in the group, eventually losing a playoff against Slovenia over two legs. The mood is... Hopeful. I\u2019m resigned to the fact that Germany will top Group C, but the game against our neighbours Poland is the one I\u2019m looking forward to the most. It\u2019s a game that will likely decide who finishes as runners-up in the group so there\u2019s a lot riding on it. Marseille\u2019s Stade Velodrome is a stadium I can\u2019t wait to see and experience. I think starting against Germany is beneficial to us, as anything we pick up against them is a bonus. But we really need to beat Northern Ireland. Keep an eye out for... Our terrific duo Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Konoplyanka. On their day, they are as good as any attacking player in Europe. They have both carried the flag for Ukrainian football since the retirement of Andriy Shevchenko. Yarmolenko is the player Ukraine and Dynamo Kyiv will always turn to for something special. His loyalty to Dynamo was also highlighted this year, when he signed a new contract to ensure the club where his footballing education took place receives a transfer fee before an inevitable move away this summer. Ukraine has produced three Ballon d\u2019Or winners \u2013 Oleh Blokhin in 1975, Igor Belanov in 1986 and Shevchenko in 2004. If we were to produce another, it will surely be either Yarmolenko or Konoplyanka. Before the first game in Lille I\u2019ll be... On my bike. I\u2019m one of seven riders taking part in the Ride for Ukraine. Our aim is to raise money for those affected by the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine. We\u2019re riding 200 miles from London to Lille, in time for our first game against Germany on Sunday 12 June. Poland     Daniela Miernik.       Robert Lewandowski celebrates after scoring against Scotland. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images    Daniela Miernik was born in Warsaw and brought up in the Mazovian region.  Poland is... Fast-growing, vibrant, bang in the middle of Europe, with so many opportunities.  The mood is... One of excitement. We have a team that can leave their mark on the competition. Some bookies have gone as far as saying we\u2019re the dark horse of the championship. While that might be slightly optimistic, our national team has plenty of household names. Whatever European league you follow, I\u2019m pretty certain you have heard the names Lewandowski, Arkadiusz Milik, Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, Grzegorz Krychowiak and Kamil Grosicki. I\u2019m 100% sure Poland will get through to the quarter-finals at least. Will the team be parading the trophy down the streets of Warsaw after the 10 July final? Who knows. We are a hopeful and ambitious nation, and always aim as high as we can. Keep an eye out for... Sevilla midfielder Krychowiak. Having just won the Europa League, he should have a taste for success. He also uses his Instagram account to document his flamboyant clothes. No one can pull off wearing a Gucci coat and loafers like this guy. Brave dresser, great player: win-win. Spain     Jose Alberto Miras Franco.       Andr\u00e9s Iniesta in action during the recent 6-1 friendly win over South Korea. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock    Jose Alberto Miras Franco is from \u00c1guilas, a coastal village in the Murcia region. The mood is... Quietly confident. Spain is still a powerful team but it might not be as easy as in previous tournaments. We crashed down to earth during the World Cup in Brazil but we\u2019ve had time to consolidate. Germany and England have squads with higher potential than they\u2019ve had before. I\u2019d be happy with a semi-final place. Vicente del Bosque is... A brave man. Fernando Torres, Juan Mata and Diego Costa are high-profile players who did not make the squad. It\u2019s a bold decision by the coach and I hope it proves to be the right one. The game I\u2019m most looking forward to is... The first group game against Czech Republic in Toulouse. The first game will give us a lot of answers about how far we can go. We need to get off to a good start. On paper we should qualify from Group D but football is not always about quality. Our players need to have the right attitude. My favourite player is... Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. He\u2019s a synonym of respect, experience and quality. If Spain are to be successful again this summer, Iniesta will have a huge role to play. Croatia     Matej Sinlovca.    Matej Sinlovca is from Split, but is currently finishing a pharmacy degree at the University of East Anglia. My footballing hero is... Niko Kranjcar. I was just too young to see legend Davor Suker, so Kranjcar was the first name I printed on to a chequered shirt. I was proud to wear the No19 jersey wherever I went. The mood is...Nervous. On our day we can compete with the three other teams in the group. We almost shocked Spain in 2012 after all. Turkey and Czech Republic will both be fighting for the second spot, so there is little room for error. The most glaring squad omission is... Dejan Lovren. The defender fell out with head coach Ante Cacic before the tournament. It has left a gaping hole in our back four. Never mind, at least we have... Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic, possibly the best centre-midfield pairing in the world. Coupled with other stars such as Mario Mandzukic up front, Real Madrid\u2019s Mateo Kovacic, and the timeless Darijo Srna leading by example at the back, we have plenty of exciting players. We also boast a young squad bursting with potential \u2013 Ante Coric and Alen Halilovic will hopefully have their breakthroughs this summer. A successful tournament would be... Pushing Germany all the way in a quarter-final. To give the world champions a difficult game would make it an excellent tournament for Croatia. It would leave us with plenty of hope for the next World Cup in Russia. Turkey     Hakan Calhanoglu celebrates after scoring for Turkey against England. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images    Eser Karadag is a keen amateur footballer from Yesilkoy in Istanbul.  The mood is... Subdued. Because of political matters in Turkey, football is not a hot topic at the moment. I\u2019m proud of how we bounced back from some poor results early on in the qualifying group to win three in a row against Holland, Czech Republic and Iceland. We didn\u2019t concede one goal in those three games and ended up qualifying for Euro 2016 as the best third-placed team. Our recent games against Sweden and England have produced mixed results, but the performances show we can be competitive on our day. Turkey will... Get out of the group and reach the quarter-finals. Back in 2008, we had challenging games against both Croatia and Czech Republic, but we beat them both and I think we can get the better of them. Spain will win the group for sure.  My favourite player of all time is... Sergen Yalcin. I support Besiktas and the former midfielder was an important character for the club. He was extremely talented but, like a lot of Turkish players, his temperament wasn\u2019t always the best. Czech Republic     Will Petr Cech and Czech Republic have enough quality to get through the group stage? Photograph: David W Cerny/Reuters    Iain Sellars swapped Manchester for Prague over 20 years ago after falling in love with the Czech capital while on holiday.  The team close to my heart is... Slavia Prague. Having been the team for \u201cintellectuals\u201d during the communism years, Slavia were forced to change their name and leave their stadium. In the 1995-96 season they won the league for the first time since 1947 and also reached the semi-finals of the Uefa Cup. Unfortunately, Bordeaux were too strong over the two legs. That team contained players such as Karel Poborsky, Vladimir Smicer, Radek Bejbl and Jan Suchoparek who shone at Euro 96, when Czech Republic reached the final. The mood is... Cautious. We\u2019re aware of the current squad\u2019s limitations. Tomas Rosicky\u2019s apparent return to fitness is a cause for optimism but coach Pavel Vrba seems to be pinning all his hopes on our fragile captain. The group looks tough, but an early win will increase expectancy levels to fever pitch and the old town squares of the country\u2019s major cities will be awash with beer and sausage addled hordes watching on big screens. I wish we still had... Pavel Nedved. The national team still lacks someone that can take a game by the scruff of the neck when needed.  I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got rid of... Golden and silver goals. It was bad enough suffering a golden goal defeat at Euro 96 in the final to Germany, but the silver goal defeat to Greece in 2004 was even harder to stomach. That should\u2019ve been Czech Republic\u2019s year, having beaten Germany and Netherlands in the group stages before waltzing over Denmark in the quarter-finals. It was a cruel way to depart a tournament they had dominated. I\u2019d be happy to reach any kind of knock-out stage this time around! Keep an eye out for... Sparta Prague winger Borek Dockal is capable of causing opposition defenders problems. Ladislav Krejci is another young bright spark. We rely on these two to provide lone striker Tomas Necid with decent service, but he is struggling for from. He hasn\u2019t scored for his Turkish club Bursaspor for several months. We certainly miss the the psychical presence of Jan Koller and the speed of Milan Baros in the final third.  Italy     Federica D\u2019Andria.       Can Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon lead Italy from the back this summer? Photograph: Kerstin Joensson/AP    Federica D\u2019Andria is an Inter Milan fan who works for an advertising agency in Rome. The mood is... Negative. But this is usually the mood before every major tournament. We start off believing we\u2019ll be eliminated after losing all three group games, before thinking we\u2019ll win the whole thing after one impressive performance early on. There is no in-between. Head coach Antonio Conte is...Not loved by everyone. Having already agreed to manage Chelsea, many fear his thoughts are elsewhere. Juventus fans have stayed loyal to their ex-manager more than supporters of other clubs \u2013 they struggle to get behind him. If Conte wins the tournament, all will be forgotten of course, just like Marcello Lippi did in the 2006 World Cup. The Italy squad is missing... A wow factor. We don\u2019t have enough players in the squad who can make a difference. We particularly look a bit short in the final third. My favourite Italian player is... Gianluigi Buffon. He is a legend. Completely indestructible. If anyone can get this team going, it will be our leader at the back. Sweden     Sweden players celebrate a goal against Wales in their recent 3-0 friendly win. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters    Rickard Widegren is a Jonkopings Sodra fan living in southern Sweden. The mood is... Sceptical. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll do that well. We look quite weak overall. The 3-0 friendly win over Wales has lifted hopes a little, but I don\u2019t think we have the quality to beat either Italy or Belgium. We still rely too heavily on... Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He claimed to have sent the whole of Denmark into retirement after our playoff win which got us to France, but if he has an off-day in France, we have very few other stars in the making. Our other striker John Guidetti has Ibrahimovic\u2019s self belief but remains unproven on the big stage. We are weakest in... Midfield. We are in a transitional period and our midfield is particularly unproven. We are also missing our best defender in Oscar Wendt. The Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach left-back fails to see eye to eye with coach Erik Hamren. The best thing at Euro 2016 will be... Our fans. Watch out for that big yellow wall of noise. Ireland     Natalie McLaughlin.       Shane Long celebrates after scoring against Holland. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA    Natalie McLaughlin grew up in the village of Malin in County Donegal. The mood is... Through the roof! From the moment the hangovers began to subside on the morning of 16 November 2015 and the reality of what had just happened the previous night began to sink in, the excitement buzzometer has pretty much stayed there. What started off as a dream has suddenly developed into French flight times, the best landmarks to meet at and questions like: \u201cDo you thinks there\u2019s much chance of a ticket if I just land?\u201d With my feet still relatively close to the ground I think... We can reach the quarter-finals. But I consider myself to be a fairly optimistic person. If Sweden take the upper hand in the first game, we\u2019re pretty much done already. I\u2019m allowing myself to dream. The match I\u2019m looking forward to most is... Our last group game against Italy. Mostly for sentimental reasons. We have a long history together as fans and to most people over a certain age in Ireland the mere mention of Italia 90 is enough to crack a smile on even the most sceptical of sports fans. Their raw emotion coupled with our sheer willingness to celebrate almost anything is a recipe for a summer night to remember. My favourite player is... Shane Long. He scores important goals in important games and I\u2019m excited to see what he can produce during the tournament. My favourite player of all time is Paul McGrath. He was the Irish football hero of my generation \u2013 a great player and man. Belgium     Eden Renders.       Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne during training in May. Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP    Eden Renders is a builder from Itterbeek, a village near Brussels. The mood is... Cautious but optimistic. We have one of the best teams in the world, but we\u2019re famous for our \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d attitude. It\u2019s very unlike our neighbours the Dutch, whose self-confidence is always a source of hilarity for the quiet and modest Belgian. I\u2019ll miss them at this tournament. We\u2019ll progress through the group if... We keep the self-declared legend and genius Zlatan Ibrahimovic quiet when we play Sweden. We won\u2019t win against Italy. They are too experienced and smart. The Republic of Ireland will be a tough game too. I look forward to that one, they have great supporters. We can go far if... We have luck on our side. We\u2019re missing key defenders Vincent Kompany and Nicolas Lombaerts, so hopefully Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne will step up to the task. If they have good tournaments, then anything is possible. Portugal     Bruno Aguiar.       Cristiano Ronaldo talks to head coach Fernando Santos during a training session before Euro 2016. Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images    Bruno Aguiar is from Lisbon and works in the telecom industry.  Portuguese people are... Some of the warmest, friendliest and helpful human beings. Surprisingly modest too if all you know is Cristiano Ronaldo and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho! The mood is... One of reserved optimism. Clearly a lot depends on Ronaldo being fit, but if he\u2019s in the mood, Portugal have a great chance of building up momentum. The semi-finals are a realistic target. Anything less than a Group F win would be a huge disappointment. I have tickets for the knock-out rounds and it would be unbearable if Portugal were already on a plane home. Keep an eye out for... Our promising younger players. Portugal\u2019s coach Fernando Santos tends to stick with the experienced older heads but we have a lot of young players with great potential. If we have safely progressed to the knock-out stages after two games, then youth might get a chance. Only Austria could be a real threat in the group. Cristiano Ronaldo can only be matched by... Lu\u00eds Figo. He was my hero growing up. I\u2019m too young to have experienced the genius of Eus\u00e9bio. Austria     Anna.       David Alaba in action against Turkey during a recent friendly. Photograph: Hans Punz/AP    Anna lives in Vienna and works in IT.  Austria is... An amazing yet challenging place. The recent presidential election showed that rightwing opinions are yet again on the rise. Even though Vienna is a somewhat more moderate melting pot of different cultures and opinions, you can grasp the growing nationalism even here.  The mood is... One of excitement. The Panini stickers are everywhere and Vienna\u2019s outdoor restaurants are getting ready to put up their big screens. This summer is particularly interesting because... For the first time in ages Austria look like they might have a chance! I used to cry watching our international games because they were so bad. Usually people run around with shirts and flags of their favourite international teams, but this time there will be a lot of Austrian shirts and flags too. The game I\u2019m most looking forward to is... Our second group game against Portugal. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be able to get the better of Ronaldo, but I hope the Austrian boys will shine. The most important games will be against Iceland and Hungary. Hopefully we\u2019ll win them both and progress to the knock-out stages. My favourite Austria player is... David Alaba. He\u2019s a great player and a local hero. A lot of the team\u2019s success or failure this summer will be down to him. No pressure! Iceland     Eggert Stefansson.       Gylfi Sigurdsson has a big role to play for Iceland. Photograph: Filip Horvat/AP    Eggert Stefansson is from Reykjavik. Growing up in Iceland was... Wonderful. I grew up in the Reykjavik suburb of Breioholt, which was a new area that didn\u2019t have any real infrastructure in place to practice sports in the 1980s. There were plenty of building sites to get injured on though. My brother and I started playing football in the summer and handball in the winter for our local team Vikingur. This is a very Icelandic thing to do. Sending kids outside to play football in December is harsh. Iceland is... Spacious. Most of us are huddled together in the south-west corner of the country. This makes it possible to get a bit of an urban feel without losing the village vibe. The mood is... Slightly surreal. We\u2019re still in a state of shock that our boys have qualified for a major tournament for the first time. We almost made it to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup, but lacked the experience and composure to beat Croatia over two legs. Of course our women\u2019s team qualified for the Uefa Women\u2019s Euro 2009 competition, but their achievement attracted a lot less media attention. Our qualifying campaign was... Incredible. Beating the Dutch home and away was an amazing achievement. Prospects of getting through to the knock-out stages are... Slim. But the team has already exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations. The Hungary game is probably our best chance of getting a result, but our head-to-head record against them is not great. Hopefully we\u2019ll not resort to parking the bus and playing long balls just to try and progress through the group stage. Positive, attacking football got us this far, so I hope we keep it up. I will be ecstatic if we score a goal. It doesn\u2019t have to be a good goal. I\u2019ll even go crazy if it\u2019s an own goal. Keep an eye out for...T he vision and technique of Gylfi Sigurdsson, the brute force of Aron Gunnarsson (PLEASE don\u2019t get sent off), the pace of Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, and the composure and experience of Eidur Gudjohnsen.

Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters    Lenard Lajtos is a 19-year-old student from Budapest.  The mood is... Very excited. I\u2019m traveling to the Stade V\u00e9lodrome stadium in Marseille for our second group match against Iceland and am counting down the days. This is the strongest Hungarian team in over a decade. We have no real position in the starting XI that lacks the required quality. The whole country is behind them. I also never thought I\u2019d see legendary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly showing off his grey sweatpants at a major tournament. Our best chance of a win is against... Iceland. We are underdogs but should be able to get at least a point. We\u2019ve beaten all the other Nordic countries in recent years, so Iceland is the last one to tick off the list.  Keep an eye out for... Nemanja Nikolic. He was the top scorer in the Polish Ekstraklasa with Legia Warsaw. Balazs Dzsudzsak still has an amazing left foot, while the experienced midfielder Zoltan Gera will hopefully inspire and guide the young duo Adam Nagy and Laszlo Kleinheisler.", "title": "Fans from all 24 countries share their hopes and expectations for Euro 2016", "sentences": ["I\u2019m just moving back to the UK after several years in Dubai and I\u2019ve missed the valleys and forests of home so much."], "publicationDate": "2016-06-09T10:46:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/09/nick-jonas-last-year-was-complicated-review-single-sad-and-highly-sexed-pop", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Single, sad and highly sexed, Nick Jonas wrote his third solo album in the wake of a breakup and the dawn of his dating exploration.

The Jetmen of Dubai, a couple of fearless Frenchmen who strap delta-wing jetpacks to their backs, turning themselves into miniature planes, then fly in formation over the Arabian desert. It\u2019s about as near as you can get to being Peter Pan. How do they land, I wonder? [Checks the internet \u2013 oh, like that.] Once you\u2019ve found the Jetmen on the internet, it\u2019s hard to get away, and you\u2019ll soon find you\u2019ve lost half an hour. Love the stunt with the big Airbus A380. This is City in the Sky (BBC2, Sunday), and it\u2019s not just about French daredevils, it\u2019s about all things aviation. In this second episode we\u2019ve taken off, we are up there, and Dallas Campbell and Hannah Fry are looking at how the hell we stay up there. Yves and Vince, human fuselages with their strap-on wings, are here to demonstrate lift. (And to be cool. \u201cYou can play with clouds,\u201d says Yves, romantically). But there\u2019s more to it than just physics; there are other important questions for science broadcaster Dallas and mathematician Hannah to look into. Such as: how does the pilot know which way to go? How do we avoid bumping into the other million or so people up there at any one time? What happens if the plane gets struck by lightning? Or if you\u2019re struck down by a stroke? Why do stallions go at the front, and mares at the back, if it\u2019s a flight for horses, not people? And do they \u2013 the horses \u2013 get jet lag? The answers, respectively? The pilots follow waypoints, digital breadcrumbs in the sky (\u201cMore or less yes, like Hansel and Gretel,\u201d says the nice Luftansa pilot, flying his A380 from Frankfurt to Delhi). And they follow invisible highways, with loads of rules about how far they have to stay away from each other, rules that can presumably be waived for delta-winged Frenchmen. The lightning strike? Pretty common, as it happens and not too serious, thanks to something called the Faraday Effect, which I vaguely remember from school. It gets a bit more complicated in a new carbon composite plane, which has to have copper mesh woven into it to disperse the charge. But basically you\u2019re OK. A stroke, or any other serious medical problem you might have during the flight? Dr Doug Ross will see you now. Not the real Dr Ross (who is fictional anyway), but an ER doc who does look a bit like George Clooney and who works from a room in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, advising cabin crews all over the world as they deal with passengers in trouble. (\u201cIs he breathing on his own, over?\u201d). Kind of ER by proxy, then. So in fact, Dr Ross never actually sees any of his patients \u2013 or even finds out if they make it. What\u2019s the point in having a handsome doc if you never get to see him? And now to the really interesting part, the horses. Dallas is following a Belgian stallion called Chardonnay \u2013 is that fair, calling a male horse Chardonnay? \u2013 who is flying with 63 other thoroughbreds from Liege to Hong Kong for a showjumping event. And Chardonnay and the other stallions go at the front. \u201cYou don\u2019t want stallions behind mares\u201d explains the vet. \u201cIf the mare is thinking about coming in season, stallions are designed to react to that, and they will react to that.\u201d Yes, I can see that a 64-horse orgy could make for a bumpy ride \u2013 almost as bad, I imagine, as having Kate Moss, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Naomi Campbell and the England Supporters Club all in the back of your plane. And does Chardonnay get jet lag? Yes, though he\u2019s not very good at talking about it, so it\u2019s hard to know how it compares. If Chardonnay was flying in a carbon composite plane like a Boeing Dreamliner he would be less likely to suffer because they can withstand higher internal pressure meaning more oxygen for the passengers, human or equine. See, it\u2019s interesting. And you thought you knew pretty much everything there was to know about the business of going from A to B in an aeroplane. Who would have thought there could be a fascinating, fresh, three-part documentary in it? But Dallas and Hannah have dug one out, clocking up a fair few airmiles, and text messages to each other, in the process. They\u2019re good, just the right mix of fan and geek, wow and this-is-how.

The allegations came at the start of a legal claim by the Libyan Investment Authority for $1.2bn (\u00a3846m) from the investment bank. Lawyers for the LIA are claiming for losses on nine trades that Goldman Sachs executed for the fund between January and April 2008. The LIA lost almost all its investment through the trades \u2013 one of which was the largest that the bank had undertaken in a single stock \u2013 while Goldman Sachs generated \u201ceyewatering\u201d profits of over more than $200m from the trades, Roger Masefield, a QC for LIA, said. The LIA, Masefield told the court, felt betrayed as the trades generated excessive profits for Goldman and were unsuitable for the LIA, which was staffed by individuals who had not been appointed on merit. Once the losses emerged, Masefield said one Libyan official described Goldman as the \u201cbank of mafiosa\u201d. The LIA was set up in 2006 to invest the country\u2019s oil wealth as its status from a pariah state was being lifted. Masefield said it was a nascent sovereign wealth fund with limited abilities to understand the so-called jumbo and elephant trades.  Goldman is disputing the claim, which was filed in 2014, and its lawyers will address the court on Tuesday. But in documents outlining its defence the bank said that the proceedings were not brought until after the trades had matured. \u201cThe LIA was the victim of an unforeseen financial depression, not of any wrongdoing by [Goldman],\u201d the bank said. In documents provided to the court, the LIA cited Goldman Sachs describing the sovereign wealth fund as having \u201czero-level\u201d financial sophistication and one individual having \u201cdelivered a pitch on structured leveraged loans to someone who lives in the middle of the desert with his camels\u201d. Masefield told the court that one former Goldman executive \u2013 Youseff Kabbaj \u2013 had been told to \u201cstay a lot in Tripoli. It is important you stay super close to clients on a daily basis. Teach them, train them, dine them.\u201d  Goldman agreed an internship for Haitem Zarti, the brother of Mustafa Zarti, the LIA\u2019s former deputy chief, which the LIA argues was intended to influence decisions by the investment fund.  According to the skeleton argument presented to the court by the LIA: \u201cMr Kabbaj took Haitem Zarti on holidays to Morocco on various occasions. Mr Kabbaj also took him to Dubai for a conference, with the business class flights and five-star accommodation being paid by Goldman Sachs. Documents disclosed by Goldman Sachs show that during that drip Mr Kabbaj went so far as to arrange for a pair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening.\u201d  The LIA said the internship \u201chas been and may still be the subject of investigation\u201d by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. Goldman Sachs said it did not believe the internship influenced the LIA\u2019s decision to enter into the trades. \u201cThe claims are without merit and we will continue to defend them vigorously,\u201d it said.  Kabbaj - who claimed \u00a322,000 for one trip - was not being called to give evidence for Goldman, Masefield said, reading out a settlement agreement between the bank and Kabbaj, who had been promised a $9m bonus by Goldman, but received $4.5m. The aim, Masefield argued, was intended to stop Kabbaj\u2019s concerns about the trades being aired.  Bloomberg quoted an email from Kabbaj in which he said: \u201cGoldman Sachs or myself never paid for any LIA employee any improper entertainment...I am under a strong confidentiality agreement but I expect Goldman Sachs to correct the facts and protect my reputation\u201d. Masefield told the court that Driss Ben-Brahim \u2013 at the time a Goldman Sachs partner \u2013 in July 2007 met the LIA\u2019s Zarti on Saif Gaddafi\u2019s yacht in Cannes. Ben-Brahim wrote after the meeting that he was nervous about the relationship and wanted clearance from a more senior banker. Later, according to court documents, Goldman executives spent \u20ac25,800 \u2013 including contributions from their own pockets \u2013 to charter a private jet from the same company that Colonel Gaddafi used to travel to Tripoli. Nine trades \u2013 on banking companies Citigroup, Santander and UniCredit, French electricity company EDF, utility ENI and German insurer Allianz \u2013 are the subject of the case.  The LIA argued that the case was one of of \u201cabuse of trust, undue influence and unconscionable bargain\u201d.  It added: \u201cIt most emphatically is not, therefore, as Goldman Sachs would have it, one of little more than \u2018buyer\u2019s remorse\u2019; of a counterparty who like many others lost money as a result of the market crash in 2008 and now wants to rewind the clock.\u201d The case continues.", "title": "Goldman Sachs hired prostitutes to win Libyan business, court told", "sentences": ["Mr Kabbaj also took him to Dubai for a conference, with the business class flights and five-star accommodation being paid by Goldman Sachs."], "publicationDate": "2016-06-13T12:51:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/14/royal-ascot-2016-horse-by-horse-guide-prince-of-wales-stakes", "tags": ["Royal Ascot 2016", "Royal Ascot", "Sport", "Horse racing"], "article": "A Shin Hikari Japanese raider is a prolific winner, including in \u00a31.1m Hong Kong Cup in December.

Deservedly the hot favourite in this small field, though a second such performance cannot be taken for granted after travelling around the world.

Well held by A Shin Hikari at Chantilly last time, beaten 14 lengths into fifth, but got no run that day, being held in at the rear by a rival as the race developed after the turn for home. Stayed on quite strongly when it was too late. A better showing is perfectly possible in this smaller field. The Grey Gatsby Shockingly unlucky in this race last year when repeatedly denied a clear run in the straight, finally bursting forward when granted some space to be beaten a short-head. But that was on a fast surface, like the one he had when beating a Derby winner in the Irish Champion almost two years ago. Has usually run well below his best on a softer surface and ground may be his undoing here. Making his seasonal reappearance, having needed a few runs to reach his peak in the past two seasons.

I still remember when my hometown was liberated and Mother and I walked on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. I always wished to visit America but my father, who was very strict, was against it. At the time, I had a full-time job in an international music publishing company off the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, translating English lyrics to French. This gave me the opportunity to meet artists such as Edith Piaf. Even though it was a glamorous job, I still longed for travel and adventure (and to get away from my strict father). Armenian friends in Los Angeles agreed to sponsor me, and within one month I had obtained a visa and, later, a green card. In Paris, I had bought a Greyhound package giving me unlimited travel for three months. I travelled to 30 US states before settling in San Francisco in the fall of 1961. I was excited to go and listen to jazz in San Francisco. I found a job downtown, making less there than I had in Paris. Still, I loved the work and the people there. I also did some hair modelling for Clairol. People who heard my French accent asked: \u201cDid you come with one of our GIs?\u201d I was pleased to tell them no, I had come alone, using my own money.  In June 1967, I was married. On our honeymoon, we attended the Monterey International Pop Festival. My husband knew Janis Joplin and members of the Big Brother and Holding Company, who they were performing there. After the summer of 1967, the San Francisco mood began to change and by 1969 many of our friends were leaving, some on a bus to Tennessee to start a commune.

In 1972 he obtained a master\u2019s degree in environmental planning from the University of Pennsylvania. The then Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter, offered him a position in his natural resources department and we moved to Georgia. We had a second daughter, and I worked at several jobs, mostly as a translator, to have funds for regular trips to Paris. In 1982, a large corporation, Lockheed Martin, offered me a position. About 60 Algerian air force trainees had come to learn English and C-130 aircraft maintenance. As a customer liaison officer, I spoke French with them. I was like their big sister, taking them to doctors, making sure their stay in America went smoothly. Over time, we had trainees from Kuwait, Egypt, Dubai, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, China, Ethiopia, etc. Some stayed a week and others stayed a couple of years.  It was another glamorous job, but it was demanding since I needed to be on call 24/7 in case of an emergency (and there were several!). I wrote reports on the trainees\u2019 countries so my colleagues at Lockheed would be familiar with their culture. I also took the trainees on little trips and explained American culture.  After 26 years in my company, I decided to retire knowing that I would miss the international connections. During those 26 years, I had traveled, paying my own way to many of my trainees\u2019 cities, such as Addis Ababa, Dubai, Algiers, Tunis, Singapore, Dakar, Pisa, Bangkok, Jakarta, Libreville (Gabon) and more.

Further detail of the alleged involvement of sex workers in winning business for the investment bank \u2013 one of the prostitutes was said to be called Michella \u2013 was revealed on the second day of a case in which the Libyan Investment Authority is claiming $1.2bn (\u00a3847m) from Goldman Sachs over nine loss-making trades that took place between January and April 2008. Goldman is defending the case, which was first tabled in 2014, and argues that the LIA lost out on its nine trades because of \u201cunforeseen financial depression, not of any wrongdoing\u201d by the bank. The particulars of the prostitutes had been recovered from the BlackBerry of a Goldman banker, Youseff Kabbaj, whom the court had been told on Monday was a key contact with the LIA. Roger Masefield, QC for the LIA, told the court he would not read out the \u201csalacious\u201d detail in the text exchanges, in which he tries to haggle down the price and asks her to bring along an equally good-looking friend . The allegation is that the services of the sex workers were bought by Kabbaj as he attempted to get closer to Haitem Zarti, the brother of a senior official at the LIA. Masefield said Kabbaj was forming links with Zarti to win business for Goldman from the LIA. The court had been told on Monday that Goldman had agreed a paid internship for Zarti, which Masefield said was intended to influence decisions by the investment fund. Goldman said this is not the case. Robert Miles, QC for Goldman, addressing Mrs Justice Rose for the first time, said: \u201cWe say that this truly is a case of buyers\u2019 remorse.\u201d The LIA had expected to make large profits on the nine trades on companies such as electricity company EDF and US bank Citigroup. But, Miles said:\u201cThe underlying stocks tanked. What it [the LIA] seeks to do with this claim is to get its money back for an investment which turned out badly for it\u201d. Miles also said that contrary to the arguments being put forward by the LIA, officials at the fund had been shown the complexity of the transactions in which they were getting involved and had selected the companies in which they wanted exposure. He began setting out Goldman\u2019s defence after the court was shown the texts about the prostitute, which Masefield said were in the recovery file on Kabbaj\u2019s BlackBerry, and sent on 24 February 2008 when he and Zarti were in Dubai. Kabbaj is not being called to give evidence, the court has been told, because of a settlement agreement with the bank over a $4.5m bonus in 2008. Masefield said the text messages showed that Kabbaj had also forwarded the details of the prostitute to Zarti later. Zarti had replied he was \u201cgetting back to God\u2019s way and it was too late and he wanted to sleep,\u201d Masefield said. The prostitutes were hired after Kabbaj and Zarti had flown into Dubai from Morocco to attend a conference, according to Masefield. \u201cHaitem Zarti\u2019s business-class flights to Dubai were paid for by Goldman Sachs, as was his accommodation in the five-star Ritz Carlton.\u201d Even though Zarti was not an LIA official, he had been showered with corporate hospitality, Masefield said. Masefield told the court the profits being made by Goldman on the trades with the LIA were so large that Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of the firm, had raised questions on 27 April 2008 while on a trip to Abu Dhabi.  One Goldman executive emailed another: \u201cArm us my friend with the details so we can get back to Lloyd. We are seeing him again at 9am. Keep this email to yourself\u201d.

This step up in distance ought to help him, given that he has so often finished strongly. Closely matched with a few of these. Finished a length behind Flying Officer here in October and although he edged that one out for second in the Sagaro here in April, the other horse is 5lb better in at the weights now. Beat Curbyourenthusiasm half a length in the Yorkshire Cup last time, wearing cheekpieces (retained here) for the first time.   Related: Graham Lee wins the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot on Trip To Paris    Curbyourenthusiasm Progressive handicapper who did well to run Clever Cookie to half a length on his Group debut last month, especially since that rival had a fitness advantage. Tends to start slowly, which will make life difficult for him in this big field with only a short home straight. Might be better suited by a drier surface. Flying Officer Unbeaten in three starts last year, when he made up into a classy stayer, ending the year with victory here on Champions Day, holding off Clever Cookie by a length. Only third in the Sagaro on his reappearance but was conceding 5lb to Mizzou and Clever Cookie, while he meets them on level terms here with just three parts of a length to make up. Should be sharper for that run. Extra half-mile poses a question but he is versatile as to ground and should be able to race handily, which is probably the right tactic here. Fun Mac Makes his reappearance, which has been the time to catch him for the past two years. However, the best of those wins was in a handicap off 84 and this is several leagues above that. Showed some ability in Group races last autumn and was a close second in a handicap over this course and distance at the last Royal meeting but needs to take a big step forward. Griraz Ex-French 11-year-old has yet to show the necessary level of form in 78 races, though he was able to win three times in Listed company at a mile and a half in 2012 and 2013. More recent runs have been at a lesser level. Makes his debut for sharp trainer David Pipe and, perhaps tellingly, for windmill-tilting owner Fergus Wilson. On offer at 250-1 and still not tempting. Max Dynamite Ex-hurdler, second in the Galway Hurdle last summer, has made up into an excellent stayer, beating Mizzou and Clever Cookie by daylight at York in August and beaten just half a length in the Melbourne Cup after trouble in running. Only third of four at odds-on when he reappeared at Sandown last month but may have been in need of the outing and could be a lot sharper this time. Ground should be fine and we may not have seen the best of him. Mille Et Mille Fair handicapper and Listed winner sprang a big surprise when landing a top-class staying race at Longchamp in October, thanks to an enterprising ride from the front. That did not seem a strong race and the fancied horses flopped, so he still looks a rung or two below this level unless his jockey is somehow able to pull off a similar trick. Well beaten under a hold-up ride on his reappearance. Mizzou Good-quality stayer who won the Sagaro here for the second time in April, pipping Clever Cookie and Flying Officer. Failed to build on last year\u2019s win when only seventh in this race, looking one-paced even for a stayer. This slower surface will help and a repeat of the more forward tactics used last time could also make a difference. Four lengths to make up on Max Dynamite from August. Pallasator Quirky but talented, he can boil over in the preliminaries and that must be a concern in this atmosphere, though he was calmer on his reappearance. Bulk of his form suggests he has a bit to find and only fourth behind Flying Officer here in October, albeit after a troubled run. Reappearance success came against just three rivals, with the favourite failing to show his worth. Scotland Easy to dismiss, since his only success was in a low-value contest three years ago, but that could be a mistake. Unexposed at this sort of distance and ran on into sixth in this race last year. Could do better again with this soft ground making it still more of a test. Did at least as well as could be expected when beaten just a head in a much shorter contest on his reappearance here last month. Wears a hood for the first time. Sheikhzayedroad Consistent performer at a slightly lower level and managed to find a winnable Grade One in Canada in 2014. Unexposed at staying distances and interesting to see him win easily at a mile and three-quarters in Dubai this spring. No disgrace to be well held in a much stronger, shorter race there when last seen. Wouldn\u2019t like to see him dropped out at the back of such a big field but those tactics are quite likely with his stamina still open to question. Versatile as to ground but probably best on a faster surface. Suegioo Winless since Chester Cup of 2014, which was only his second success and rather handed to him by the wayward antics of a rival. Has often run with credit in Group company but has been repeatedly beaten by rivals like Pallasator, Flying Officer, Mizzou and Clever Cookie. Burmese Improving handicapper at the end of last year and did well when tried in Group company in the Sagaro, ploughing on for a fair fifth after trouble in running. Done for speed when last seen but this will suit him better. Still likely to find a few too strong at this early stage of his career. Order Of St George The hot favourite from the Aidan O\u2019Brien yard that has won this six times in the past 10 years. Nicely bred and became an obvious contender for this when landing the Irish Leger by 11 lengths in September. Those behind have done little for the form since then but that may not matter. Made a pleasing reappearance on ground that was probably too quick when winning at Leopardstown a fortnight ago. Has been held up at the back for his last two starts and such tactics could leave him vulnerable if the pace were steady. Otherwise, deserves his well-fancied status. The Twisler Hit form last August, winning twice including a Listed race at Goodwood, which, interestingly, was his first attempt on soft. Has failed to show that level of form in his last three starts and this is asking an awful lot, even allowing for a return to his best. Silvestre de Sousa rides for the first time and should help maximise what chance he has. Tiberian French raider won twice at a low level last year but is winless since moving into Pattern company. Looked a stayer when tried at two miles last year, so may be able to do better than the modest form he has shown at shorter trips recently. Requires a huge leap of faith. Wasir Stunned better-fancied stablemate when making all in German Group Three last month, easily his biggest success so far. This race is unlikely to unfold so kindly for him and the much softer surface will probably not suit. Kicky Blue Kept on for second at 50-1 behind Mille Et Mille in French Group One last autumn, when it paid to race handily. Winless run has endured for two years.

The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) argues that Goldman and its bankers attempted to exert influence over its investment decisions by paying hotel bills and offering corporate hospitality.  Robert Miles QC told Mrs Justice Rose that corporate hospitality was \u201cpart of the ordinary influences of commercial life\u201d. He said the corporate hospitality Goldman is said to offered \u2013 tickets to the Rugby World Cup and Champions League finals \u2013 were not lavish in comparison to what other banks were offering the LIA. He read out an email in which an LIA official asked HSBC to provide hotel accommodation. The LIA has also made claims that a Goldman banker, Youseff Kabbaj, procured prostitutes as part of his efforts to win access to the fund. Goldman\u2019s QC did not address these allegations. Kabbaj, the court has been told, has agreed a $4.5m settlement with Goldman and will not give evidence.  Miles said it would be a travesty to say that Goldman had misled the LIA, which argues that its staff did not understand the detail of the loss-making trades that took place between January and April 2008, and which are at the centre of the claim.  \u201cThe question is what they were capable of understanding and what they did understand. If it turns out they didn\u2019t understand it\u2019s not through any fault of [Goldman],\u201d he said.  He also disputed the idea that Kabbaj was able to exert influence at the LIA, which had dealings with 77 financial institutions and had refused to take part in one deal involving the head office of the Spanish bank Santander. \u201cThis idea he had them under his thumb will not wash,\u201d Miles said.  The case is expected to last seven weeks and the first witnesses are due to be called on Thursday. The court was told that Sofia Blount, nee Wellesley, the wife of the pop singer James Blunt and who used to work as a PA at the LIA, would not give evidence. Roger Masefield QC, representing the LIA, told the court she was not being called because of \u201cmedia intrusion\u201d.

Documents disclosed by Goldman Sachs show that during that trip Mr Kabbaj went so far as to arrange for a pair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening,\u201d the LIA said.

Making her reappearance, she pulled off a wildly improbably success at Lingfield last month, failing to handle the track and dropping to last off the home turn before rocketing past all her rivals. Needs drying conditions because soft ground is a doubt for her and horses with that kind of speed rarely prosper on a soft surface. Stamina for this mile also in question but there\u2019s a good race in her when things fall right. Besharah One of last year\u2019s best juvenile fillies, winning a Group Three here on soft going as well as York\u2019s Lowther. Still has good races in her, to judge by her close fourth in the French Guineas last month, but her finishing effort was not strong and her stamina for a mile on a testing surface must be in doubt. Czabo Stamina not in question with this one, who might benefit from another couple of furlongs. Was a fair fourth in the Irish Guineas, but that leaves her 12 lengths to make up on Jet Setting. Better again when landing a Listed prize at Deauville a fortnight ago. Interesting outsider if there\u2019s enough rain to keep the going soft. Fireglow Won twice at Listed level last year and has trained on enough to be fourth in the Guineas (a neck behind Alice Springs) and second in the Musidora, just ahead of a horse that was then third in the Oaks. Step back in trip is not obviously a positive and it looks as though she is just below this class. Versatile as to ground. Jet Setting Confirmed mudlark whose first two wins came on heavy going and indeed her third was probably also on heavy if the truth were known. That was in the Irish 1,000 Guineas last month when she became the first horse since August to beat Minding, winner of the English Guineas, with Czabo 12 lengths back in fourth. Could use every drop of rain that falls. Big chance on soft going but at risk of being outpaced if the ground dries up. Layout of this track, with a short home straight, may not suit her battling style so well as other tracks have. Sold at auction for \u00a31.3m on Monday. Marenko Only win last year was in a maiden, though she went close in a Group Two and a Group Three before looking outclassed in the Fillies Mile. Unbeaten in two this year, with Besharah back in third in a Group Three at Chelmsford last time. Appears to have grown into herself and probably better to come but this requires a lot more. Versatile as to ground. Nathra Only defeat in her first four starts was when second to the mighty Minding in the Fillies Mile in October. Seems to appreciate some cut and limitations arguably exposed on a drier surface when fifth in the Guineas. Has since been a useful running-on second in the French Guineas and may do better here with more juice in the ground. The trainer John Gosden having a good week. Nemoralia Bundles of ability and would be a confident selection if this race were run on sun-baked fast going. Soft going, however, is new to her and the suspicion is that she may struggle to cope. Ran on to be third at the Breeders\u2019 Cup last year, just a head behind Alice Springs, who had a better run through the race. Rocketed home six lengths clear in a Listed race at York on her reappearance, Czabo trailing her by 12 lengths. An exciting prospect, whatever happens here. Now Or Never Looked useful in victory at Leopardstown in May when the going was good but regressed in the Irish Guineas next time, toiling home 10 lengths behind Jet Setting, two lengths ahead of Czabo. That was her second defeat behind Jet Setting in soggy conditions this year and perhaps she has had enough of that kind of surface. If so, she needs an unexpected turn in the weather here. Promising Run Group Two winner as a juvenile but has 12 lengths to make up on Nathra from their Fillies Mile form in October. Two fair efforts in Dubai to start the year and she was then third, a head behind Fireglow, in the Musidora. Lots to prove at this level and the ground is unlikely to help. Qemah From the French yard that won this race last year. Third in a Group One as a juvenile and again in the French Guineas last time, sandwiched between Nathra and Besharah. Best effort when winning a Group Three at Chantilly in April and probably no coincidence that that has been her only taste of soft going so far. Chance to get involved if the ground stays wet. Tanaza Two wins in June and July last year, beating Alice Springs in a Group Three on the latter occasion. Beaten by that rival and others when fourth in a Group One in September. Went well for a fair way on her reappearance in the Irish Guineas and may be sharper for the outing after fading into seventh, 14 lengths behind Jet Setting.

Bouchet\u2019s work, as any Freudian could tell you, must have something to do with money. Titled \u201cWhat People Do For Money \u2013 Some Joint Ventures\u201d, and devised by the biennial\u2019s guest curator, multimedia artist Christian Jankowski, the latest incarnation of Manifesta involves collaborations between artists and more than 30 professions in the city. The previous two editions \u2013 in St Petersburg and a former mining town in Belgium \u2013 both dealt with the social situations of their respective venues.

Maurizio Cattelan, who had announced he was giving up art on the eve of his Guggenheim Museum retrospective in 2012, has been working with wheelchair racer Edith Wolf-Hunkeler. If Jesus could walk on water, why not an athlete in a wheelchair? The Paralympic champion glided, or perhaps churned, across Lake Zurich, her wheelchair mounted on a raft powered by the wheels of the chair itself \u2013 but after I left Zurich. Some things work just as well as rumour.  I did visit Belgian artist Guillaume Bijl\u2019s fully functioning dog grooming parlour, Hundesalon Bobby, where local mutts can get the latest in canine coiffure from dog stylist Jacqueline Meier. I can\u2019t speak of the artistry of the doggy hairdos, but the kitschy, tongue-in-cheek parlour is amusing enough. Normally this place is part of a commercial gallery. If only others diversified so usefully.     Tom Emerson\u2019s Pavillon of Reflections floats on its pontoon in Lake Zurich. Photograph: Ennio Leanza/EPA    As well as the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukunst and the Helmhaus museum, Manifesta 11 takes us to more than 30 outlying venues and collaborations around the city, including a cemetery, a public hospital, a school, a tourist office, a Swiss clockmaker\u2019s shop, and out on to a floating Pavilion of Reflection on the lake. Designed and built by the studio of London and Zurich-based architect Tom Emerson, the skeletal wooden structure doubles as outdoor cinema and swimming pool, complete with changing rooms, lockers and hairdryers. It\u2019s like a spa, but with ashtrays, a barbecue and a bar, the perfect place to get Bouchet out of my system. Is Michel Houellebecq OK, readers of the troubling French novelist often ask. Well, Houellebecq has checked himself in to one of Zurich\u2019s leading private clinics \u2013 so upscale the row of clocks behind the main desk are set to the time-zones in Dubai and Stellenbosch, South Africa as well as Switzerland \u2013 and had a bunch of scans and blood tests. His charts are printed up in great piles for visitors to take away, though you have to edge round anxious patients in the lobby to get at them. I can\u2019t make head nor tail of the novelist\u2019s haemoglobin levels. Nor does he offer us copies of the bill for his check-up, probably a heart-attack inducing sum.

Probably, yes'    Back at the Helmhaus, disturbing scans of Houellebecq\u2019s head are on display. There\u2019s the skull beneath the skin, and some squirmy stuff that looks as if parasitic worms have invaded his brain. They probably write his books. On my visit, artist Santiago Sierra, who has also worked in the past with human excrement, had just begun barricading the entrance to the Helmhaus with the help of a local security consultant, who advised the artist how best to ensure the building would be safe from any possible car bombs, snipers and other attacks. Sandbags were on the way, but no razor-wire as yet uncoiled. Everywhere is a war zone now, Sierra is saying. Next stop, the dentist. To tell the truth I ran away from the surgery, having already seen enough of Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8dland\u2019s graphic photographs of open mouths and dental procedures in the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukunst. There are even pictures of teeth embedded in sugary foodstuffs, grinning through the patisserie. There\u2019s more photos in the waiting room.     Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8dland, Intraoral no. 2. Photograph: Wolfgang Traeger/Manifesta11    Unfolding through both the Helmhaus and L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukunst, a parallel \u201cHistorical Exhibition\u201d, curated by Francesca Gavin, is a trove of photographs, paintings, sculpture and conceptual works organised by theme, paralleling Jankowski\u2019s \u201ccollaborative ventures\u201d. Very often it upstages the new commissions. In the section Break Hour is an installation of Duane Hanson\u2019s 1989 Lunchbreak, a group of life-sized, lifelike construction workers, lounging, smoking, staring blankly, hanging around. That\u2019s builders for you. In Portraits of Professions, August Sander\u2019s photographs of labourers and singers, artists and seamen, sit next to the film of astronaut Chris Hadfield singing David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity while orbiting in the International Space Station. This is fun, and though Hadfield has released an album, his artistic career has probably peaked. In Professions in the Art World, I came across oversized hollow papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads of curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist and New York art critics Roberta Smith and Jerry Saltz. The cartoonish heads grin knowingly. But what do they know? I feel like snatching one up and inserting my own head, to get some inside knowledge.         Astronaut Chris Hadfield performs Space Oddity in the International Space Station    At once playful and serious, and providing both context and counterpoint, Gavin\u2019s show rambles through both main venues, with dozens of historical and recent works arranged on freestanding open structures that sidle through the galleries. Without it, much of the current Manifesta would look a bit thin. But there are high-points, including the riotous, scrabbly drawings that cover a huge wall in the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukunst, the result of a collaboration between Andrea \u00c9va Gy\u00f6ri, a \u201csexpert\u201d and a psychologist in clinical sexology.  Gy\u00f6ri\u2019s drawings are a bacchanalia of masturbating women and explosive fantasies, a ribald affirmation of female sexuality. Nearby, there is a vicious gouge in the wall. It looks like an injury, and was made by Sonja Victoria Vera Bohorquez, a Zurich-based transgender prostitute. Bohorquez is working with Mexican artist Teresa Margolles, who last month organised and filmed a poker game in a hotel basement in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, with a group of transsexual sex workers. We watch them discuss their dangerous lives, and the unsolved murder of their friend and colleague Karlita in the city in December last year. Margolles has also organised a further Poker de Damas, including Bohorquez, in a Zurich hotel, where Manifesta visitors to ask questions and chat. An insight into other lives, Margolles\u2019 project is one of the best, and toughest, here.  Over at Cabaret Voltaire, original home of the Dada movement, there is an open call for anyone to submit performance proposals. \u201cA performance could consist of an artist kissing a clown or a real estate agent selling an artist\u2019s studio,\u201d suggest Jankowski and the cabaret\u2019s guildmaster. One artist has already proposed a collaboration with a contract killer, while Viennese performance group Gelitin have provided a drawing of the performance group engaging with various professions, including an alien, in a Sadean coprophagic orgy.

What little grows here is largely cultivated in air-conditioned greenhouses. So depleted is the local aquifer that it\u2019s forecast to run completely dry within the next half-century. But if the scientists and agronomists at the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA) get it right, the Gulf\u2019s glitzy commercial hub may soon be responsible for one of the most significant regional food innovations in recent memory. As the Middle East\u2019s groundwater stores have ebbed, and the mercury has soared, staple crops such as wheat, barley and rice have suffered in the increasingly hostile conditions. Desperate to maintain agricultural yields at a time when populations are also booming, some experts have come to wonder: might quinoa, the hardy, much-vaunted \u201csuper food\u201d of the Andes, offer a solution? \u201cIt can deal with high salinity, very little water and is seen as a climate change-resistant crop,\u201d said ICBA\u2019s Kameswara Nanduri Rao at his organisation\u2019s neatly landscaped centre, which sits amid the semi-arid scrubland on Dubai\u2019s outskirts. \u201cBecause of all these problems, people are looking at it as the crop of the future.\u201d Quinoa and the mostly low-lying terrain of the UAE make strange bedfellows. But several years of encouraging test trials \u2013 many conducted on two Emirati farms abandoned due to high groundwater salinity \u2013 have softened scepticism and boosted hopes that quinoa can be successfully adapted to local soils.   Related: Bolivian women bank on sweet success of quinoa bars | Sam Jones    Early results suggest that certain quinoa varieties can yield up to four to five tonnes a hectare, as opposed to the usual two to three tonnes a hectare produced by most regional wheat farmers. At a time of mounting obesity in parts of the region, the grain\u2019s higher protein content is seen as a healthy boon. And with 500 litres of water needed to produce 1kg of quinoa, it\u2019s much less of a drain on scarce aquifer stocks than rice, which requires about 2,500 litres a kilo, or maize, which needs 1,200 litres. \u201cHere you see the biggest comparative advantage,\u201d said Abdullah al-Dakheel, who is also working on quinoa at ICBA. But some are questioning the wisdom of introducing quinoa into the region instead of increasing wheat yields and improving agricultural practices. The UN\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), which is working to introduce quinoa across the Middle East and north Africa, has been accused of pushing new crops without regard for local preferences or customs. There is also concern for the livelihoods of people living in the Andes, whose staple crop has experienced dramatic price fluctuations as its international popularity has grown. \u201cIt stands to reason that if you introduce production of a particular grain or food into a country where formerly it was not grown it will mean market competition for the traditional growers of that crop and a subsequent drop in the prices they receive,\u201d said Lynne Chatterton, author of Sustainable Dryland Farming. Peruvian and Bolivian farmers are feeling the effects of the falling market price. ICBA and FAO representatives acknowledge that plenty remains to be done before quinoa can be promoted in the Middle East. In the UAE, Rao and Dakheel say they\u2019re still working on maintaining quinoa\u2019s nutritional content, which has fallen when grown in highly saline soils. For the most part, however, they remain bullish about quinoa\u2019s prospects at a time when other crops aren\u2019t keeping pace with environmental changes and climatologists are forecasting that parts of the Middle East will be uninhabitable by 2050.  \u201cWe have plenty of land that\u2019s not being used optimally for agriculture and, given the market price and the increasing demand, we think this can succeed,\u201d said Marie-Louise Hayek, a project coordinator at FAO Lebanon. \u201cThirty crops provide 99% of the world\u2019s food needs. Just rice, wheat, maize and potatoes provide over 60%. We need to diversify our food supply in this region and elsewhere. We need to make ourselves less vulnerable if something happened,\u201d said Hayek. Beyond laboratories, quinoa is little known in the Middle East; fewer still know how to grow it. But \u201cif it works for the farmers, then I\u2019m sure it will work for us\u201d, says Mariam Saadek, as she bought a week\u2019s worth of vegetables at a market in central Cairo. \u201cWe\u2019re open to change.\u201d", "title": "Scientists go against the grain to make Dubai an unlikely quinoa hotspot | Peter Schwartzstein", "sentences": ["Ringed by inhospitable desert and assailed by fierce temperatures for much of the year, Dubai isn\u2019t the most natural of settings for bold farming experiments.", "\u201cIt can deal with high salinity, very little water and is seen as a climate change-resistant crop,\u201d said ICBA\u2019s Kameswara Nanduri Rao at his organisation\u2019s neatly landscaped centre, which sits amid the semi-arid scrubland on Dubai\u2019s outskirts."], "publicationDate": "2016-06-27T06:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/27/rise-fall-great-world-cities-5700-years-urbanisation-mapped", "tags": ["Cities", "History", "Data visualisations", "World news", "Urbanisation", "Population"], "article": "Urbanisation is one of the defining processes of modern times, with more than half of the world\u2019s population now living in cities, and new mega-metropolises mushrooming in Asia, Latin America and Africa. But a comprehensive, digitised database of city populations through world history has been lacking, with the United Nations\u2019 dataset only extending as far back as 1950. That was until recent research, published in the journal Scientific Data, transcribed and geocoded nearly 6,000 years of data (from 3700BC to AD2000). The report produced a gargantuan resource for scholars hoping to better understand how and why cities rise and fall \u2013 and allowed blogger Max Galka to produce a striking visualisation on his site Metrocosm. \u201cIn general, it helps us see human interaction with the environment,\u201d says lead author Meredith Reba of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Sciences. \u201cIt helps us to understand why settlements grew at the times they did.\u201d Mining tabular data from two tomes only available in print (the works of historian Tertius Chandler and political scientist George Modelski), Reba and her team mapped how city populations developed around the world over the millennia. The resulting dataset \u2013 available for free online \u2013 bills itself as \u201ca first step towards understanding the geographic distribution of urban populations throughout history and around the world\u201d.     Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo, Egypt. Photograph: Khaled El-Fiqi/EPA    The Sumerian city of Eridu marks the dawn of urbanisation in 3700BC, which trickles around Mesopotamia, Iran, India and China before eventually coming west to the Mediterranean. Mapping the data makes certain trends and patterns quite clear. For instance, it\u2019s notable that the earliest cities from China to Mesoamerica can all be found in a similar latitudinal belt, suggesting a possible link between early phases of urbanisation and climate.    As late as 1800, only 3% of the world\u2019s population lived in cities    Many more urban centres sprang up around the world thereafter but, as late as 1800, only 3% of the world\u2019s population lived in cities. Global urbanisation accelerated from the middle of the 19th century onwards. This precipitous rise is palpable in Galka\u2019s visualisation of the data (and in this one by Quartz), with a burst of cities clotting the map around 1875 and then again during the 20th century. The last entries in the database date to 2000AD; if updated to the present day, the database would include the stratospheric 21st-century growth in urban populations in Asia. Reba admits that the data \u201cis not final in any sense. Our aim was to pull together a richer, global urban population database, and to get this data into a usable format so it can be tested and improved.\u201d Though the report offers no theories of its own, Reba and her team hope that the results of their work will help researchers better explore a range of subjects that have long troubled scholars of urbanisation. Reba\u2019s initial motivation for the study was her frustration at the lack of data relating to her own field of interest \u2013 the relationship between the growth of cities and their proximity to agricultural land. But combined with other data and lines of inquiry, the database can be used to trace deeper ecological and climatic trends, as well as to study the effect of transport, trade routes, and shifting political boundaries on urban growth.   Related: The story of cities, part 1: how Alexandria laid foundations for the modern world    Reba didn\u2019t try to reconcile the multiple definitions of a city in Chandler and Modelski\u2019s works, which vary significantly by region and period. Chandler, for instance, generally considered any locality of greater than 20,000 people between AD800-1850 to be worthy of recording, but only counted places in Asia with a population of over 40,000 in that same period. Modelski\u2019s minimum thresholds changed over time: at least 10,000 inhabitants until 1000BC, 100,000 until AD1000, and one million people thereafter. They amassed their figures for urban populations from a plethora of sources, including censuses, traveller\u2019s accounts, tax rolls, gazetteers, disaster records, public bath rolls and archaeological records.  Though there is thorough data for a handful of Chinese localities, the new database is much more comprehensive in how it charts European urban development than the waxing and waning of cities in South Asia, Africa, and pre-Columbian America. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a Eurocentric view,\u201d Reba says, but she hopes new archeological and archival discoveries will help expand the database, and begin to fill in the more glaring geographic and temporal gaps.

Such a horse may be Hit The Lights (3.05), available at 7-1 for the sprint handicap. This six-year-old has a fair strike-rate on turf and has already scored twice since joining Dandy Nicholls for this season, both times with Danielle Mooney aboard. He managed to beat a small field at Catterick despite missing the kick but I hope he doesn\u2019t do that here because, with 14 rivals and an inside run being a major help, his chance would go up in smoke immediately. But it looks like that was a one-off and I still think he\u2019s handicapped to win when things fall right. His draw in stall two will help, as will the withdrawal of Coiste Bodhar, who may have taken him along faster than he really needs to go. There\u2019s 3-1 about Wotabreeze (2.00), who has the excellent Serena Brotherton aboard in the race for female amateur jockeys. John Quinn\u2019s chestnut has form figures of 212 since going handicapping and was beaten only by a very well treated rival last time.

Related: Time Test fights off Western Hymn to win Brigadier Gerard Stakes    I admire the spirit and of course we all remember what happened with Gleneagles last summer, when connections of the flash Irish miler were so picky about ground conditions that they didn\u2019t run him between Royal Ascot and Champions Day. That was dispiriting. And this is another dispiriting summer for anyone with a classy, top-of-the-ground sort. I begin to fear we\u2019ll never get consecutive dry days ever again. As a trainer said to me the other day: \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking to buy yearlings with great big feet\u201d. On the face of it, however, Sandown is drying out pretty quickly. The going description became \u2018good to soft, soft in places\u2019 on the round course last night, which is impressive, considering there had been standing water about 60 hours before. We have no GoingStick reading, however, which might have offered an additional insight. At the moment, I suspect readings for Sandown would differ widely depending on where you took them. The bend out of the back straight is likely to be pretty squelchy and I gather the rails there are being realigned to take the runners away from the worst of the ground. The next 36 hours will be important, with regard to the ground on which the Eclipse is run. Sandown might get another 10mm of rain in that time, in which case I\u2019d expect it to ride soft.   Related: Horse racing tips: Tuesday 28 June    One of the interesting features of this season, at a low level, has been the renewed success of the Kilkenny trainer Pat Shanahan, who you might remember as the man who won the Irish Derby on Zagreb 20 years ago. Shanahan had eight winners in Britain in 2013, his second year with a licence, but had been quieter for the last two years. He\u2019s already had six for this year, five of them at Hamilton, where he sends most of his raiders these days - I believe his main backer is a Scot, for what it\u2019s worth. Shanahan has a 22% strike-rate at Hamilton this year and a fair chance of three more winners there today. Jocks Wa Hae (2.30) is deservedly 2-1 to follow up his comfortable success of a fortnight ago. He\u2019s gone up 9lb and this is a faster surface, so there\u2019s a risk of him being outpaced, but cheekpieces and Joe Fanning may help. Lara Carbonara (3.00) carries a penalty for her success here five days ago. That was in a race for amateur riders, so the form may not be all that reliable, but she had already shown improved form as she was stepped up in distance. The 7-2 is fine against a Godolphin favourite, Long Call, who could probably have used more juice in the ground. Shanahan\u2019s third could be Born Innocent (4.00), whose only defeat in three Hamilton runs was when stepped up to a mile. This six furlongs is more like it for her and I liked the way she shrugged off trouble in running to get up last time. Tipping competition, day two Our winners so far: Monday Gran Canaria Queen 8-1 Matidia 11-4 Slemy 13-2 And our leader is: BearRides +13.50 \u2026 who had both Gran Canaria Queen and Slemy.

It\u2019s difficult to imagine one that wouldn\u2019t suit Sagan, who has enjoyed such a stranglehold on the green jersey since 2012 that Tour officials changed the points scoring system last year to give specialist sprinters a better chance of beating him. It didn\u2019t work. The right team-mates? Yes and no. While his team rides in the service of the GC contender Alberto Contador, Sagan is generally left to his own devices. The arrangement suits the 26-year-old Slovak just fine. What form is he in? Sagan ended last season on a high, winning the third stage of the Vuelta, before triumphing at the World Road Race Championships in Richmond, Virginia. Following a series of eight second-place finishes in the rainbow jersey, he triumphed at Gent-Wevelgem in April, secured his first Monument victory at the Tour of Flanders and won two stages at the Tour of California.Biggest plus point? It\u2019s difficult to tell, because he has so many: consistency, fearlessness in the saddle, incredible bike-handling skills and an apparently bottomless reservoir of good humour and youthful fecklessness. Biggest worry? Illness or an accident. Sagan was forced to pull out of last season\u2019s Vuelta after a crash caused by a race official\u2019s motorcycle. He\u2019d be secretly happy with \u2026 Nothing less than the green jersey, but will want a stage win or two. Despite romping home in the green jersey stakes last year, Sagan was forced to endure the frustration of five second-place finishes at the Tour. Marcel Kittel Etixx \u2013 Quick-Step     Marcel Kittel crosses the line to win the third stage of the Giro d\u2019Italia in May. Photograph: Luca Zennaro/EPA    Does the route suit him? Not especially. The 2016 Tour contains nine largely flat stages, but several have punchy uphill finishes that the German won\u2019t particularly enjoy. The right team-mates? Yes. The Etixx \u2013 Quick\u2011Step locomotive is the fastest lead-out train in the business. What form is he in? After a disastrous 2015 ruined by the adverse affects of a virus, Kittel has returned to full health and rediscovered his mojo. In this year\u2019s Dubai Tour he won two stages, the points category and overall victory. More recently he breasted the tape in two stages of the Giro d\u2019Italia, taking his first maglia rosa, before withdrawing after stage eight. Biggest plus point? On his day Kittel is virtually unbeatable and in Etixx \u2013 Quick-Step he has the luxury of a team tasked with the sole purpose of delivering him to the front of the pack with 150 metres to go. Biggest worry? Peter Sagan. He\u2019d be secretly happy with \u2026 a win in stage one from Mont Saint-Michel to Utah Beach Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, which looks a certainty to put one of the sprinters in the maillot jaune. Alexander Kristoff Katusha     Alexander Kristoff celebrates beating Peter Sagan of Slovokia win stage seven of the Tour of California in May. Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images    Does the route suit him? Without question. Rather than being an out-and-out speed-merchant, Kristoff will relish the prospect of long, undulating Classic-type stages that will tire out his sprint rivals. Throw in some bad weather and he\u2019ll be in hog heaven. The right team-mates? He\u2019s lucky to have a team around him at all. The Norwegian has lost his lead-out man, Luca Paolini, who received an 18-month ban after testing positive for cocaine in last year\u2019s Tour. In February, the UCI decided not to ban Katusha from racing after deciding the Italian\u2019s use of the drug was \u201csocial\u201d. What form is he in? Along with two stages wins in 2014, victory in that year\u2019s Milan-San Remo and the following year\u2019s Tour of Flanders remain the highlights of the big Norwegian\u2019s palmar\u00e8s. He\u2019s notched a few low-key wins in the build-up to this year\u2019s race. Biggest plus point? Has a definite edge over out-and-out speedsters in the mid-mountain stages. Biggest worry? Peter Sagan. He\u2019d be secretly happy with \u2026 equalling or bettering those two stage wins in 2014. Andr\u00e9 Greipel Lotto-Soudal     Andr\u00e9 Greipel wins the 12th stage of theGiro d\u2019Italia in May, where he demonstrated that he still has plenty left to offer at 34. Photograph: Luk Benies/AFP/Getty Images    Does the route suit him? Up to a point, but Sagan is invariably in the shake-up in sprint finishes and has the edge over the fast men when it comes to snaffling points on the medium mountain stages. The right team-mates? Yes. In Greg Henderson, Greipel has one of the best lead\u2011out men in the business and Lotto-Soudal proved their class and versatility as a unit with three consecutive stage victories in the Giro. Greipel was effusive in his praise for their efforts after winning two of them. What form is he in? Greipel will turn 34 during this year\u2019s Tour, so he\u2019s in the twilight of his career but remains a wily old dog with plenty of experience. Two Giro stage wins proves there\u2019s still plenty left in the tank. Biggest plus point? The popular German has ridden the past five Tours and won at least one stage in each, proving he has the beating of anyone on a good day at the office. Biggest worry? Peter Sagan. He\u2019d be secretly happy with \u2026 in descending order: an opening day stage win, a closing day stage win or \u2013 considering the return to form of his compatriot Kittel \u2013 any stage win. Mark Cavendish Dimension Data     Mark Cavendish can be expected to be in contention for the green jersey though may drop out to concentrate on the Olympics. Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images    Does the route suit him? It will suit him much the same as it suits any of the sprinters with whom he\u2019ll be contesting fast and furious finishes. The right team-mates? Apparently so. Cavendish has enjoyed plenty of success with his new South African team, who he praised for being \u201cconsistently visible\u201d throughout the Tour of California. There is, however, a possibility that he\u2019ll drop out of the Tour early to focus his energies on the Olympics. What form is he in? Overall first place in the Tour of Qatar and a win in the final stage of the Tour of California would suggest that things are ticking along nicely.Biggest plus point? As the last rider to win the Tour\u2019s points classification before Sagan burst on the scene and began his monopoly, Cavendish knows and has what it takes to win the green jersey. Biggest worry? Peter Sagan. He\u2019d be secretly happy with \u2026 like most of the sprinters, the Manx Missile will have his eye on a stint in yellow following a win in the opening stage, but will probably be content to emerge fit and healthy ahead of his tilt at Olympic gold.", "title": "Tour de France 2016 green jersey race: Peter Sagan and his main rivals", "sentences": ["In this year\u2019s Dubai Tour he won two stages, the points category and overall victory."], "publicationDate": "2016-06-28T13:00:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/29/talking-horses-wednesday-best-bets-latest-racing-news", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Today\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood Unsettled weather means there are plenty of non-runners already on the afternoon\u2019s only Flat card at Catterick, where there was 20mm of rain yesterday after declarations were made and the official going has changed for the second time to 24 hours, to good to soft. With more rain forecast mid-morning, there is no way to be sure it will stop there, so horses who have form with some cut are the only way to go. Noah Amor (2.30) is one who qualifies, having run well to finish third in a Ripon maiden on good to soft ground last time out. The race was run in a solid time too, which suggests his opening mark of 60 may well underestimate him. San Cassiano (3.00) is now favourite for the 12-furlong handicap following the scratching of Pertuis and has a solid chance at around 7-2. He has produced several decent efforts in recent weeks, including a good second at Musselburgh in May, and is 7lb below his last winning mark.

But Thakkar\u2019s beginnings make them even more impressive. At 15, he was living in Uganda as a refugee of the Rwandan genocide and had dropped out of school. He was born in Leicester after his parents fled from Uganda in 1972 when Idi Amin ordered the expulsion of the country\u2019s south Asian minority. Missing Africa, Thakkar\u2019s parents moved back to the continent \u2013 this time to Rwanda \u2013 in 1993.  However, come 1994, 12-year-old Thakkar and his family found themselves among more than 1,200 people sheltering from the genocide in the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines (the setting of the film, Hotel Rwanda). The family managed to escape to Kampala, Uganda, but Thakkar\u2019s parents, who had rebuilt their lives between 1972 and 1994, had now lost everything again. Speaking on Monday at a conference in Cape Town, South Africa, run by the Dell Women\u2019s Entrepreneur Network, Thakkar explained how the challenge of finding the seed money to start a business is even tougher for refugees. As a teenager in Uganda, people avoided his family for fear they would ask for a favour. So, aged 15, and frustrated by this situation, Thakkar dropped out of school to start in business. \u201cI wanted to help [my family] and I was trying desperately to get a loan and I ended up borrowing $5,000 from three different people.\u201d He spent half of the loan flying to Dubai where he bought computer parts - equipment that was tough to get hold of in Uganda. He then sold the parts back in Uganda, making a small profit.   Related: 'I was taken aback by the attitudes towards working mums'    Thakkar quickly saw there was a more efficient way to run his business: he set up an office in Dubai and sold technology equipment to businesses in Africa. By scaling up this simple method of buying and selling, Thakkar created the Mara Group, which (although it does not publish its figures) is said to be valued at $1bn. Over the past 20 years the group has diversified with investments in sectors including telecoms, banking, property and agriculture. The business now operates in 25 African countries and employs around 11,000 people. Thakkar emphasises the power of partnerships, particularly where they mix global success with local knowledge. With that in mind he moved into investment in 2013, partnering with Bob Diamond, former UK boss of Barclays. Together they founded Atlas Mara, which invests in African financial services firms. The business, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange, raised $625m from investors. Thakkar\u2019s business acumen and networking skills are clear, but he says profit is not how he defines success. Instead, he says it is \u201cdefined by the number of lives you\u2019re touching and making a difference to\u201d.  Thakkar launched the Mara Foundation, a social enterprise, in 2009. Having experienced the struggle of access to funding when starting a business, he wanted to create an organisation that mentors and supports small business across Africa, with a focus on young and women entrepreneurs. \u201cTo see the response I got as a young entrepreneur, to see the response my mum and sisters got as women entrepreneurs: it was never a level playing field,\u201d he says. The Mara Foundation\u2019s mentoring initiatives include Mara Mentor, a free online mentoring platform, Mara One-on-One, which connects startups with established entrepreneurs, and Mara Women, which focuses on connecting female entrepreneurs. As part of his work as chairman of the UN Foundation\u2019s Global Entrepreneurs Council, Thakkar will travel to refugee camps in Jordan in August. He is going to seek examples of entrepreneurialism that he has heard are growing in the camps, such as gown rental businesses, barbers and hairdressers. \u201cBeing a refugee makes you more hungry. And it\u2019s a different type of hunger, it\u2019s not like \u2018yeah yeah, I want to be an entrepreneur\u2019. It\u2019s like, \u2018I need to make a living. I need to survive\u2019.

Eclipse day at Sandown Park on Saturday, when he is expected to ride the Royal Ascot winner Hawkbill in the feature race, will be Buick\u2019s final day in the saddle until early August.   Related: Clive Cox hopes he can keep punching above his weight in Sandown\u2019s Eclipse    He will be forced to miss the July meeting at Newmarket next week, the Irish Oaks, the King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot and all five days of Glorious Goodwood, one of the most valuable meetings of the season.

Perhaps McIlroy, as a significantly more high-profile and handsomely rewarded Irish golfer simply has to deal with that. The rest of us can raise a smile over issues of perception. Lowry, like McIlroy, is perfectly entitled to remove his name from the Olympic golf reckoning. Like McIlroy, we should respect his reasons for doing so. This week, there is another reason to both afford Lowry backing and a touch of professional sympathy.   Related: Jason Day\u2019s Zika withdrawal highlights golf\u2019s vexed Olympic relationship    Keith Pelley\u2019s whirlwind entry into the chief executive post at the European Tour has seen plenty noise, plenty promise, but thus far minimal delivery. That isn\u2019t a criticism; Pelley is still too freshly immersed in the post to be properly assessed, just as the tour\u2019s sponsorship and commercial wings were never going to evolve overnight. Pelley has talked the talk, with the jury out on what happens next. An example of Pelley\u2019s bullishness \u2013 and this has been consistent \u2013 regarded a challenge to the PGA Tour but directly impacted on Lowry. The European Tour withdrew sanction of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational of 2016, which starts on Thursday in Akron, on the basis it conflicts directly with the 100th anniversary of the French Open. Those appearing at the Bridgestone won\u2019t be afforded Race to Dubai ranking points or, more pertinently, those for the Ryder Cup. France has all manner of enhancements, which was duly sufficient to draw a stellar field including McIlroy and the Masters champion, Danny Willett. Neither may have played at Castle Stuart anyway, but there is no question the entry list at next week\u2019s Scottish Open has been negatively affected, in part, by this French push. This also all left Lowry, through not fault whatsoever of his own, in something of a schedule predicament. His Bridgestone win of 2015 was a tremendous one, announcing a man once mocked to the point where he was deliberately drawn alongside two similarly broad individuals at a US Open on to a global stage. In Ireland, the celebration of Lowry\u2019s success was so brilliant it reminded us that few other nations embrace their sportspeople so warmly. Lowry has never lacked talent \u2013 the annoyance he commonly displays towards himself on the course demonstrates a desire that is maybe masked by an outwardly happy-go-lucky attitude \u2013 but the claiming of a WGC suddenly afforded him a loftier status. The immensely likeable 29-year-old\u2019s own approach even seems to have become more focussed over the past 10 months, perhaps through a realisation that he can scale more epic heights than even he had acknowledged.   Related: Colin Montgomerie qualifies for the Open for first time since 2010    Lowry, as defending champion, rightly opted to return to Akron this week. Common courtesy met basic logic there. But this represented a serious risk, for a player with dreams of a maiden Ryder Cup appearance in September who is flirting around the edges of qualification and, being blunt, has not fully built upon last year\u2019s triumph. While the European Tour was happy to bask in Lowry\u2019s glory of 2015 when partly sanctioning the Bridgestone, there has been no statement to make it perfectly plain that the man from Offaly goes back to the same venue with best wishes under unique circumstances. If tokenism, that would at least have represented a human touch. Darren Clarke, surely, should look favourably upon a competitor placed into a dilemma on the simple basis he was successful. Hopefully Clarke does, if indeed Lowry ends up on the Ryder Cup fringes. Lowry is perhaps due a break. His role in the chaotic closing Sunday of the recent US Open was ultimately overlooked but it can surely be said with certainty that he, like Dustin Johnson and others, was negatively affected by the rules farce which ensued on the closing stretch. Lowry held a four-shot lead with 18 holes to play, the level with which that concession hurt him obvious even upon first glance as Johnson was lifting the trophy. The Irishman had played beautifully for three and a half days, raising widespread hopes of victory for a man who plays golf with a wonderful simplicity. Lowry may not be an ideal athlete \u2013 that in itself draws smiles from golfing traditionalists \u2013 but his swing and pace of play are due the utmost respect. Johnson was to upstage Lowry at Oakmont. Despite the European Tour\u2019s wishes for the French Open to do likewise this week, there is cause to root for Lowry on the other side of the Atlantic.", "title": "Why should Shane Lowry\u2019s defence of Bridgestone title hit Ryder Cup hopes?", "sentences": ["Those appearing at the Bridgestone won\u2019t be afforded Race to Dubai ranking points or, more pertinently, those for the Ryder Cup."], "publicationDate": "2016-06-30T08:00:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/30/live-racing-thursday-30-june-seven-line-up-eclipse-stakes-sandown", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "11.45am Time Test team buoyed by Sandown Eclipse going report Tony Paley: The Gurkha will face six runners in Coral-Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on Saturday.

Related: Horse racing tips: Thursday 30 June    Hatsaway\u2019s ability to handle the track needs to be taken on trust, but he went around Brighton smoothly enough to record a narrow win in early May and improved again for a more convincing success at Salisbury earlier this month off a 4lb higher mark. The five-year-old joined Pat Phelan from Clive Brittain at the start of the year and has made just three starts for the yard, and while he is up another 5lb today, there is every chance that his progress will continue. Shanghai Glory (7.15) also improved last time out when he was narrowly beaten into second place and should go close on the same card from a 2lb higher mark.

It was Godolphin versus Coolmore once more and on this occasion Dubai trumped Ireland as Hawkbill stayed on dourly to beat The Gurkha. No one had more cause to be delighted about the outcome than the winning jockey, William Buick, who now begins a month-long ban, the result of a meltdown at Chantilly a fortnight ago, where he caused interference and then, when handed a fortnight\u2019s suspension, responded by telling the stewards they were corrupt. The ban was promptly doubled and Buick, now suitably contrite, should consider himself lucky his \u201choliday\u201d will not be longer. He declined to go back over that ground here, saying only of this success: \u201cI needed it. It\u2019s probably the most timely winner I\u2019ve ever had, to be honest with you.\u201d It might be said with as much justice that Godolphin needed this.

Related: Sandown win boosts Roger Charlton before Time Test Eclipse Stakes bid    The more recent policy of having horses in stables all around Britain and Ireland has borne fruit but Hawkbill, trained by Charlie Appleby, is the first Godolphin horse based in Newmarket to win a domestic Group One for almost two years. \u201cI love Charlie, I love Saeed [bin Suroor], I love our own trainers,\u201d said John Ferguson, Godolphin\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut the important thing is for the team as a whole to be winning races worldwide. \u201cThat\u2019s what Godolphin is all about. We\u2019ve been having a great time in Australia and America, so it\u2019s very important to be winning big races here too, whoever they\u2019re trained by.\u201d In Hawkbill, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s outfit now have a standard-bearer for the most high-profile races, since it is not at all hard to imagine him stepping up in distance for Ascot\u2019s King George in three weeks. Buick, naturally, might prefer that he did not run again until August at least. He joked that he had argued for Hawkbill to go straight to the Arc in October. Appleby begged for time to formulate a plan. Temperament seems to have been a big issue with this handsome chestnut, as all the winning connections spoke of how he had \u201cgrown up\u201d. His reappearance run was at Newmarket, about a mile from his stable, in the hope that he might remain calm in the buildup so close to home. He was able to win at Royal Ascot despite getting very warm in the paddock. Here, however, Hawkbill was so placid in the preliminaries that Appleby turned to Ferguson and muttered concern that perhaps this was a bad sign. Instead, it seems maturity has been achieved. The result brought more frustration for fans of The Gurkha, who had to be taken back off the winner\u2019s heels at the turn for home, prompting the stewards to have a look before concluding no offence had been committed. Ryan Moore, The Gurkha\u2019s jockey, appeared thoroughly disgusted about something as he debriefed the trainer, Aidan O\u2019Brien.   Related: Derby-winning trainer Dermot Weld\u2019s horse fails post-race drugs test    \u201cIt was a little bit rough off of the bend,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that The Gurkha had \u201cjust come alive a little bit early\u201d in consequence.

O\u2019Brien hopes to turn him out again in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood in a little over three weeks\u2019 time. He could have done without the morning rain that made the going soft once more, as could the third home, Time Test. His trainer, Roger Charlton, is thinking of the Juddmonte International at York, a racecourse where the racing manager of Time Test\u2019s owner is chairman. \u201cIf anyone waters the ground up there in the next six weeks, they\u2019ll be going to Saudi Arabia,\u201d Charlton said, with zero pretence at making a joke of it.", "title": "William Buick wins Eclipse on Hawkbill after thrilling duel with The Gurkha", "sentences": ["It was Godolphin versus Coolmore once more and on this occasion Dubai trumped Ireland as Hawkbill stayed on dourly to beat The Gurkha."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-02T16:36:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/02/icc-cricket-league", "tags": ["International Cricket Council", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Dave Richardson, the chief executive of the International Cricket Council, remains hopeful of pushing through the creation of league structures for Test, one-day international and Twenty20 cricket later this year following opposition to the plan during the governing body\u2019s recent annual conference.

Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are among those to have publicly voiced their concerns about the idea of splitting Test cricket into two tiers during the past week but Richardson is optimistic that his model, which is slated to run from 2019 and is aimed at reviving interest in the sport, will be adopted. Richardson, whose plan has the backing of the players\u2019 union Fica, said: \u201cThe member countries acknowledge and recognise the importance of international cricket across all its three formats and are committed to ensuring that it continues to grow in relevance and value for cricket fans around the world. \u201cThis is a complex issue on many levels, but I am heartened by the progress that has been made to date and during these meetings and look forward to the next meeting in Dubai.\u201d The ICC has also announced that a new draft of the governing body\u2019s constitution will be drawn up over the coming weeks and debated at the next board meeting in October, with chairman Shashank Manohar looking to roll back the 2014 changes that saw the so-called \u2018Big Three\u2019 of India, Australia and England take greater control of the sport and allocate themselves an increased proportion of revenues from global events. Two changes to the use of technology in international cricket have emerged from the conference, with the umpire\u2019s call area in relation to the stumps in lbw decisions set to be increased in size and the scheduling of a trial in the use of the TV official for adjudicating no-balls in \u201can upcoming one-day series\u201d.

The Conservative party, the party of continuity and tradition, is now the cause of the greatest constitutional crisis in modern times. The party of business is now the source of reckless economic turmoil. The natural party of government is now presiding over paralysis in Westminster and Whitehall. The party of the British bulldog spirit is now leading our great country towards rudderless introspection.   Related: \u2018We are the 48%\u2019: tens of thousands march in London for Europe    There is something almost grotesque in the contrast between the self-indulgence of the Conservative leadership contest and the anxiety gripping millions of families worried about the future. The media swarms around Michael Gove\u2019s self-absorbed pronouncements justifying the tawdry betrayal of his friends. A nervous nation, unsure what it has done to itself, is subject to the tedious, vituperative comments from one Conservative nonentity about another. No wonder Theresa May \u2013 a diligent, hard-working if unimaginative politician \u2013 stands out as a grownup in that political playground. This cannot go on. Somehow we must navigate the country through the months ahead. The government not only finds itself without leadership, it has no plan, no consensus and no clue about what it wants to do in the future. The only thing it agrees on is that the UK\u00a0should leave the EU. But how, when\u00a0and to what end all remain unanswered. It enjoys a mandate to quit, but\u00a0no mandate as to how this should be done. This is partly the result of the unforgivable cynicism of a Brexit campaign that refused to tell voters what comes next. But it is also a consequence of contradictory opinions: the hedge fund owners who financed the campaign want to turn the City into a low\u2013regulation Dubai; Boris Johnson wanted to open Britain to far-flung continents; Michael Gove wants to close Britain against incomers; and most Brexiteers witter about maintaining access to the single market while not being subject to its rules, apparently oblivious to the glaring contradiction. This debilitating cocktail of hubris, incompetence and dishonesty must be overcome if the country is to move forward. This is what we should do. First, each Conservative leadership candidate must set out, in detail, what they think our future relationship with Europe should be. Second, the new prime minister, to be announced on 9\u00a0September, should immediately publish a white paper setting out a full plan. And third, he or she must then seek a democratic mandate for their plan in an early general election. The notion that it should be left to Conservative members to handpick a new prime minister for what in effect will be a new government pursuing new priorities is absurd.           EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013 video    This election would also give all parties the opportunity to set out their stalls on what our new relationship with Europe should be. As Tim Farron has made clear, the Liberal Democrats will fight that election on a patriotically pro-European platform. Labour, whether under Jeremy Corbyn or not, will need to make up its mind. Importantly, the election must be held before any attempt is made to activate article 50, the legal mechanism triggering the negotiations for EU exit. Starting that clock ticking before people have had an opportunity to cast a judgment on what life would actually look like outside the EU would be deeply undemocratic. The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 envisaged exceptional circumstances in which an early election can be held, and those provisions should be invoked. The baton then moves to the newly elected parliament. It will have two tasks: MPs must scrutinise the government\u2019s specific plan to ensure it is legal and workable, and, crucially, article 50 should only be triggered following a vote of consent from MPs. Some have argued that the prime minister can invoke article 50 on her/his own, using royal prerogative powers. Many top legal experts, including Lord Pannick and Lord Lester, disagree. In any event, there is recent parliamentary precedent. Under the Lisbon treaty, the UK was granted the right to a \u201cmass opt out\u201d from EU laws governing police and judicial cooperation. In the coalition government, both parties agreed to exercise this power, while negotiating to preserve the most important crime-fighting measures, such as the European arrest warrant. We went to parliament to seek a mandate for those talks in 2013, and returned again to parliament in 2014 to seek approval for the package we had negotiated.   Related: Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom to contend for PM as Gove\u2019s bid fades    If a vote at the beginning and the end of a negotiation was good enough for a specific area of EU policy, it should also be good enough for the complete decoupling of the UK from the EU. Finally, the definitive, negotiated terms both of our exit from, and our future relationship with, the EU must then be put back to parliament for a vote of consent. The EU referendum has exploded constitutional, political and economic conventions. Our country is in a tailspin. An election of a new parliament in which MPs act responsibly to manage our historic divorce from the EU is the only way to forge some order out of the present chaos.", "title": "Britain must have a general election before activating article 50 | Nick Clegg", "sentences": ["But it is also a consequence of contradictory opinions: the hedge fund owners who financed the campaign want to turn the City into a low\u2013regulation Dubai; Boris Johnson wanted to open Britain to far-flung continents; Michael Gove wants to close Britain against incomers; and most Brexiteers witter about maintaining access to the single market while not being subject to its rules, apparently oblivious to the glaring contradiction."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-03T16:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/04/basra-british-iraq-oil-boomtown-legacy-chilcot-saddam", "tags": ["Cities", "Iraq", "Iraq war inquiry", "World news", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Saddam Hussein", "Politics", "Tony Blair"], "article": "Laden with nets and reeking of rotten fish, the rusting dhow Ameera has just been moored up in the small Iraqi port of Al-Faw, 50 miles south-east of Basra.

The journey has gone pretty well. The three-man crew caught three very large croakers in Kuwaiti waters and then sold them on to Pakistani traders in Iranian waters, all the while evading the coastguards of three nations. But the money made (about US$1,250) is not enough for Abu Karar to take back anything to his family. And often, these illegal trips carry a heavier price. \u201cI have been caught more than 30 times,\u201d says the captain. \u201cThe Kuwaitis beat us and the Iranians put us in jail \u2013 but what other options do I have? We are a trampled nation.\u201d Thirteen years on from the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, Iraq is a country still dogged by war and corruption, pulled apart by opposing political and religious forces, and struggling to define its character.      Basra\u2019s historic canals are now swamps of rubbish. Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    The trauma is all too apparent in Basra, the largest city in southern Iraq \u2013 whose six-year period under British control, following Saddam\u2019s overthrow, will come under renewed scrutiny this week with the expected release of the Chilcot report. The report will examine both the decision to go to war and Britain\u2019s conduct in the invasion and its aftermath. All around the city, the legacy of that time hangs heavy. \u201cI am 52, and have been working since I was 12,\u201d Abu Karar says. \u201cI was a fruit picker, a sailor, a teacher, a conscript soldier in the war with Iran, and now I am a captain. But in all those years, I never lived through such hardship as I have lived from 2003 up to this hour.\u201d The captain\u2019s life story spans the wars and tragedies of Basra over the past four decades \u2013 starting, as with everything in Iraq, with Saddam.  \u201cHe began the destruction of this country,\u201d Abu Karar says, his usual smile replaced by a deep sadness. \u201cWhen the war with Iran started [in 1980], our land became a land of war. My family fled to Karbala [a city near Baghdad], and I was conscripted to the army.\u201d The geography that had once made Basra a critical location for trade and cultural exchange transformed it into the gate through which every invading army marched. \u201cI spent seven years here as a soldier. I watched tens of thousands of men crossing these waters, wave after wave, just to slaughter each other. When we came back after the war, our old wooden dhows were burned. Our farms had become an empty desert, dug with war trenches, where nothing can grow even today.\u201d The ousting of Saddam and the arrival of the British, he says, brought renewed hope for the city and its people. \u201cWhen another war started, and we saw the British tanks drive through the city, we were told that life will be very beautiful. \u2018Things will change,\u2019 they said, \u2018we will all get better.\u2019\u201d Abu Karar looks despairing, like someone who has been cheated in a deal. For a moment he is silent, amid the harsh metallic sound of the dhows grinding against each other. But then he smiles again. \u201cActually, I have got one thing from the British. In the chaos after their invasion, I squatted on government land and built a concrete shack on it.\u201d Oil money The captain lives in one of many squatters\u2019 settlements that have sprouted up around Basra, on public land seized by people fleeing the poverty of the countryside. His home is built from dark grey breeze blocks on a vast, desolate piece of land; only the pictures of Shia clergy above the door add any colour to the scene. From his doorway, beyond a deep ditch filled with green sewage, a glittering state-of-the-art stadium is visible. Basra Sports City is one of many projects the Iraqi government began building at the end of the last decade, when oil prices reached US$100 a barrel and Basra, the country\u2019s boomtown, was producing billions of dollars-worth of crude.     The unfinished Basra Sports City complex. Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad for the Guardian    The price of oil is now half that \u2013 but the hundreds of wells scattered through the city still spew their columns of black smoke into the sky, covering Basra in a permanently grubby haze. From 2010 onwards, hotels, travel agencies, cafes and restaurants mushroomed in Basra, as the city became a hub for international oil companies. A new mall, Basra Times Square, brought international brands and a profusion of gleaming showrooms that exhibited row-upon-row of SUVs.     I never lived through such hardship as I have lived from 2003 up to this hour  Abu Karar     In some parts of the city, house prices remain higher than in Dubai or Beirut. Fresh roses from the Netherlands are delivered each day to two florists catering for the new, oil-wealth elite. \u201cI know there is money in Basra,\u201d Abu Karar says. \u201cI can see the money everywhere in the massive houses \u2013 I just can\u2019t touch it.\u201d But beyond the facade of unnaturally lit boulevards decorated with imported palm trees lies the real city, where raw sewage flows through Basra\u2019s historic canals \u2013 some of which are now swamps of plastic and rubbish. The stadium, and many of the bridges and public buildings begun here during those boom years, now stand idle and unfinished. The fall in oil prices stopped the city government from paying its bills; as in the rest of Iraq, existing funds had been long ago squandered by corruption and kickbacks. Blair\u2019s Basra Judge Wael Abdul Latif stands up and shuffles across his shabby office towards a cluttered cabinet. After rummaging for a bit, he returns carrying a pink Manila folder. With pride, he lays out its contents \u2013 a series of wrinkled, faded A4 coloured printouts \u2013 straightening and smoothing their frayed edges. These pages are a reminder of Latif\u2019s tenure as the governor of Basra, one of Britain\u2019s very few allies during its time in control of the city.

The judge shows me another image of his meetings with British and Iraqi officers. \u201cBasra was the first province in Iraq to organise local elections. The British worked well, they met with local sheikhs and attended their tribal councils. When I asked their military for a bridge, they built it in one month.\u201d A printout of an official portrait of the Queen has faded into pinkish hues: \u201cI had a good relationship with all their commanders, and also with Blair,\u201d Latif says with deep nostalgia. \u201cI was even invited to meet the Queen once.\u201d He walks away from the pictures, and slumps back in his chair. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want us to succeed,\u201d he says, before offering a familiar lament as to why his rule, and that of the British, failed in Basra.    I had a good relationship with Blair ... I was even invited to meet the Queen once  Judge Wael Abdul Latif     \u201cThey, the Iranians, worked against us from day one, directly or through their Islamic parties that dominated the city council. Every time I wanted to start a major project or bring investment to the city, the council members would hamper all my efforts and block any new project.\u201d The judge\u2019s complaints are contradicted by Abu Hashem, however, a high-ranking Shia security official who has had close links to Iranian intelligence for more than two decades. He was among the first to enter Basra from Iran after Saddam\u2019s demise, and says that back then in early 2003, the Iranians were as clueless about how to deal with the new situation as the British were.  Days after the fall of the city to British troops, a column of military jeeps carrying a small group of seasoned Shia fighters and intelligence officers (who had been based in Iran for the past two decades) crossed the Iranian border and headed for Basra. Ostensibly, their job was to prepare the ground for the main exiled Shia opposition forces to resettle in Iraq. In fact, their principal objective was to test the British response to their presence.     British Lynx helicopters on combat patrol over Basra in 2003. Photograph: Ian Jones/Daily Telegraph/PA    \u201cIt was a time of confusion when we entered Iraq,\u201d Abu Hashem says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what will happen. In Iran we were always told that our war was with Great Satan [the US] and the British, so are we going to fight the Americans and the British now? Will they open fire on us?\u201d Back in Iran, there was similar confusion among intelligence, military and religious leaders. \u201cSome in the Republic [Iran] thought a weak Saddam was better than a US army stationed next door,\u201d Abu Hashem explains. \u201cThe more ideological elements argued that we should fight the US; they even wanted to issue a fatwa calling for a Jihad against the invasion. In the end we were told it was a time of \u2018wait and see\u2019.\u201d In fact, the column of jeeps drove all the way to Basra unopposed. Abu Hashem and his fellow exiled leaders realised not only that the British were not going to shoot at them, they were going to be their new allies \u2013 depending on the Shia Islamic parties to run the city, and give the impression that a sense of normality was returning.  Soon after these new arrivals set up their headquarters in Basra\u2019s public buildings, however, a campaign of assassinations against former Ba\u2019athists and army officers started. \u201cThe assassinations intimidated the whole of the society,\u201d says Abu Salam, a long-time civil rights campaigner and union activist in Basra. \u201cThe new parties reconstructed the society as a case of victor and vanquished. The victors were now the Shia, whose religious practices had been banned under Saddam, and the vanquished were the Sunnis, who were all labelled Ba\u2019athists \u2013 even though many, if not most, of the Ba\u2019athists in Basra were themselves Shia. \u201cI had no illusions that the occupation that could lead to state building,\u201d Abu Salam says. \u201cIt was obvious this regime would never succeed.\u201d     A British army corporal lowers the union flag during a 2007 ceremony to mark the transfer of control of a military base in Basra. Composite: Nabil Al-Jurani/AP    While the British in Basra \u2013 like the Americans in Baghdad \u2013 indulged in widespread acts of self-delusion about progress and democracy, the new Islamist arrivals dominated the new political scene here, and their military wings became the cornerstones of the newly established security forces. \u201cBasra is where all the resources of Iraq are based,\u201d Abu Salam says. \u201cFrom the early days, the politics of the city became a struggle about which party and which militia controlled what resource. The British forces were trying to establish relations with all these parties, and to avoid a clash at any cost.\u201d Meanwhile, a more radical impoverished youth, inspired and led by the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, discovered a niche for themselves by fighting the British. In the streets of Basra, a plethora of smaller militias that existed as nothing but mini-mafia cartels took their share of the city\u2019s wealth.  These militias, intertwined with tribes and smuggling cartels, dominated every aspect of commercial life in Basra. They ran 62 floating docks for smuggling oil. Nine different \u201csecurity units\u201d worked in the port, obtaining bribes and fees. The militias and the religious parties became dispensers of justice and patronage \u2013 the gateway through which any major transaction had to be completed. Abu Hashem, the Shia security official, explains this phenomena: \u201cThe years of exile in Iran were hard. If you worked hard by yourself, you could read books and teach yourself something \u2013 but in general we were left alone, without any chance to develop.     Militia fighters chant slogans against Isis in Basra, 2014, following their call to arms by a leading Shia cleric. Photograph: Nabil Al-Jurani/AP    \u201cI\u2019d told my compatriots [in Iran] that when we went back to Iraq, people would despise us because we were exiles. But I was wrong. I found out that even the humblest of exiles \u2013 those who had nothing to do in Iran but loiter \u2013 started getting positions for themselves. They saw a void, and they filled it.\u201d  He adds: \u201cThe Iranians, like everyone in this region \u2013 the Syrians; even America\u2019s allies the Saudis and Emiratis \u2013 they all wanted this American experiment to fail, and they all worked to make it fail. They allowed Al-Qaida to enter, and Iran started forming \u2018special groups\u2019 to target British and American interests.\u201d In 2007, just as British and American pronouncements about their successes \u2013 and the readiness of Iraqi security forces \u2013 were becoming more forceful, the British were in fact retreating into smaller and smaller bases. And this gave the city\u2019s insurgents encouragement to fire daily barrages of katyusha rockets into those bases. Red lines Muhssen is tall, built like a wrestler with small, sharp eyes.

Every month they give their protectors a gift.\u201d     Iraqis gather at the site of a car bomb attack in Basra, October 2015, which killed more than 50 people.

When we first came to Basra, we were full of zeal. We thought we will crush the gangs and the militias. But then we realised they are the prevailing powers in this city, not the government, so we withdrew. Even our bosses draw red lines that we should not cross; they know their own limitations.\u201d As in other corrupt, oil-rich countries, the wealth did not trickle down in Iraqi society, but rather created a new, kleptocratic class of militia commanders, party officials and clan leaders. \u201cBasra is run by mafias,\u201d Muhssen says. \u201cThe head of the mafia is the city council: they divide the projects amongst them, and at every stage they have to be bribed. There are sharks that run the oil and electricity projects; if you stand against them, they will hit you. These are the tyrants of this city.\u201d According to Muhssen, two of the strongest clans in Basra, who until a few years ago ran extensive networks of oil smuggling tankers (and had some clan members as high-ranking commanders in the militias of Moqtada), are now major construction contractors in the city, working with international oil firms.

When you ask them why they are arming, they say they are waiting for the state to weaken \u2013 before they rip it apart.\u201d Muhssen says he came to realise that his strong physique, his gun and his rank meant nothing in the supposedly calm city of Basra. \u201cWhen there is no respect for the state, no fear of the security forces, how will these people respect me?\u201d Before leaving, he points across the street. \u201cDo you see that traffic policemen?\u201d A lone, middle-aged policeman in a uniform of white shirt, blue trousers and a white cap is directing traffic late into the night. Above him looms a massive bridge with its middle section missing, the construction company having stopped working for lack of funds. \u201cThis is the only decent person working for the state,\u201d Muhssen tells me, \u201cbecause he is actually doing something.

Interestingly, Fallon still had a 20% strike-rate at the Yorkshire track in recent seasons, producing nine winners over four years, despite the general decline in his quality of rides. Ben Curtis can\u2019t hope to be in that league yet but he\u2019s two from eight at \u2018Ponte Carlo\u2019 this year and has an excellent chance of another win there today on Zebedaios (3.40).

He finished strongly once more to land a Haydock handicap in May, prompting Ellison to describe him as \u201ca superstar\u201d who would be in Listed company at least by next year. But the handicapper has taken a conservative view, raising him just 6lb, which ought to be beatable back at the scene of his first win. He\u2019s only 7-2 in a big field but I\u2019m sticking with him.  Later, the in-form Roger Charlton has an interesting 6-1 shot in Executor (4.40), who surely needed his reappearance run in April, when the trainer\u2019s strike-rate was just 10%. It would be easy to look at his juvenile record and scoff at the fact that his only win was against four rivals at Bath but he looked progressive that day and his two defeats that season were in warm races at Newbury and Newmarket when there was an unsuitable amount of give in the ground.

I learned this in a new way, when one of my tweets about Isis and Islam went viral on \u201cMuslim Twitter\u201d. The volume of response from Muslim men and women around the world (35,000 retweets and counting) isn\u2019t what\u2019s blowing my mind today, as I watch the tweet take on new lives of its own as it spreads. What\u2019s awe-inspiring is what these ordinary people are saying, and what we can all learn from it. Last Friday night just before I tucked into bed before the holiday weekend, I did something I do dozens of times a day: I tweeted a random thought that popped into my head.    Dude ISIS is bombing Muslim people in Muslim communities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan how is ISIS Muslim no they&#39;re psychopaths&mdash; Xeni Jardin (@xeni) July 3, 2016    The terrorist organization had killed hundreds of Muslim people in Muslim targets in recent attacks, and the now familiar response from cable news hosts and would-be presidents was repeated again: Muslims are dangerous, and \u201cmoderate Muslims\u201d need to speak out strongly against Isis. It\u2019s their responsibility, because at some level, they\u2019re all the same.  On US social media that night, as news broke of each new attack on an Islamic target by the so-called Islamic State, I saw not even a hint of the outcry that followed attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino, London or Paris. No \u201cPray for Baghdad,\u201d no \u201cJe Suis Saudi Arabia\u201d on western Twitter. No memes of unified global grief. Just more fear, racism and dehumanizing of a label that applies to millions of ordinary people all over the world: \u201cMuslim\u201d. In America, it\u2019s our new N-word. America, it seems, feels no empathy for a group of people we can\u2019t accept as fully human. I tweeted my random thought and went to bed. When I woke up, on the Saturday of the three-day Independence Day weekend, the most patriotic and nationalist holiday of them all for my country \u2013 there was news of more Isis suicide bombings. And my silly late-night tweet had gone really really viral. It wasn\u2019t being retweeted by the thousands per minute here in Los Angeles where delicious Fourth of July barbecue smoke was wafting into my window, not in the US at all. It was going viral in Saudi Arabia. Pakistan. Bangladesh. Turkey. Iraq. Some of the same places where, as our holiday weekend here in America unfolded, Isis attacks were also unfolding. Muslims were dying. And fellow Muslims were pouring their grief into Twitter. When the suicide bombing hit Medina, Islam\u2019s second most sacred site, my silly tweet was shared at a new velocity. Fifteen thousand retweets turned into 25,000, to 35,0000, and with that came a flood of previously unheard voices, Muslim people on the other side of the internet, all skimming Twitter on their phones just like me and my friends, feeling outrage, empathy, laughing, doing what we do with social media. Connecting to ideas, and connecting with each other around the ideas they encounter. This time, it just happened to be one of my own. \u201cI would thank you from the bottom of my heart, but for you my heart has no bottom\ud83d\udc90,\u201d wrote Qasem Al -Ali in London.

Lots of Burrows horses ran well, including Massaat, who was runner-up in the 2,000 Guineas, but he only managed two winners from his first 32 runners, which was surely not the initial impact he was hoping to make.   Related: Horse racing tips: Wednesday 6 July    The available evidence suggests his horses have now run into form, or else his luck has taken a dramatic turn for the better, since four of his last five runners have won, including Markaz in the Chipchase at Newcastle last weekend. He could have a double today, at short prices, through Mubajal (7.30) at Bath tonight and Dheyaa (6.15) at Kempton. Mubajal, at 11-8, should know more than when a running-on third on his debut. He\u2019s closely related to Makfi, being by Dubawi out of a half-sister to the Guineas winner. Dheyaa, a 3-1 shot for her handicap debut, didn\u2019t show much last year but nearly got a maiden victory on her reappearance at Brighton in May. She starts on what looks a very reasonable rating and the third horse from her last race has since been second in Listed company, for what it\u2019s worth. I shall give another chance to Hurricane Volta (7.45), a good winner for this feature in March who has continued to run well since. He still looks fairly handicapped and appeals at 9-2 for this step up to two miles.

The news feels both huge and sometimes silly. In the past few hours I have heard repeated riffs on the Tory leadership contest that say: \u201cThe last man standing will be a woman.\u201d I saw yet another panel of men debating which female politician would take over. I watched Iain Duncan Smith saying he would be fine with a woman leader as though this was a radical proposition. Self-awareness is in short supply lately so thank God for the fun of all sorts of women signing up to being \u201cbloody difficult\u201d on Twitter. Ken Clarke\u2019s remark was surely a huge boost to Theresa May because of his reference to Thatcher. A symptom of how far right the atmosphere has become is that Clarke is our favourite Tory pet, seeming liberal and sensible with his hinterland and Hush Puppies. We ignore for now his links to the tobacco industry or that he introduced the \u201cinternal market\u201d into the NHS. I would love for a woman to appear quite so relaxed on TV while bitching about her colleagues and be lauded the way Clarke has been, for it\u2019s not difficult to be a difficult woman. The bar is set low. If you speak up or assume any kind of power, you will be called that awful word \u201cfeisty\u201d or just \u201cimpossible\u201d. Your friends will buy you mugs with slogans on that say: \u201cWell behaved women rarely make history\u201d (a quote attributed to several, including Eleanor Roosevelt and Marilyn Monroe). People will keep telling you to go and watch Absolutely Fabulous, as you are firmly in this difficult demographic. But this demographic is taking power and I like the word difficult, as it implies complication. With more and more female politicians coming to the fore, it is possible to see their differences as well as their similarities. Women such as Nicola Sturgeon and Angela Merkel offer an unflappable authority and long-term strategy. Just after the Brexit vote, everywhere I went I heard people wishing that Sturgeon was our PM. She had the steady hand and the straight talk. As the political class crumbles and so much doubt and duplicity has been exposed, honesty is at a premium. Straight talk is necessary after the hyperbole of the referendum claims. Reality dawns as people who have never looked at charts of plunging stocks begin to connect things. Who will tell us what\u2019s what? For there is discomfort around women and power that is not just expressed by a loose-lipped grandee, but by a fundamental denial about the state of play. The Tories are about to give us a second female prime minister while much of the left will say gender is an irrelevance or that there are many more important things to deal with. Women, know your limits! There are always more important things to deal with. The unrepresentative nature of representative democracy is not top of the list right now. Instead we talk about \u201celites\u201d and we don\u2019t go into much detail. It was pretty boring to have to again point out the lack of female voices in the referendum discussion because for the past 10 years I have been complaining about the way women have been sidelined into being silent trophy wives in so much political coverage. We have gone backwards \u2013 and it\u2019s not just a conservative issue. The \u201csofa cabinet\u201d \u2013 that deadly clique around Blair that bonded over football and squabbling over which trousers Blair should wear \u2013 consciously or unconsciously kept women out of power. Yet the Tories manage to produce these potential leaders. May increasingly looks to be taking over the reins while Andrea Leadsom is a strong contender. Neither of these women is liberal, despite May\u2019s late conversion to gay marriage and Leadsom\u2019s concerns about mother/baby bonding. They are extremely rightwing and May has repeatedly used fear of immigration to ramp up her own leadership bid. The fact remains that Leadsom, with her overdeveloped CV, reluctance to publish her tax returns, the backing of Arron Banks and previous remarks on the total deregulation of small businesses so that workers might lose many of their rights, including maternity leave, is even worse. Both of these women present as Thatcher MK II. The right of their own party see Brexit as a way to enact the final stages of Thatcher\u2019s project \u2013 the corporate tax cuts were just the beginning \u2013 the aim being to turn us into a sunless Dubai. For this reason it is important to understand how Thatcher used her gender, instead of pretending it was irrelevant. Much left analysis at the time refused to acknowledge her incredibly skilled performances of femininity. May does not yet have her range. But her self-restraint will be attractive after the emotional excesses of the men. Being \u201cdifficult\u201d will be a boon in complex negotiations. Having lived through the Thatcher years I\u2019m afraid to say that her gender was never irrelevant in the way she exercised power. No, of course these women might not be feminists but they absolutely know how to run rings around patriarchal structures. If you don\u2019t understand something, you are doomed to repeat it. If you don\u2019t understand this ruthless combination of authoritarianism and stern femininity, it will be very difficult to challenge. But perhaps only difficult women now realise that.", "title": "Being a \u2018difficult\u2019 woman is good \u2013 but it can disguise a ruthless authoritarianism", "sentences": ["The right of their own party see Brexit as a way to enact the final stages of Thatcher\u2019s project \u2013 the corporate tax cuts were just the beginning \u2013 the aim being to turn us into a sunless Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-06T17:15:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/iraq-war-still-casts-a-long-shadow-over-a-dangerous-and-deeply-unstable-region", "tags": ["Iraq war inquiry", "Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "UK news", "Tony Blair", "Politics", "George Bush", "US news", "Iran", "Jordan", "Saddam Hussein", "Eid al-Adha", "Al-Qaida", "Syria", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Egypt", "MI6", "Saudi Arabia", "United Arab Emirates", "Israel", "Condoleezza Rice", "Hosni Mubarak", "Libya", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "France", "Bashar al-Assad", "Kurds", "Europe"], "article": "On 29 August 2003, a massive car bomb killed the Iraqi Shia cleric Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim in the holy city of Najaf, along with 85 others. The attack, four months after the US-led invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, was carried out by Sunni militants. The assassination echoed across a Middle East still in shock at the destruction of an Arab regime by western arms.

In February 2006, al-Qaida in Iraq, recently founded by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, blew up the golden-domed al-Askari mosque in Samarra. The wider target was the country\u2019s Shia majority, elated by the removal of the hated Sunni dictator. Next door, the Islamic Republic of Iran was celebrating the demise of its enemies \u2013 the Baathists of Baghdad and the Taliban in Kabul \u2013 courtesy of George Bush and Tony Blair.  And then, on 30 December 2006, Saddam was hanged. As he stood on the gallows, men in ski masks taunting him with Shia slogans, he denounced them contemptuously as \u201cPersian dwarves\u201d. Blurred video footage of his final moments was viewed by millions of Arabs \u2013 unleashing both fury and praise for his courage in the face of death. The timing, just as Sunnis were celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday, added insult to injury. The rest is not only history but the current reality of a dangerous and deeply unstable region.     Television footage shows masked executioners prepare to execute former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Photograph: HO/REUTERS     Now, as the British government faces intense public scrutiny from the Chilcot report, the war continues to cast a long shadow over Iraq, the Arab world and beyond. Even at the time, in the face of bitter controversy and mass protests, it was seen as a pivotal event. That judgment has been repeatedly confirmed by its toxic and destabilising legacy \u2013 the spread of hateful sectarianism, the growth of al-Qaida and then Isis, the empowerment of Iran: all were the unintended but undeniable consequences of 2003; all, like the latest carnage in Baghdad, are still making headlines today.   Related: Syria's civil war: five years of Guardian reporting    Arab and western analysts and historians are in broad agreement on these points. Hindsight naturally helps, though some spoke out at the time of the risks involved in the war \u2013 and were ignored. \u201cPeople did not think that al-Qaida and Iran would play the role that they did,\u201d Blair told the inquiry. Chilcot however, stated clearly on Wednesday: \u201cThe risks of internal strife in Iraq, active Iranian pursuit of its interests, regional instability, and al Qaida activity in Iraq, were each explicitly identified before the invasion.\u201d On another related issue, sometimes used to try to justify the invasion, few see any direct link between the fall of Saddam and the later uprisings of the Arab spring, which toppled four other dictators but left many in place, unscathed and more ruthless than before.  And, bringing a bleak story up to date, most experts argue too that the current crisis in Syria \u2013 the bloodiest of our times with 400,000 dead and millions made homeless \u2013 has been heavily, and negatively, influenced by the events of 2003 and after.  In the wake of the Iraq war, intervention became a dirty word, at least in the west \u2013 and arguably to calamitous effect. \u201cIt\u2019s the ghost of Iraq that stops Barack Obama intervening overtly in Syria,\u201d says Toby Dodge, of the London School of Economics.  Emile Hokayem, of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, agrees: \u201cIraq is seen by many as the original sin, and for understandable reasons. People read what they want into the tragedy. It is indeed a massive tragedy. It permeates everything, the way we talk about politics. It is pervasive.\u201d     Tunisians celebrate the first democratic elections following the Arab spring. Photograph: Anis Mili/REUTERS     Back then, the head of the Arab League, the Egyptian politician Amr Moussa, warned memorably that an invasion would \u201copen the gates of hell\u201d. Reservations like that were not out of love for Saddam \u2013 his \u201crepublic of fear\u201d was a byword for cruelty at home and aggression abroad \u2013 but out of anxiety about who, and what, would follow him.  For Hayder al-Khoei, an Iraqi-British academic, Saddam\u2019s domain was already \u201chell\u201d because of his brutal repression and the ravages of a decade of western sanctions. The weapons of mass destruction (WMD) issue was barely relevant. But the war meant, above all, the replacement of a Sunni regime by a Shia one. \u201cThat was an earthquake for the region, and the tremors and recriminations are continuing,\u201d he argues. \u201cAnd the fact that it was a cowboy from Texas who overturned a 100-year-old status quo was insulting. It was hard to stomach and psychologically difficult to deal with.\u201d  Gilbert Achcar, a Lebanese professor at SOAS, London University, sees the invasion as a direct continuation of the unfinished business of 1991, when Bush senior left Saddam in power to crush the Shia intifada that erupted in the wake of his ejection from Kuwait. The US intervention \u2013 what he succinctly calls Bush\u2019s \u201ccakewalk into an Iraqi quagmire\u201d \u2013 created the conditions for both the raw sectarianism and jihadi violence that followed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need a crystal ball,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt was very predictable and what happened was exactly what was predicted.\u201d  Aimen Dean, a Saudi who now works as a consultant in Dubai, has an unusual perspective \u2013 and rare inside knowledge. In 2003, he was an undercover agent for the British intelligence service MI6, having defected from al-Qaida as his doubts grew about its violent methods. \u201cIf Saddam is removed, a pillar of Arab nationalism will fall and it will only be replaced by Islamism on the Sunni or the Shia side,\u201d he cautioned his handlers.   Related: Why Isis fights | Martin Chulov     Events proved him right: after Saddam\u2019s hanging, Salafis in the Gulf donated millions of dollars to fund al-Qaida\u2019s war of bombings, beheadings and kidnappings against Shia \u201capostates\u201d. Luay al-Khatteeb, an Iraqi scholar at Columbia University, believes the Sunni autocracies preferred these terrorists to a Shia democracy imposed by American power. \u201cThe invasion was not only shock and awe for Iraq, but a wake-up call for the region,\u201d he has written. \u201cVirtually all of Iraq\u2019s neighbours provided shelter, support and in some cases finances and training to different insurgent groups. Iraqi Baathists were able to organise attacks from the safety of Amman and Damascus, while some Gulf states either tolerated or oversaw funding for Salafist-jihadist groups.\u201d But Abdelkhaleq Abdulla, a political scientist from the UAE, holds the US and UK primarily responsible for giving a deadly boost to the takfiri extremism embodied by the psychopathic Zarqawi \u2013 and to his successor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, emir of today\u2019s Islamic State (also known as Isis, or Daesh). \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for 2003, there would have been no Daesh,\u201d he insists. \u201cTo blame it exclusively on Saudi Arabia or Wahhabism is to dodge the issue.\u201d     The site of the car bomb attack by Islamic State at Karrada, Baghdad, on 2 July.

Assad\u2019s mukhabarat \u2013 secret police \u2013 sent Syrian extremists across the border to join the Iraqi resistance to the Americans. In 2011, he crushed initially peaceful protests and released jihadis from his prisons so they would militarise the uprising and make it easier to fight. Iran condemned the invasion but took advantage of its aftermath and gloated when Saddam was killed. \u201cIran was sucked into this conflict without wanting to get involved,\u201d insists Foad Izadi, of Tehran University. \u201cThe Americans carved out a role by playing on Sunni-Shia tensions. We did not benefit.\u201d Tehran\u2019s enemies watched apprehensively.  \u201cIran won twice, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq,\u201d recalls Sima Shein, at the time a senior official with Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency. \u201cThe moment Saddam was gone, the Shia came out on top and the Iranians won a strategic victory.\u201d   Related: What to expect from the Chilcot inquiry: revelation or whitewash?     The American architects of the war defended their vision, even after the catastrophic disbanding of the Iraqi army in May 2003 \u2013 widely seen as the greatest blunder of the post-war period. Neoconservative ideologues came up with a spurious \u201cdomino theory\u201d according to which regime change in Iraq would be emulated elsewhere and even somehow promote recognition of Israel by the Palestinians and moderate Arab states. \u201cBaghdad is for wimps, real men go to Tehran,\u201d went the (half)-jokey Washington saying.  In 2005, the US hailed regional changes it attributed in part to the removal of Saddam: one was the cedar revolution in Lebanon, where mass protests erupted after the assassination of former prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri, a Sunni with close Saudi links, and culminated when the Syrian army withdrew after a 30-year occupation.  Condoleeza Rice, Bush\u2019s secretary of state, talked up \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d that arm-twisted a reluctant Hosni Mubarak to hold parliamentary elections in Egypt, and even the Saudis to allow municipal polls. \u201cHow much credit went to Iraq, how much to the internal dynamics of each country and how much to luck depended on whom you asked and what position he or she wanted to justify,\u201d wrote George Packer in The Assassins\u2019 Gate, his fine study of US policy.     The Chilcot report will examine Tony Blair\u2019s role in the Iraq war, alongside US president George W Bush. Photograph: Stephen Jaffe/AFP/Getty Images    US claims, never convincing, have not stood the test of time. \u201cIt is utter bullshit in any way to link the Arab spring to Iraq as the neoconservatives do,\u201d says Dodge. \u201cWhat causal link could a quasi-imperial failed invasion of Iraq have to mass popular uprisings?\u201d Toppling Saddam\u2019s statue in Baghdad\u2019s Firdaus Square made for a great if stagey photo opportunity. Its fall may indeed have \u201cdemystified the power of dictatorships that had hitherto seemed eternal and unbreakable,\u201d in the words of Nadim Shehadi of Chatham House. But the changes that followed elsewhere were caused by more underlying factors, some of them also visible in Iran in the \u201cGreen\u201d protests that erupted after the \u201cstolen\u201d presidential election in 2009.  Iraq\u2019s turmoil continued to affect the wider region, and to be affected by it, even as attitudes to the occupation shifted. \u201cIn the early years you had strong anti-US resistance among the Sunnis but after 2006-7, with the civil war and defeat of al-Qaida, Sunnis came to see the Americans as the lesser evil to Iranian domination,\u201d notes Achcar.  The ultimate irony came in 2010 when Tariq Aziz, Saddam\u2019s veteran foreign minister, accused Obama in a Guardian interview from his prison cell of \u201cleaving Iraq to the wolves\u201d by pressing ahead with a withdrawal of US combat troops in the face of continuing instability.   Related: Isis will continue to kill in Iraq while there\u2019s a corrupt political class | Ranj Alaaldin     Libya\u2019s uprising, after those in Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain, stirred the ghosts of Iraq. Ordinary Libyans fought to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi while Nato\u2019s air campaign, driven by Britain and France while Obama \u201cled from behind\u201d, was coordinated with Arab Gulf allies who backed rival rebel groups. It fuelled another angry but inconclusive debate about how to respond to the Arab spring. The aftermath has not been kind to Obama\u2019s reputation or the credibility of US power in the Middle East. \u201cIn a way, the US-British invasion of Iraq was the unintentional catalyst for a lot of these regional transformations,\u201d argues Hokayem, who did not support the war but is a fierce critic of vacillating US responses to Syria compared to the strategic approach taken by Iran and Russia. \u201cThey would have probably occurred in one way or another as these weak, repressive and incompetent Arab governments were already there. But the invasion was an enabler. And there is a clear link between 2003 and the second age of jihadism and sectarianism. Westerners did not create these destructive phenomena but the invasion exacerbated them decisively. That\u2019s an important distinction.  \u201cPeople talk about the Iraq war the way they want to talk about it. There are a lot of self-serving arguments. The hypothetical scenario I and others are struggling with is this: let\u2019s imagine that tomorrow Assad survives in the same way Saddam survived in 1991. If there is then a semblance of internationally-accepted \u2018stability\u2019 in Damascus, would I, five years down the road, advocate another intervention in similar circumstances?

Newmarket\u2019s July meeting will offer a pleasing contrast to Epsom, Royal Ascot and Sandown\u2019s Eclipse meeting by providing actual good to firm for three days of quality racing, starting today.   Related: Horse racing tips: Thursday 7 July    Or at least we have been told to expect good to firm. I see the clerk of the course has actually had his watering can out to the extent of 5mm yesterday, which is a bit of a risk, given that there\u2019s some rain in the forecast for the next two days. Anyway, it should be fine today for A Momentofmadness (3.45) in the sprint handicap, for which he just doesn\u2019t want it soft. From four starts in handicaps this year, his only defeat was on heavy. Bred to be fast, this three-year-old is unbeaten in two since the hood was fitted and has finished strongly both times, suggesting this step up to six furlongs may actually help. He comes from the Charlie Hills yard that has a 19% record with three-year-old sprinters. Andrea Atzeni rides. What\u2019s not to like? He\u2019s 14-1, which seems big to me. I have my doubts about Prize Money, who heads the market for the opening Bahrain Trophy. He\u2019s a son of Authorized who has looked a bit ploddy and has shown his best form on soft ground, so it\u2019s no great feat of the imagination to foresee him getting outpaced by something on this faster surface, even though he steps up in trip. Perhaps Harbour Law (2.10) may be the way to go at 9-1. A winner at this distance on a fast surface at Sandown in May, he was beaten only by Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Sword Fighter in the Queen\u2019s Vase and that one has since bagged a Group Two. Silver Line (2.40) is another beaten horse from Ascot who could score here, in the July Stakes. The Godolphin colt missed the kick in the Norfolk and came from last place to be beaten just three parts of a length by two rivals whose energies had been used more evenly. The runner-up has won since, albeit at Listed level. At 6-1, Silver Line appeals because he suggests there could be significantly better to come. There is no doubting the quality of the form of Mehmas, the Coventry runner-up, but I\u2019m not sure he offers the same upside.

Related: Horse racing tips: Friday 8 July    It is hardly breaking news that the gap between good handicappers and Group-class performers is much smaller over sprint trips, and Richard Fahey\u2019s filly should looked ready to take the step up in class when she bolted up from a mark of 100 over this track and trip last month. Course form, in fact, is another point in her favour, as she produced a similar performance in a nursery on the Knavesmire last August, and while her form tailed off a little towards the end of her juvenile campaign, her seasonal debut four weeks ago was the best run of her career and recorded in a stong time. It is a match for anything on offer against her this afternoon and at around 100-30, she is an outstanding bet. Back at Newmarket, Nasimi (3.45) should take the Group Two which, for many of us, will always be the Cherry Hinton Stakes. Charlie Appleby\u2019s filly was very green on her debut but still recorded an impressive success, and can improve past Bletchley today. High Grounds (4.45) should also go well at a fair price on the Newmarket card, while at Ascot, Bess Of Hardwick (4.10) is the one to beat in the fillies\u2019 handicap. Luca Cumani\u2019s four-year-old has only two runs behind her and so does not have the experience of Peloponnese, her main rival in the market, but she showed enough in the maiden at Wolverhampton last October which concluded her three-year-old campaign to suggest that she will rise through the ranks this year. Masterpaver (3.35) has excellent prospects earlier on the card, while the time of Afandem\u2019s (3.00) latest run at Brighton suggests that he has the best chance at the weights in the nursery.

A big-field handicap winner at this meeting last year, he started his season with two Group successes but was beaten half a length last time in the Diamond Jubilee.

The prime minister is scheduled to visit the show on Monday, and assurances about Britain\u2019s future trading links with the rest of the world, including the European Union, are sure to be near the top of the agenda. The biennial aerospace jamboree is usually peppered with eyecatching orders for the latest jetliners, which provide a handy barometer of global economic confidence. Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic looks set to sign a $4.3bn deal to buy up to 12 A350 wide-bodied jets from Airbus, while the European plane maker\u2019s American rival, Boeing, will confirm an order for around 10 747 jumbo jets with Russia\u2019s largest air freight company, worth about $4bn. These marquee deals will be trumpeted loudly. But, after several years of bumper plane orders, analysts reckon the atmosphere among captains of the aero industry and their sales executives will be relatively muted as worries grow about the state of the global economy in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. One analyst said: \u201cA sudden ripple has gone through the market after Brexit. We\u2019ve got no idea about the impact of Brexit at the moment.\u201d Industry sources expect Branson to attend this week\u2019s show to sign the Airbus deal. It is thought Virgin wants to buy eight A350-1000 jetliners and take purchase options on a further four to replace its remaining Boeing 747s. Craig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, last month said that a decision on the new jets was \u201cimminent\u201d. The deal might enable Virgin to cancel its now-unwanted order for Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbo. Several other airlines are in the final stages of choosing between the A350 and its rival, Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner, including Emirates and Oman Air. European airlines are expected to have a quiet show. The uncertainty that has enveloped the EU since Britain voted to leave has already sparked profit warnings from British carriers such as easyJet and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways. In addition, a low oil price has not only eased the financial burden on carriers, but has also curbed their need to buy new fuel-efficient planes to replace ageing fleets.     A Boeing 787 Dreamliner belonging to the Polish airline LOT. Photograph: East News/REX Shutterstock    Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, has warned the EU vote was \u201ca lose-lose result\u201d for Britain and Europe. His view matters because Airbus makes all of its wings at Broughton in north Wales. \u201cBritain will suffer, but I\u2019m sure it will focus even more now on the competitiveness of its economy vis-a-vis the EU and the world at large,\u201d Enders said, warning: \u201cBut of course we will review our UK investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201d Airbus goes into this week\u2019s show lagging behind its arch-rival, after ending the first half of the year with 227 aircraft orders, or 183 after deducting cancellations. Boeing sold 309 aircraft, or 276 after cancellations. The figures clearly show demand for aircraft falling compared with the first half of last year, which included the Paris air show, held every other year in June. In 2015, Airbus booked 1,036 net commercial plane orders, down from 1,456 a year earlier, but it outsold Boeing, which booked 768 net orders last year. Boeing has lost ground to its European rival in the giant market for short-haul planes. There is talk that the US company is honing designs for a mid-range plane seating between 200 and 270 people to whisk passengers from London to New York, Sydney to Shanghai or Dubai to Oslo. The mid-market jetliner would fill the gap between Boeing\u2019s largest single-aisle model, the 737, and its smallest wide-body, the 787. It is a relatively untapped market but one where Airbus is starting to extend its reach. Mike Delaney, general manager of aircraft development at Boeing, recently said it was a case of \u201cwhen\u201d, not \u201cif\u201d, regarding the prospects for a new plane. He is confident Boeing is on the verge of a breakthrough, following discussions with 36 carriers about a replacement for the out-of-production 757.

The son of Dubawi won Ascot\u2019s midsummer championship after a stirring battle by a nose from Eagle Top for Luca Cumani 12 months ago but was subsequently transferred by his owner, Sheikh Mohammed Obaid Al Maktoum, to Varian\u2019s Newmarket yard. The master of Kremlin House could be described as a safe pair of hands having stepped into the breach when the hugely respected Michael Jarvis retired in 2011, forcing Varian to take the reins of the 124-horse string (it now numbers 180).   Related: Limato lifts Henry Candy by crushing rivals in Newmarket\u2019s July Cup    Jarvis was one of the most approachable top-flight trainers in the sport and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has not only maintained the level of excellence in the results on the racecourse but also in how he deals with the public and the media in particular. Varian\u2019s takeover was seamless and so has been his handling of Postponed who has won each of his three races impressively under his care. With less than two weeks until the King George Varian claims Postponed is \u201cexactly where I want him to be\u201d. \u201cPostponed is in great form and I am very happy with him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had an easy week after Epsom [when winning the Coronation Cup] as we had a little bit of a gap between then and Ascot. He seems as well as ever. We now just need two smooth weeks with him and I will be very happy.\u201d Postponed is the joint highest rated racehorse in Europe with a rating of 124, which suggests the handicapper believes he is a 6lb better horse than 12 months ago. It is hard to argue with that assessment as, since joining Varian, the handsome five-year-old has added two Group One races to his tally, including the Dubai Sheema Classic where he wiped the floor against the Japanese superstar Duramente. His most recent success at Epsom saw him stroll home four and a half lengths clear of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf heroine Found. Unlike many of his rival trainers, Varian will not be too bothered by the weather forecasts as his stable star has won major Group races on ground ranging from very soft through to good to firm. \u201cTo be honest ground is not a concern for him. I think he is probably a better horse on good to firm but I wouldn\u2019t be making any excuses on any other ground,\u201d the Newmarket trainer said. As to what makes Postponed the champion that he is, Varian added: \u201cHe has all the attributes of a great horse. He is remarkably versatile, has a great attitude and most importantly a huge engine. It doesn\u2019t matter if you run him over the undulations of Epsom or the Flat expanses of Meydan, he always does his job. \u201c The King George had lost a little of its attraction in recent years but with a superstar like Postponed making it the next stop of his campaign for global domination, it is a great result for Ascot and more importantly the standing of the race. Varian is a long-time fan of the event and admits he is thrilled at having the likely favourite. He said: \u201cAs a youngster getting into racing I used to love the King George watching greats like Lammtarra, Pentire and Swain [the last dual winner], and it was high on my wish list of races to win. Postponed\u2019s participation will certainly add lustre to one of the most important Flat races. But this is not a one-horse race by any means. He faces some seriously smart rivals and everyone knows it is never easy winning a race of this status.\u201d The Classic-winning trainer also has what he describes as \u201cthe top older miler in Europe\u201d in the guise of Belardo. His Dewhurst Stakes winner has already won the Group One Lockinge Stakes this season and was narrowly beaten by the highly rated American raider, Tepin, in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot. \u201cHe is also in great form and targets being considered are the Sussex Stakes [at Glorious Goodwood] or possibly the Prix Jacques Le Marois [at Deauville]. \u201cHe used to need soft ground but, as he has developed and matured, he has shown he can handle quicker ground, as he did so successfully at Newbury.\u201d The likeable Varian\u2019s career has been on an upward curve since he took out a licence in 2011 and it looks sure to continue in the ascendant as he and Postponed continue their association, which could ultimately lead to the Breeders\u2019 Cup at Santa Anita in November.", "title": "Roger Varian relaxed about Postponed\u2019s King George double bid at Ascot", "sentences": ["It is hard to argue with that assessment as, since joining Varian, the handsome five-year-old has added two Group One races to his tally, including the Dubai Sheema Classic where he wiped the floor against the Japanese superstar Duramente."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-10T17:55:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/12/liverpool-biennial-review-tate-rita-mcbride-lara-favaretto", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Tate Liverpool", "Sculpture", "Installation", "Video art", "Exhibitions", "Culture", "Liverpool", "Festivals"], "article": "Was there ever a biennial or a triennial, a Manifesta, Documenta or any other big art shindig that made total sense, whose art was at perfect pitch, whose catalogue was a joy, the theme transparent?

They now reside in Liverpool museums. Many of Blundell\u2019s amassed fragments were idiotically \u201crestored\u201d, melding objects of different eras and sexes, which is fun, but a kind of vandalism.

In a nearby corner Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian present a scratch video of footage showing Isis fanatics destroying monuments and smashing classical sculptures and statuary. You almost can\u2019t look, but at least it is only art \u2013 the trio have drawn over the footage with lumpen cartoon additions that turn the whole thing into clownish, bestial farce. There is glee in the destructive urge. It is almost infectious. This is the best and most dangerous work by the Iranian trio, who are altogether too omnipresent here. Now living in exile in Dubai, they sent all their work (as well as pieces from their collection, including photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, Mona Hatoum and Helen Chadwick) to Liverpool in a shipping container, and their sculptures and videos spread from Tate to the Open Eye gallery and to the big, abandoned bottling-plant hangar of Cains Brewery. I tire of all the makeshift figures and props which reappear in their videos, the pig-headed androgynes in wedding dresses, the spacemen in duct-tubing costumes wielding trombone-cum-orthopaedic crutch things, the cabbages and rubber gloves, the too-much-already of it all.

Photograph: Joel Fildes    Parallel and overlapping themes and conceits dog the latest Liverpool Biennial. You could get lost unpicking them. This may be the point. Rather than a single curator, the current biennial has a \u201ccuratorial faculty\u201d, which makes the whole thing sound like an academic symposium. A brainstorming exercise run amok, the biennial\u2019s themes are played out through a series of entangled episodes and heavily flagged curatorial rubrics, including Monuments from the Future, Flashbacks, Ancient Greece, Children\u2019s Episodes, Software, and Chinatown. In the midst of it all is a man walking forwards through traffic that\u2019s driving in reverse. This last is not a metaphor but one of a number of small, enigmatic films by the Malawian artist Samson Kambalu, shown both at Tate Liverpool and in the magnificent wreck of the ABC cinema. Kambalu judders on the screen, goes against the flow of the world at the street crossing, becomes a back-to-front flaneur.  Another of his films appears to be no more than a still of a small boy, low in his seat, an audience of one in an empty cinema, transfixed by the light on the screen, gleaming in his eye. I cannot tell you why Kambalu\u2019s seemingly inconsequential little videos fix themselves so memorably in the mind. If only the rest of the biennial were so strong, and shown in a less cluttered way. Showing the same artists in multiple venues does give the show a kind of continuity, but also makes it enervating. Oh no, you say, not this again. You have to fight to find the good stuff. On one of the boarded-up, ruined terraces in Toxteth stands a great block of granite. Rather than a mute lump of minimalism dumped in a deprived area, it stands between the houses as a monument to nothing, or a memorial to an abandoned community. You could read it as a gravestone, or a mark of resistance.

At the close of the biennial, the big cubic stone will be destroyed, and whatever funds have been deposited will be donated to Asylum Link Merseyside, a charity working with asylum-seekers and refugees. Favaretto has also purchased items of unclaimed luggage from left-luggage deposits, adding new stuff to the contents before locking them and throwing away the key.

Back to the future \u2026 a still from Dream English Kid by Mark Leckey Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Cabinet London    In the Oratory beside the Anglican cathedral, Lawrence Abu Hamdan screens a film set in a shooting gallery. This is apt. The film is a record of a trial over the shooting of Palestinians on the West Bank, and Hamdan, an audio analyst, discovered that the shots that killed the boys were not, as the defence suggested, accidental deaths by rubber bullets but the result of live ammunition. There are parallels between the bunker on the screen and the building where it is shown, the analysis of sound and the purpose of the oratory. It\u2019s a pity Jason Dodge\u2019s annoying rubbish has been allowed in, undermining the specificity and gravity of Hamdan\u2019s work.   Related: How Mark Leckey became the artist of the YouTube generation | Charlotte Higgins    The building where Mark Leckey was due to screen his new video Dream English Kid was destroyed by arson shortly before the biennial opened. Now relocated, Leckey\u2019s work is a journey into his own past, and has at its centre found amateur footage of a Liverpool gig by Joy Division, which the young Leckey attended. Dream English Kid takes us to a Liverpool destroyed by Thatcherism, with scenes of disaffected youth, wastelands, motorway bridges and pylons, and piss running down a man\u2019s trousers.  Brilliantly edited and filled with a kind of ambivalent anti-nostalgia, it is by turns moving, funny, ribald and stomach-churning. The sound is infectious and convulsive. Watching, I feel it is also prophetic, as though we were, like Samson Kambalu, walking backwards into a miserable, destitute future.            I last encountered the provocateur Michael Portnoy when I took part in an absurd live gameshow he hosted at Documenta 12. Portnoy\u2019s Relational Stalinism: The Musical at the Black-E is a stunning performance, as much theatre and parlour game as art. I never thought choreographed blinking or thumb-waggling could be so absurdly, pathetically affecting and hilarious. There are routines that parody choreographer Yvonne Rainer and take down Tino Sehgal, Philippe Parreno and Pierre Huyghe\u2019s collective Ann-Lee avatar, turning the homeless manga figure into a dysfunctional, resentful robot. Audience members who weren\u2019t paying due attention to Portnoy\u2019s bizarre language games got thrown out, and performers were humiliated by impossible demands. He seems to have a troubled, complicated relationship to art, other artists, the art world and the audience. This is healthy. It is cathartic. This is what we really need, not a faculty of curators.

Related: You can bet your bottom dollar that punters matter | Greg Wood    Johnston, a leading trainer for 25 years and also a former director of the British Horseracing Authority, told Tuesday\u2019s Racing Post that ITV should \u201cget rid of all coverage of betting\u201d when it takes over from Channel 4 as the sport\u2019s terrestrial broadcaster next year. If ITV fails to heed his warning, Johnston suggested, a \u201cTop Gear-style car crash\u201d could be on the way. The effect was like finding a dinosaur on the doorstep. The pace of change in racing has always been glacial but over the last few years the sport has, ever so slowly, been creeping towards a long-term settlement with the betting industry. Yet Johnston\u2019s comments imply there are still senior figures in racing who pretend betting is not an essential part of the whole \u2013 or perhaps even that racing could somehow survive without it. It is a nonsensical idea and no one at ITV is going to give it a moment\u2019s consideration. The broadcaster has not paid \u00a330m for a four-year monopoly on racing coverage because they think it is an interesting bauble that will look good gathering dust on the mantelpiece. They have paid \u00a330m because they expect to make a great deal more from exploiting the rights and by selling advertising slots to bookies in particular. There are, undoubtedly, terrestrial racing viewers who never place a bet but they are not the ones who add value to the rights. Ambulance-chasers, stairlift suppliers and the rest have no end of options when it comes to advertising their businesses. The best way for a bookmaker to reach racing punters, though, is to advertise during the TV coverage and they willingly pay a premium to do so.   Related: Ed Chamberlin, new face of ITV racing, grabs his \u2018second chance\u2019    It is that premium which lies behind the rise in the value of the rights from \u00a320m in 2012 to \u00a330m four years later, and ITV\u2019s decision to hire Ed Chamberlin as its main presenter next year also suggests betting will, quite rightly, be a key component in its coverage. Chamberlin, who started his media career as a PR with Ladbrokes, has a strong understanding of betting and appreciates its significance to racing as a whole. Even after nearly 30 years with a trainer\u2019s licence, however, it is a significance that Johnston still fails, or refuses, to grasp. To be fair, it may be difficult to see the bigger picture when you are lucky enough to run a business underpinned by sovereign wealth. Johnston has saddled 178 different horses in 2016 alone, and 64 \u2013 just over a third \u2013 are owned by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al-Maktoum, the son of Sheikh Mohammed and the crown prince of Dubai. But at the same time, Johnston surely spends enough time around racecourses to appreciate betting is an essential thread in the fabric of the sport. At the very least, the thought should cross his mind when he cashes his share of the winner\u2019s cheque for a race like the BetFred Mile at Goodwood, which Johnston has taken three times in the last seven years. Why does a hard-headed businessman like Fred Done sponsor a \u00a3150,000 handicap in the first place? Clue: it\u2019s not just because he wants people to like him. Racing has been bound up with betting from its earliest days and betting will be the key to its future prosperity \u2013 even if the dinosaurs who cannot or will not appreciate the fact are not yet completely extinct.", "title": "Mark Johnston on a loser suggesting ITV Racing ditches betting news | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["Johnston has saddled 178 different horses in 2016 alone, and 64 \u2013 just over a third \u2013 are owned by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al-Maktoum, the son of Sheikh Mohammed and the crown prince of Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-12T14:27:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/13/ron-arculli-red-verdon-ed-dunlop-grand-prix-de-paris", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Ron Arculli, the owner of Red Verdon, will hope that the third time is the charm when his colt lines up for the Grand Prix de Paris in its temporary home at Saint-Cloud racecourse on Thursday evening.

Related: Ed Dunlop ponders running Red Verdon in open-looking Derby    On the face of it Arculli\u2019s ambitious campaign with Red Verdon over the last couple of months has not been a roaring success.

Good runs to finish sixth and fourth recouped about \u00a360,000 but left the owner about \u00a3100,000 out of pocket. A punter would see it as a poor return on a gamble but Arculli and Ed Dunlop, Red Verdon\u2019s trainer, can see a bigger picture. Another \u20ac43,200, or about \u00a336,000, was required to get Red Verdon into the Grand Prix de Paris, one of the highlights of French racing\u2019s summer season, and success would not only recoup all the entry fees but turn Red Verdon into a highly valuable stallion prospect. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say but we felt he could have finished closer in the Derby and then we got too far back in the Irish Derby and he ran on very dramatically after the front two had gone,\u201d Dunlop said on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a last chance for him to take on his own age level in a Group One over a mile and a half and Ronnie Arculli is always up for something, as you can tell by the supplementaries. \u201cIt looks open, though Andr\u00e9 Fabre has three in there and we\u2019re playing on their doorstep but the horse is in good form.\u201d Red Verdon\u2019s colours are familiar to racegoers around the world thanks to the exploits of Arculli\u2019s remarkable stayer Red Cadeaux, who finished second in the Melbourne Cup three times, was the runner-up behind Animal Kingdom in the 2013 Dubai World Cup and won nearly \u00a35m in prize money during his long career. \u201cAt the beginning of his career Red Verdon was a breeze-up horse, so he couldn\u2019t be entered in the Derby [as a yearling],\u201d Dunlop said. \u201cHe was also rated 76 at the start of his three-year-old career, so he\u2019s made huge strides. We considered the [Group Three] Bahrain Trophy and the [Group Two] Princess of Wales\u2019s Stakes at the July meeting [last week] but Ronnie was very keen on this race and he\u2019s very ambitious. \u201cHe showed with Red Cadeaux that he\u2019s more right than not right. Of course, at the moment he hasn\u2019t got his money back but, if he\u2019d been a short-head closer in Ireland, he\u2019d have easily got his money back for that race. \u201cYou can look at it any way you like but every big race we turn to now seems to have supplementary entries and that is possibly typical of the way horses change and the way racing occurs with early-closing entries.\u201d Jean-Claude Rouget\u2019s Mekhtaal, who finished only eighth from a difficult draw after starting second-favourite for last month\u2019s Prix du Jockey Club [French Derby] is the narrow market leader for Thursday\u2019s race while Fabre\u2019s team for a race he has won 13 times already includes Cloth Of Stars, who finished eighth in the Derby at Epsom. Fabre also runs Maniaco, a lightly raced son of Galileo out of a Group One winning mare, who has had only two races to date but is clearly well-regarded by his trainer.

It was important for our growth ambitions to make inroads into this geography before other competitors beat us to it and got too much of a stranglehold on the market.\u201d  Rather than expanding slowly, the company blitzed the new market, launching in every US state at once in December 2013. \u201cOffering a subscription service, it would have been against our ethos to impose restrictions on delivery and eligibility, and would have also been hard to reconcile with our online marketing campaigns and social media presence, which know no barriers,\u201d says Fletcher. \u201cThe dream for us was jumping in feet first.\u201d  The strategy paid off: within 24 hours, Graze had a customer in every state; within three weeks 30,000 orders had been placed and by three months it had gained 100,000 customers.     Graze launched in every US state at once in December 2013.     With water sports enthusiasts across the world landing on its website, e-tailer Wetsuit Outlet felt compelled to start selling overseas. \u201cWe were getting people emailing us and approaching us to buy wetsuits from us across the world and lots of traffic worldwide was landing on the site,\u201d says director Ian Homan. \u201cWe\u2019ve had orders from bizarre locations like Sierra Leone. I think it helped because we\u2019re a niche retailer with few competitors\u201d.  Most of the site\u2019s traffic comes via organic search. \u201cAs our website is solely for water sports and nothing else, it means we have a really high prominence on Google,\u201d says Homan. Wetsuit Outlet started running paid search across Europe 18 months ago to coincide with the launch of dedicated country sites in France, Germany, Italy and Spain and has seen an increase in sales on the back of the investment. Today, a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of its business stems from overseas, with the e-tailer shipping to 60 countries.  Investing in digital marketing has helped galvanise overseas sales for furniture e-tailer Made.com, which has a presence in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.     Made.com\u2019s showroom in Paris.     \u201cDigital is essential in helping our business internationally,\u201d says Annabel Kilner, commercial director at Made.com, which sees around a third of its revenues come from outside the UK. \u201cWe can target a specific audience \u2013 we know what our audience looks like in the UK and we can buy a similar audience in other markets. For a business like ours that is focusing on fast growth, we very much look at ROI [return on investment] and digital is trackable.\u201d  When Made.com launched in France in 2013 the company invested in display advertising to build brand awareness but Kilner says the company\u2019s digital marketing tactics overseas are now more focused on a combination of paid search, paid social, Google Shopping and retargeting.  However, while there are obvious gains to be made from expanding overseas, there are challenges ahead, not least because of Brexit. On the back of Brits voting to leave the European Union, financial markets plunged into freefall and a cloud of uncertainty now hangs over both the economy and consumers. British companies are now expected to approach international expansion with a higher degree of caution or delay striking new deals and getting into bed with their European neighbours until the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU becomes clearer. Brexit aside, companies have flagged up other hurdles when considering taking the plunge and expanding overseas. According to a survey by Santander and research firm Dods, over two-fifths (44%) of SMEs said determining where the best opportunities are is the key challenge they face when trying to develop in new markets overseas. This was followed by concerns over currency fluctuations (38%) and lack of local knowledge (29%). Wetsuit Outlet\u2019s Homan reels off several challenges to selling overseas, including the cost of fulfilment. \u201cIn the UK you can send a parcel for \u00a35 but it may cost up to \u00a325 if you\u2019re sending to an island in Greece. You always want to deliver quickly to a customer so you might want to pick air rather than road and that hits margins. We do swallow most of the costs and we\u2019re happy to do that as we want our niche to grow and develop further.\u201d  He also says there are issues surrounding dealing with queries in foreign languages. \u201cWe do use Google Translate but we have placed investment in hiring multi-lingual support staff.\u201d    Understanding the risks, and testing the market to overcome them\u200b,\u200b is key to ensuring you land on your feet.  Anthony Fletcher, Graze      Kilner advises companies to thoroughly research any potential new markets and weigh up the pros and cons. \u201cWe chose France because three of the founders are French and knew the market,\u201d she explains. \u201cPlus it\u2019s only three hours away door to door. The ease of getting there easily was important to us. Whilst we have a team on the ground in the UK running the company, we use local agencies for support so it\u2019s important to have a good relationship and meet face to face.\u201d  Digital communications agency Cult LDN co-founder Cat Turner says brands plotting international expansion should start early with their local strategy. \u201cTease out the launch of your brand or product in advance. Also, involve local influencers and work with key players to introduce your brand through respected third-party endorsement.\u201d  Be warned, expanding overseas can be massively complex and it\u2019s not for the fainthearted. \u201cThink about if it\u2019s worth it,\u201d says Homan. \u201cIt is for us as we\u2019re in a niche. If you\u2019re not in a niche and you\u2019ve got to compete with some big players, then it could be hard. It\u2019s a big investment but there are other easier ways, such as selling through eBay and Amazon, which could provide a stepping stone.\u201d  There\u2019s no universal right or wrong way to go international, says Fletcher. \u201cWhether you commit to setting up local infrastructure, or run operations purely from the UK, the process is still the same. It\u2019s still a huge leap, and understanding the risks and testing the market to overcome them, is key to ensuring you land on your feet.\u201d   With strong confidence in your international business plan, it could be a risk worth taking.

The addressee was the archaeologist Beatrice de Cardi, who has died aged 102. She was, said the artists Fari Bradley and Chris Weaver, \u201cthe one woman who changed the way the world viewed UAE and other Gulf countries entirely in terms of archaeology\u201d. De Cardi\u2019s fieldwork circled the Gulf, starting in Baluchistan in 1947, moving in the 60s to Iran and the Arab Emirates, and on to Oman and Qatar in the 70s. When she stopped digging \u2013 unable to climb in and out of trenches, she said \u2013 she continued cataloguing artefacts at the Ras al-Khaimah emirate\u2019s national museum, whose foundation went back to her pioneering discoveries. Her most pleasing find was a type of pottery used in Ras al-Khaimah in 2000BC, which analysis showed to have been imported from where she began, in Baluchistan. Although this work was impressive, and supported by grants from academic institutions, she was technically an amateur, accumulating leave to fit her travels around paid employment. She distinguished herself equally in the latter as head of the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) for 24 years, but her heart was in the Middle East. \u201cShe toiled valiantly for British archaeology,\u201d said a friend, \u201cwhile dreaming of deserts.\u201d De Cardi would advise young, aspirant archaeologists that the career was best followed with private means. But if, she once told me, you have to choose between a comfortable living and a perennial interest in life, \u201cpersonally I\u2019d plump for the interest\u201d. She was born in London to Christine (nee Wurrflein), a singer and heiress from Pennsylvania, and Edwin de Cardi, a Corsican count. Beatrice was the last of an aristocratic line from Bastia, Corsica. She loved visiting relatives there and searching for ancient sites in the maquis; she requested a Corsican liberation song for her funeral. She grew up in a large house on Ealing Common with a tennis court and servants, learning ballet at a barre installed at home while her mother bought waffles at Selfridges. As a child touring in the family\u2019s Belsize car, she would ask to stop at archaeological sites; her father shared her interest. Illness interrupted her education at St Paul\u2019s girls\u2019 school, and she gave up dancing. After convalescing, she studied history and economics at University College London. It was Mortimer Wheeler, an adventuring archaeologist whose lectures De Cardi attended while at UCL, who enthused her to choose the subject for her life\u2019s work. Her first experience of excavation was at the great fort of Maiden Castle in Dorset, where, she observed, Wheeler \u201chad the foresight to get the general public interested\u201d while his wife, Tessa, taught the team. In 1936 De Cardi became his secretary at the London Museum, and they remained good friends until his death. She joined the allied supplies executive of the war cabinet in China in 1944, travelling around India and China as personal assistant to the British representative. After the war, finding her museum post filled, she became assistant UK trade commissioner in India, lured by the prospect of studying the ancient Indus civilisation. After partition, she opted for Pakistan. Wheeler was there. Failing to convince her of the dangers of remote Baluchistan, he arranged an assistant for her, an illiterate farmer named Sadar Din. From him, she said, she learned more than from any academic source, referring to his understanding of the landscape. Soon even De Cardi recognised Baluchistan as unsafe; it was more than a decade before she would return to her \u201carchaeological paradise\u201d. In 1949 she was invited to join the new CBA, running a small office in a South Kensington attic. Her mission was to combine local archaeological societies into a federal campaigning force, as postwar renewal threatened substantial damage to historic remains. Under her direction, the CBA set up research committees \u2013 including one for industrial archaeology, a world first \u2013 and published reports and guides. It grew into a key player in British archaeology, representing especially enthusiasts. De Cardi\u2019s tact and efficiency were well known. \u201cShe wrote the best chairman\u2019s agendas I have ever seen,\u201d said a colleague, \u201call likely pitfalls carefully outlined.\u201d She was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1950, and became its vice-president and then director. She was appointed OBE, and awarded the al-Qasimi medal for archaeological services to Ras al-Khaimah, the Royal Asiatic Society\u2019s Burton memorial medal, a fellowship and visiting professorship at UCL, and a senior fellowship at the British Academy. The day after her retirement in 1973, she was in Qatar, commissioned by the government to uncover the country\u2019s story \u201cfrom the stone age to the oil age\u201d in 10 weeks. On this expedition George Barrington (Barry), her interpreter and driver, died after a riding accident. \u201cThe debt I owe him is immeasurable,\u201d she wrote of a man she said she would have married, \u201cand my personal loss was overwhelming.\u201d An earlier fiance had died in the second world war. On her 100th birthday, the CBA, which has held an annual Beatrice de Cardi lecture since 1976, named its offices Beatrice de Cardi House, and the Society of Antiquaries presented her with its gold medal, one of archaeology\u2019s highest accolades. \u2022 Beatrice Eileen de Cardi, archaeologist, born 5 June 1914; died 5 July 2016", "title": "Beatrice de Cardi obituary", "sentences": ["Art Dubai, a fair in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), last year commissioned a performance featuring a monologue to \u201cBeatrice\u201d."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-14T12:39:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/17/open-champion-henrik-stenson-dedicates-victory-mike-gerbich", "tags": ["The Open 2016", "Henrik Stenson", "Phil Mickelson", "European Tour", "PGA Tour", "Golf", "The Open", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "Henrik Stenson spoke of the inner belief that he would win the 145th Open Championship, with the Swede dedicating the Claret Jug to a late friend after claiming his first major in stunning fashion. On an extraordinary Sunday, Stenson carded a record-equalling major round of 63 to take the Open by three shots from Phil Mickelson. During his victory speech, Stenson paid tribute to Mike Gerbich, who passed away in Arizona. The pair had become friends when Stenson lived in Dubai.

Mike, this one\u2019s for you.\u201d Later, Stenson said: \u201cHe was one of the real good guys back in Dubai. I\u2019d known him for many, many years, and he was a very keen golfer and a great man. \u201cI had news on Tuesday that the end was near and unfortunately he passed away on Wednesday morning over in the US. So he\u2019s always been there as a big supporter of mine. In good days and bad days he always sent me messages and been out at some events. This one is dedicated to him, for sure.\u201d Stenson\u2019s four-round aggregate of 264 is a major record in its own right. The 40-year-old has thereby become Sweden\u2019s first major championship winner. \u201cI felt like it was my time,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee it by any means and I had to play some great golf to get there but I believed in myself and did a great job out there. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you run around and shout about but I felt this was my turn. I knew I was going to have to battle back if it wasn\u2019t but I think the extra self-belief made me go all the way this week. \u201cIt makes it even better that I beat a competitor like Phil. He is one of the best ever to play this game. \u201cI feel very privileged to be the one with this trophy. So many great Swedish players have tried and there have been so many close calls. This is going to be massive for golf in Sweden.\u201d Stenson will rise to No5 when the world rankings are published on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re only just getting started, aren\u2019t we?\u201d he said with a smile when asked as to what achievements may come next. \u201cYou never know once you open the floodgates what might happen. It\u2019s going to be a while to have all of this sink in. \u201cWe have a big schedule to get through this summer, with the US PGA Championship and the Olympics to come.\u201d Mickelson now has 11 runners-up placings in major tournaments, alongside five victories. His 17-under-par total would have been sufficient for at least a play-off spot in 141 of the 145 Opens played throughout history.

It is around eight months since Aaron Cresswell last visited the Olympic Stadium and now, seeing the club\u2019s livery dotted around for the first time, there is an early chance to feel at home. Cresswell has been promoting this season\u2019s kit \u2013 some things are more of a novelty than others \u2013 and is evidently engaged by his surroundings, pausing at one point to admire the community pitch that sits adjacent to the stands. A rare balmy evening glows with possibility; it must feel as if the left-back has returned to a different, bigger club. \u201cYeah, it does and it\u2019s a really exciting time to be here,\u201d the 26-year-old says. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to get started. We\u2019ve got the new stadium, a new training ground [at Rush Green] going up and the chairman\u2019s backing the manager. We\u2019re bringing good players in; we saw how well Dimitri Payet, Manuel Lanzini and the others did last season and now we want to kick on again.\u201d   Related: West Ham and Leicester in contention for Toulouse\u2019s Wissam Ben Yedder    So far the close season has brought four major signings and two of them, G\u00f6khan T\u00f6re and Ashley Fletcher, made their introductions to Cresswell just minutes before he paraded the shirt. Change has been constant recently and all of it positive; last month Cresswell proposed to Jessica, now his fianc\u00e9e, in Dubai and the pair continued their celebrations in the Maldives. It was doubtless a happier place to be than England\u2019s Euro 2016 base in France and there were plenty who felt that, even with the national team\u2019s surfeit of options in his position, Cresswell should have spent his summer at Euro 2016. The smile, when this is raised, suggests it is far from the first time the thought and question have occurred but the answer gives little away. \u201cIt was frustrating watching as a fan. It was hard because you want them to progress and do well,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a young squad and I\u2019m sure there are good times ahead. Of course I\u2019d want [to represent my country] one day and I\u2019m hoping it happens but the focus for me is on West Ham. All I can do is play at my best here.\u201d The opportunity may arise sooner than he expects. Should Sam Allardyce be named England manager it would be no surprise to see Cresswell, whom the then West Ham manager signed from Ipswich Town two years ago and has spoken of in glowing terms since, named in his first squad. Feelings between the two run both ways; the player is sure Allardyce, at Sunderland now, would be ideally suited to the role. \u201cI\u2019ve a lot to credit him for,\u201d Cresswell says. \u201cHe brought me to the club and I can\u2019t speak any more highly of the year I worked under him. He was fantastic with me personally and, if you ask any of the other boys, they\u2019ll say the same thing. His man-management skills were very good, top drawer, so I think, if he does get the job, he\u2019ll do very well. It\u2019s a good fit for England and we\u2019ll see if he gets it. He had a fantastic coaching staff with him; you\u2019d work on your weaknesses every day, trying to progress and improve as a player, and that\u2019s what I think I did.\u201d That process continued last season under Slaven Bilic, who has been linked with England himself in rather more speculative terms, and Cresswell has seen other areas of his game develop. West Ham\u2019s more fluid approach was well documented and it certainly did little harm to Cresswell, whose forward combinations resemble peak-era Leighton Baines and whose left foot produced four assists. \u201cHe\u2019s been fantastic ever since he walked through the door,\u201d he says of Bilic. \u201cThe style is a bit different. Maybe it\u2019s a European thing that he brought into us, wanting us to move the ball and pass it more, with a bit more movement. For 90% of the games last season Dimi [Payet] played in front of me and that made it seem easy; when you\u2019re making that overlap you know the ball\u2019s going to come to you, or that something will be made of your run. When everything clicks together for us, it looks good.\u201d They should be clicking for some time yet. Payet signed a new contract in February and Cresswell, in another forward step during this summer of advancement, has just agreed a one-year extension. Both deals run to 2021 and both men may, in the first instance, be tasked with hauling West Ham through the third qualifying round of the Europa League. Shakhtyor Soligorsk, of Belarus, or the Slovenian side Domzale may not hold great allure as a curtain-raiser for West Ham\u2019s new life but needs must and lessons have been learned from last year\u2019s defeat by Astra Giurgiu. \u201cLast season not many of us had played in the Europa League and it was definitely an experience travelling to Andorra, Malta and Romania, under difficult circumstances as well,\u201d he says. \u201cThis season we\u2019re starting slightly later and we\u2019re ready to try and go as far as we can.\u201d They will be well supported in their new home and, although May\u2019s rollercoaster of a final game at Upton Park, a 3-2 win over Manchester United, was \u201csomething that will live with me for the rest of my life\u201d, the next step for West Ham and Cresswell will justify the means. \u201cTo play in front of 60,000 people week in, week out, in the Europa League and Premier League \u2013 it\u2019s something you dream of,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we just hit the ground running now.\u201d     Aaron Cresswell, seen here in West Ham\u2019s 2016-17 home kit, is looking forward to playing in front of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium.

Perry Baker, the lanky \u201cSpeed Stick\u201d from Daytona Beach, Florida, was among them.    Related: NFL player Nate Ebner selected for US Olympic rugby sevens squad    An email from coach Mike Friday confirmed Baker had achieved the goal he set when taking up rugby full-time three years ago and had since worked brutally hard to meet, traveling the world with the USA team and training like crazy at the Olympic centre near San Diego. For the next two days, though, he had to keep the news to himself. It wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cI was so overwhelmed with joy,\u201d he said on Monday, still on the delighted side of ecstatic. \u201cThis was the reason I chose to play rugby, to play in the Olympics.\u201d Baker grew up with football, shone in college and signed for the Philadelphia Eagles as a wide receiver. Injury meant his NFL dreams slipped away. He played arena football, then picked up the other kind of oval ball and set his sights on the Games. He is a crossover athlete, a species longed for in US rugby and feared round the rest of the world. His try-scoring success, though \u2013 he was the only American selected for the 2016 HSBC Sevens World Series Dream Team \u2013 has been of a greater order than many other former football players. \u201cI played football all my life so I was always working hard to be something and be successful at what I was trying to do,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when I decided to play rugby I gave it my all, because I never knew what rugby was, I had to learn the game. It wasn\u2019t like I took it up at 18. It feels good to be at this point now.\u201d Baker, now 30, was speaking on a morning of interviews on behalf of a sponsor, the Milk Life campaign \u2013 not the kind of thing many American rugby players have done before. But the Olympics are just over two weeks away and the Olympians are known: at least until men\u2019s final day in Rio, 11 August, the men and women of the US sevens squads will be under the spotlight as never, ever before. \u201cIt\u2019s been all morning, all interviews, but I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI\u2019m having a blast of a time now, just soaking it all up. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be a part of Milk Life on this journey here. The way that we train, we need the nutrition \u2013 I need to help my body break it down and refuel, and I get that from milk. I get my protein, I get my essential nutrients that my body needs because the training that we do is real hard. So I\u2019m honoured to be part of Milk Life.\u201d Drink milk, kids, and you too could play rugby at the Olympics \u2013 if not in Tokyo in 2020 then at four-yearly gatherings to follow, presuming the sport stays in favour. American success in Rio and a boost for ratings in the States would help. The US men and women both finished sixth on the World Series just gone; both are drawn to face leading teams, Fiji for the men and Australia for the women, in the first round in Rio. But such is the closeness of elite sevens competition, both squads have genuine medal hopes. It is time for final preparations: honing the extreme fitness required, strengthening the bonds that will matter most in the lung-burning torture of a gold medal game.    I\u2019ve been visualizing it so much \u2013 the big moments, standing on the podium, putting a gold medal on our necks  Perry Baker     \u201cWe have a couple of days off to get ourselves together after six long weeks of work,\u201d Baker says. \u201cOn 26 July we go down to Florida for a scrimmage with the New Zealand All Blacks, and then 5 August we leave for Rio. Kick-off is the ninth, we play on the 10th, the 11th. \u201cI\u2019ve been visualizing it so much \u2013 the big moments, things happening, standing on the podium, putting a gold medal on our necks. If every one of us is thinking like that then anything can happen.\u201d The consensus is that gold would be huge for the American game as a whole, which now has a nascent professional league, Pro Rugby, and, under the former All Blacks coach John Mitchell, burgeoning ambition in 15-a-side internationals. It\u2019s a big chance for those who will go to Rio \u2013 and it means big pressure, too. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to enjoy the attention,\u201d Baker says, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to not let it take you off course \u2013 you\u2019ve got to stay focused. If you think about it, all the success we\u2019ve had came from the team. We beat New Zealand for the first time, we won in London. It\u2019s just team success all over, I\u2019m just having fun doing it in the team.\u201d Nate Ebner is now part of that effort. The New England Patriots special teams player took a leave of absence from the NFL to pursue an Olympic place in the sport in which he grew up, succeeding where the likes of Jarryd Hayne (Fiji), Quade Cooper (Australia), Bryan Habana (South Africa) and Liam Messam (New Zealand) did not. Predictably, much US press attention has focused on Ebner\u2019s unlikely journey. \u201cI\u2019m glad he came when he did,\u201d Baker says of Ebner, who played two World Series events this year. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t wait till 13 June to come when the Olympic camp started for us. I\u2019m glad he came earlier to be on the circuit with us, because of the chemistry we have. We\u2019ve been together for three years, all of these guys have, and it\u2019s great for Nate to come in. \u201cHe knows what it\u2019s about, he\u2019s a Super Bowl champion and it\u2019s just great to have him aboard. He\u2019s worked really hard to be where he is, he hasn\u2019t stopped yet, he keeps walking the line and he\u2019s been a leader since he was here.\u201d         Perry Baker scores four tries against New Zealand at the London Sevens in May.

He came in to win and to make us be the best we can be. That\u2019s why he drives us so hard. He always reminds us: \u2018Guys, I\u2019m going to push you and I\u2019m going to drag you, because you guys deserve that.\u2019 When you have a coach like that you\u2019ll just run through a wall for him.\u201d In Florida, scrimmaging with the mighty All Blacks, Friday, Baker and the 11 other Olympian men will put their final foundations in place.

The Queen has won the race named in honour of her parents only once, in 1954, and will hope to bridge a 62-year gap just weeks after celebrating her 90th birthday. Dartmouth, the winner of the Group Two Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot last month, was the second-favourite at around 6-1 after he was added to the field at a cost of \u00a375,000 on Monday, behind Postponed, a 1-2 chance to win the race for the second year running.   Related: Dartmouth entry for Queen in King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes    The shape of the race was transformed in a moment when Roger Varian, Postponed\u2019s trainer, revealed on his website that the five-year-old had failed to show his usual sparkle on the gallops.  The King George was first run in 1951, a year before the Queen\u2019s accession, and the monarch took the fourth running of the race with Aureole, who was bred by her father. Aureole had finished second in the 1953 Derby behind Pinza, who took the King George the same year. The closest the Queen has come to a second success in the race was in 1974 when Highclere, successful in the 1,000 Guineas and French Oaks earlier in the season, finished second to the outstanding Dahlia. In what is now a very open renewal of Ascot\u2019s midsummer showpiece, Dartmouth is top-priced at 9-4 to give Sir Michael Stoute, his trainer, a record-breaking sixth success in the race, while Highland Reel, who finished just a head behind him when second in the Hardwicke, is an 11-4 chance to reverse the form. Wings Of Desire, the Dante winner at York in May and the only three-year-old with a credible chance, is 9-2, while Erupt, fifth home in last year\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, is 5-1 and it is 20-1 bar the four. \u201cUp until this point, Postponed had not given us any worry during his training regime,\u201d Varian, who took over the training of Postponed last autumn, said on Wednesday morning. \u201cHowever, we felt Postponed did not work with his usual zest [on Wednesday morning] and a subsequent scope showed he is suffering from a respiratory infection.\u00a0 \u201cThis news is very disappointing and it is a real shame for Sheikh Mohammed Obaid [Postponed\u2019s owner], the team and the racing public that he will not line up on Saturday.

England do not suddenly possess a bad team but were beaten in a superb Test at Lord\u2019s by a side who ultimately played better and deserved their success. There is no shame in that. Test matches though come tumbling one upon another so the day cannot be long off when another match starts while the previous one is still in progress. Is it a figment of the imagination that recalls a player taking the field at Lord\u2019s in a Test and The Oval in a county match on the same day? So, scarcely has a victory been celebrated by one team than the opportunity for redemption, revenge, a \u201cchance to silence the critics\u201d\u2013 call it what you will \u2013 comes readily to the vanquished. England will be strengthened by the return of Jimmy Anderson and Ben Stokes, both of whom ought to have been playing in the first Test. Water under the bridge now. Anderson will replace Jake Ball and Stokes \u2026 well, we shall see.   Related: Yasir Shah spins Pakistan to win in first Test as England collapse at Lord\u2019s    Fingers would have been pointed at Steven Finn as the obvious one to make way, given Chris Woakes has made himself indispensable. Now that Finn and Jake Ball have been jettisoned it would seem to leave a straight choice between the usual balance of three seamers, plus Stokes\u2019s all-round skills, and a single spinner; or the dropping of a batsman. History tells us very little about what to expect. The teams have met in Manchester on five occasions, going back to 1954, so there is not much there. In 2001, Pakistan overran England in the final session just as Australia arrived here having heard about the new fighting unit that was the host team. In the time it took them to get from their hotel to an official reception England lost half their wickets to Waz \u2018n\u2019 Waqar and Saqlain Mushtaq, who coincidentally has been advising the England spinners these past few days. Five years later, on a Peter Marron special, the boot was on the other foot, with Steve Harmison and Monty Panesar sharing 19 of 20 Pakistan wickets (the other was a run out), England winning by an innings. Since then, the pitch has been rotated through 90 degrees, new stands built, the prevailing wind comes from a different angle and the wicket is said to have lost its teeth. It is the opinion here that England will not beat Pakistan with spin. Any comparison between Yasir Shah, who is deemed the world\u2019s leading Test-match bowler, and England\u2019s spinners is a fatuous one. When the teams met in the UAE last winter Yasir and Shoaib Malik took 26 wickets at 21.5 and 20.7 respectively. For England Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid managed 17 between them at, respectively, 48.6 and 69.5. The attack was held together by the brilliance of Anderson and Stuart Broad, together with Mark Wood and Stokes.   Related: Ben Stokes fit and ready to lead England recovery against Pakistan    Rashid\u2019s five wickets in the second innings of the first Test in Abu Dhabi, the first such haul for an England wrist spinner since Tommy Greenhough more than half a century earlier, is viewed by some as reason to include him now. Pakistan batsmen figured him out pretty quickly thereafter. England failed at Lord\u2019s largely because the top-order batting could not cope against three excellent left-arm pacemen and Yasir\u2019s wrist spin, with reliance too heavily placed on Alastair Cook, Joe Root and Bairstow. It should be no more incumbent on the lower order to keep bailing the batsmen out than it would be to expect Root and Vince to take a hatful of wickets. England could, if they were minded, decide Vince offers style but no sense of permanence, and as a starting point recognise Stokes as a superior Test batsman, capable of batting at five. Gary Ballance, who at least has a gameplan, could move up to four, and Bairstow at six (he is capable of five although keeping as well would prove physically and mentally draining). England could then have played all of their four seamers, including Finn, who for all the brickbats thrown at him bowled a brilliant final spell at Lord\u2019s. Playing him when not at his best and discarding him now when he is seems an absurd thing to do: historically he takes wickets at a faster rate than anyone in the team.   Related: England captain and coach overruled on Jimmy Anderson\u2019s fitness for Test    What is likely to happen is that the strategy will stay the same, with only the tweak to the personnel. It means Moeen retains his place, as he should. From Lord\u2019s he will be remembered for the manner of his second-innings departure but he was the victim of a dreadful lbw decision in the first innings and could do little about the manner in which Misbah-ul-Haq sliced and diced him when he bowled: it was brilliant batting rather than poor bowling. The alternative is Rashid, who is a terrific white-ball cricketer, aided by the imperative, particularly in T20, to try to get after him, with fielders out. There is time in Tests to wait for the bad ball and put it away, a low-risk but productive strategy against someone who is slightly slower than optimum. Incidentally the reckless second-ball yahoo that saw him dismissed in the first innings of the second Test in Dubai cancels out that of Moeen: one-all on the slog front. It would help the England cause if Misbah could call incorrectly. There have been six Tests between the sides since England last won the toss, seven since England last won a match and 11 since they last won both toss and match.

It ends in a mess \u2013 manager Brian Talbot and Allardyce both sacked in January 1991 after a red-faced 4\u20132 FA Cup defeat to Isthmian League side Woking. But Allardyce\u2019s self-belief isn\u2019t shaken: he moves to Bury as a part-time coach, before being handed his first big management chance in Ireland. June 1991  Allardyce is unveiled by Limerick. It\u2019s an eye-catching season: he leads them straight to the second-tier title, and earns a coaching job back in England with Preston. Ten games later he becomes Preston\u2019s caretaker manager when Lee Chapman is sacked \u2013 but misses out on the full-time job to John Beck. He\u2019s then tasked with instilling Beck\u2019s brand of long-ball football in the youth team instead. He later details the experience in his autobiography: \u201cIt was ludicrous \u2026 I told the lads they had to do what the manager wanted, and placate the parents who threatened to take their sons to other clubs. It was hard defending the indefensible. I was in the dressing room telling them: \u2018Target those corners, hook it on when you\u2019ve got your back to goal.\u2019 How did I feel? Shit.\u201d     On the bench in February 1992 as his Limerick team take on Cobh Ramblers.

He takes them to 12th in his first season and third a year later \u2013 but chairman Owen Oyston, in jail at the time, responds to play-off defeat by sacking him. Allardyce later accuses Oyston of a \u201ccold, calculated, pre-planned\u201d decision \u2013 but says the experience taught him a lesson. \u201cWhen Oyston sacked me I didn\u2019t have a contract \u2013 he said I never ever needed one while I was with him. I swore that day I would never carry on without a properly written, formulated contract.\u201d     Issuing instructions to his Blackpool charges as they take on Swindon Town in April 1996. Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock    January 1997  And \u2013 after a spell as academy director for Peter Reid\u2019s Sunderland \u2013 he gets one: hired by Notts County to end their crisis. He fails to stop them falling into Division Three via an 18-game winless run \u2013 but then takes them to a spectacular promotion as champions the following season, finishing on 99 points using a solid system built on a three-man defence. But after regular rows over funds, and with a sniff of the Bolton job, he phones in his resignation in October 1999. \u201cI told them: \u2018I can\u2019t work for you any more, I\u2019ve packed my bags and gone back to Bolton. I\u2019ve had enough of all the stuff you\u2019ve done to me. Thanks for the opportunity. Bye.\u2019\u201d October 1999  Back at Bolton he replaces Colin Todd, who resigned in protest at the cash-raising sale of Per Frandsen. Among his first big decisions: selling Todd\u2019s son, Andy, after the defender breaks assistant manager Phil Brown\u2019s jaw during a team-bonding session. Allardyce then leads them on a stirring run \u2013 taking Bolton from the bottom half to play-off defeat to Ipswich, and FA Cup and League Cup semis. He blames the play-off defeat on referee Barry Knight, calling his performance \u201cbordering on criminal, the worst refereeing performance in the history of football. Barry Knight lost it, completely lost it.\u201d     Looking dejected after the 5-3 play-off defeat to Ipswich Town in May 2000.

They then power on into the new season, starting with a 5-0 win at Leicester, securing a total of nine points from the first three games, and, after a rough patch, beating Manchester United. Critical pundits are unconvinced by it all \u2013 Mark Lawrenson pledges to shave his moustache off if they stay up \u2013 but January signings Stig Tofting, Fredi Bobic and Youri Djorkaeff help defy the odds and secure 16th place. Lawrenson gets his razor out. February 2004  A personal landmark moment. Having avoided relegation again in 2002-03, the following season \u2013 with a side now featuring Kevin Davies and Emerson Thome \u2013 Bolton reach the League Cup final, Allardyce\u2019s first final as a player or manager. It ends badly, though: a 2-1 defeat to Middlesbrough, with Allardyce blaming referee Mike Riley for not giving them a late penalty. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked him as a ref for us. He cost us the chance of winning. We had our concerns about him before the match, and he lived up to them as far as we were concerned. Our fans showed their feelings when they booed him as he went up for his medal.\u201d The season ends with a much-improved eighth-place finish.

After securing a Uefa Cup spot the previous season with a sixth-place finish, Bolton reach the last 32 \u2013 but are beaten by Marseille. Allardyce, repeatedly linked with Newcastle, then makes a four-man shortlist for the vacant England job, alongside Alan Curbishley, Steve McClaren and Martin O\u2019Neill. \u201cSteve looks slightly ahead of me in the running,\u201d says Allardyce, \u201cbut who knows?

May 2007  After a setback \u2013 the Manchester City chance disappearing when Thaksin Shinawatra buys the club \u2013 Allardyce makes his long-rumoured move to Newcastle. He spends heavily \u2013 incoming deals including Joey Barton, Mark Viduka and Alan Smith \u2013 and they start with a win over his old club Bolton. But form fades and, after 24 games, it\u2019s over. Newcastle call his exit \u201cmutual consent\u201d, Allardyce calls it \u201ca shock\u201d. He adds: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it. But you can\u2019t be bitter, you just have to move on. Me and my wife will get away in the sunshine, have a little bit of a break and then come back and refocus. When will the next job come?

His first game in charge is a 3-0 win over Stoke, kicking off a nine-game unbeaten run. On the way to securing safety Allardyce takes the plaudits, but reflects on his lot. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be mentioned at all now would it, Sam Allardyce for the England job? But at the time I should have got it. Maybe my external look isn\u2019t to everybody\u2019s liking and one or two seem to dislike Sam Allardyce \u2013 but it was the right time and the right job for me.

It wouldn\u2019t be a problem to me.\u201d Later in the season he lays into Danny Murphy for calling his Blackburn side dirty. \u201cPeople like Danny Murphy are giving a perception that isn\u2019t true.

Alex Ferguson calls the decision \u201cstupid, ridiculous, deary me\u201d. Allardyce heads south for relegated West Ham instead. He reassures Hammers fans that he\u2019ll play \u201cattractive football\u201d, then embarks on a massive overhaul, with 25 players leaving and 19 arriving. Criticism of the playing style builds, but results are strong, and they go up, via the play-offs.     The Blackburn fans show their appreciation of Allardyce. Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA Archive    May 2012 Feeling vindicated, Allardyce reflects on that problem again: too much perception in football. \u201cIt rankles with me at times that I have to remind people what I\u2019ve done. If you start talking about it too much, you just get labelled big-headed, people go: \u2018He\u2019s blowing his own trumpet again\u2019, but if no one else is going to talk about it, you have to talk about it. The lingering long-ball shit, the old style, all that rubbish \u2013 that\u2019s never been me and never been a part of what I am.\u201d He then invests heavily again in 11 new arrivals including Andy Carroll on loan, before returning to the theme. \u201cI won\u2019t ever be going to a top-four club because I\u2019m not called Allardici.\u201d West Ham finish 10th, and Allardyce signs a new two-year deal.

Mourinho calls West Ham\u2019s style \u201cfootball from the 19th century\u201d; Allardyce responds: \u201cHe just can\u2019t take it. He just can\u2019t take it. I knew he would say that. He can tell me that all he wants, I don\u2019t give a shite. He can\u2019t take it that we\u2019ve out-tactic-ed him and outwitted him. He just can\u2019t cope. I love to see Chelsea players moaning at the referee, trying to intimidate the officials, and Jos\u00e9 jumping up and down. It\u2019s great to see.\u201d April 2014 Days after picking up the Premier League manager of the month award for a run of four wins and one draw, Allardyce sees West Ham fans stage a protest against his style of play during an away game at West Brom \u2013 a banner reading: \u201cFat Sam Out, killing WHU\u201d. A month later, fans take a \u201cFat Sam Out\u201d banner to co-chairman David Sullivan\u2019s Essex mansion. The club respond by backing him, and hiring attacking coach Teddy Sheringham to \u201censure the team provides more entertainment\u201d.     Reacting to boos from West Ham fans in 2014.

Getting the ball in the opposition\u2019s box quickly with quality is sometimes the best way.\u201d A month later he assesses his standing in the game: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any coach more sophisticated than me any more. I\u2019m just as good as everybody at this stage.\u201d But, despite some praise for an improved style and another manager of the month award in April, Allardyce leaves on the final day of the season. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual.\u201d West Ham finish 12th. October 2015  It frees him up for one more challenge: saving Sunderland after Dick Advocaat\u2019s exit. In his second game they beat Newcastle 3-0 \u2013 but are seven points from safety at the turn of the year. He attracts controversy in February while denying Jermain Defoe elbowed Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, saying foreign players \u201cmake a big fuss of it. That\u2019s in their nature.

Although he has not made the running in his last two starts, he has done so in the past and might easily be granted a soft-lead in this small field, which lacks an obvious pace-setter. Fast-ground middle-distance races like this are made for Highland Reel, as he proved in landing the Gordon Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, the Secretariat Stakes in the US and the Hong Kong Vase last year. This year has not been so fruitful. He probably needed his Dubai reappearance and then ran miles below form in Hong Kong in April for some reason.   Related: Dartmouth right on course for King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes    You could worry about his apparent unwillingness to battle with Dartmouth at Royal Ascot but, after further review, I\u2019m inclined to see the positives. That was a return to something like his best and he would probably have won, had Seamie Heffernan not dropped his whip a furlong out. Given the way Dartmouth carried him across the track, that must count as a game effort and he was just starting to put his head down and go forward as the line arrived. However this race pans out, he must be fancied to turn that form around, especially with Ryan Moore returning to the saddle. Wings Of Desire is respected in receipt of 12lb but could do with a strong early pace, which seems unlikely. The French raider Erupt is worth plenty of respect, despite his year-long losing run. 2.45 Ascot The Princess Margaret could provide Frankel with his first Group-race success as a sire, through Fair Eva. The daughter of top-class sprinter African Rose, she was most impressive on her Haydock debut and ought to have made a bit of progress since that debut in early June. 3.00 York A different horse this year and three times a winner from four starts, Swift Approval seems to have been turned around by cheekpieces. Entered in Group Ones as a juvenile, he is now making good on the early promise he showed and a 4lb hike for his Silver Bunbury Cup success may not be enough to halt his run. 3.20 Ascot With seven wins at a 30% strike-rate in the past fortnight, Hughie Morrison is in blazing form and his Pirouette could extend her unbeaten record for the year to three. She travelled smoothly and quickened well at Doncaster last time and a 5lb rise underestimates her. A couple of her siblings were rated a fair bit higher than the mark she has here. 3.35 York He will be long odds-on but it is hard to see past Time Test, since he is Group One class on fast ground at this distance but meets lesser rivals at level weights.

Related: Prince Harry and Elton John urge redoubling of efforts against HIV/Aids    The blessers phenomenon, which began in the richer suburbs of Johannesburg, 100km away from this little town of Temba, is seen as a major threat to South Africa\u2019s poorest girls by experts who blame the culture for a rise in HIV infections. At 7 million, the country already has the highest number of people in the world living with HIV. \u201cA lot of young women growing up in poor single-mother households in rural areas are prey to all the social ills,\u201d said Phinah Kodisang. \u201cThe common thread of young women here is that they want to find a way out of poverty.\u201d Kodisang is from SoulCity, which runs 1,000 Rise clubs, groups to help girls navigate the obstacles littering their lives and which are supported by the government, and the Global Fund, which was set up to fight Aids. \u201cThe girls are constantly preyed on, they look up to an older man who makes promises,\u201d Kodisang said with some bitterness. \u201cSome of them come into the villages when school is coming out and pick on a pretty girl who is barefoot; they know she has no money. \u201cUnfortunately, none of them are offering school uniform or school fees. They are offering cheap shoes or nice hair to a girl who would love something to make her feel special.\u201d Generally married, always older, blessers are men who use their money to control young women. The term has become so entrenched that there are four \u201clevels\u201d of blesser: at the lowest level the man offers mobile phone data cards and visits to drinking clubs. Then there\u2019s gifts or much-coveted hair extensions. At the highest levels phones, cars and trips abroad are offered. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, director of the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research, told last week\u2019s International Aids Conference in Durban that intergenerational sex, led by blessers, was driving HIV infection rates. The centre looked at how the HIV virus was being spread in KwaZulu-Natal \u2013 a province badly hit by the epidemic. \u201cMore than three out of every five young women acquired HIV from a man in his 30s,\u201d said Karim.     Members of regional RISE Clubs perform in scenes to raise awareness of the dangers of \u2018blessers\u2019 in their area. Photograph: Jonx Pillemer/(RED)    Not quite prostitution, not quite sugar daddy, sometimes paedophilia, the blessers culture has taken off on social media but also in schools. And the power dynamics make it difficult for young women to demand safe sex. In Temba, the Rise girls moved their seats into a circle to talk about how they can resist. Vaientia, 15, said she and her friend were locked in a classroom by a teacher. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let us out until my friend gave him her phone number. She said no but eventually she gave him the wrong one. He was angry and confronted her and she had to give him her real one. Then he was ringing all the time, morning, noon and night and saying dirty things to her. You can\u2019t tell anybody. Who can you tell? Maybe he will give you bad marks.\u201d Vaientia took matters into her own hands. \u201cI went to the teacher and I told him that if he wasn\u2019t stopping this then me, myself, I will go and find someone who will beat him.\u201d Asked who among them had been approached sexually by a teacher, arms shoot up and the young women start jostling to tell their experiences. \u201cI didn\u2019t report it, I just ignored him. There are no people to report to and he would kill me,\u201d said Lerato. \u201cSome teachers say, \u2018I will give you high marks\u2019,\u201d said Lindiwe Baloyi. \u201cI had a teacher who wanted to take me to lunch and have sex.\u201dSome schools do try to tackle the issue said Glory, 14: \u201cIn my school we had two teachers like this. One impregnated a girl and one girl was raped. Those teachers were thrown out of school. School talk to us now about how blessers work.\u201d In a country where sex has become a transaction between the poor and the richer, the young and the older, every week around 2,000 women aged 15 to 24 contract HIV. They are now the largest at-risk group, with those aged 15 to 19 up to eight times more likely to be HIV positive than boys. The Rise young women learn about HIV and the benefits of education, in a place where the odds are stacked against them. Rates of rape and domestic violence are higher than those of unemployment (running at 26%) and school drop-outs. Back-street abortions kill and damage dozens every year. Rudo, an 18-year-old from Randfontein, said she let her parents think she worked as a beautician, to explain her elegant nails and braided hair. \u201cMy first blesser just gave me clothes, but I left school because he would call me to him in the daytime and beat me if I didn\u2019t go. This one is number four blesser and a better level than before. I don\u2019t worry about safe sex because I know he is only married and me. But I think the schoolgirls should be protected from blessers.\u201d South Africa\u2019s health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, last month announced a campaign to raise opportunities for young women and tackle \u201cthe men who are infecting and impregnating them\u201d., saying those from poorer backgrounds were most at risk of being exploited by blessers. At the launch, during which deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa chanted: \u201cDown with blessers! Down with sugar daddies!\u201d, the government promised to \u201cwean\u201d women away from blessers.     Young women of the \u201cFamous Divas\u201d Rise Club in Temba.

Nelly Shamase, a writer for the Mail &amp; Guardian, said Johannesburg\u2019s northern suburbs were now \u201cblesser central\u201d. \u201cThe two decades since the advent of democracy have seen a steady mushrooming of nouveaux riches in the black community. Political connections and better opportunities have monetarily emancipated a number of black men. And what\u2019s one of the things that some of these men like to do? Bless their women with shopping sprees, overseas trips, pampering sessions. \u201cCertain educated women of all ages hop on the blesser train and move in blesser circles where the blessed socialise and compare lifestyles.A joke doing the rounds is that blessers are the main reason why the air route to Dubai and back is so profitable \u2013 everybody knows that blessers love to spoil their women with trips to the United Arab Emirates.\u201d But, for Temba girls, blessers offer simpler things. \u201cFor the poor communities, it\u2019s a mobile phone, a pair of jeans, a hairstyle. It\u2019s difficult when they are offered things they don\u2019t have, and the admiration of a richer man in his flashy car,\u201d said Kodisang. \u201cBut no ability to demand safe sex.\u201d As the Aids conference ended on Friday, Unaids chief Michel Sidib\u00e9 said: \u201cTo the blessers, there is only one level I want: zero level, zero tolerance for men who put adolescent girls at risk.\u201d", "title": "Village girls fight scourge of the \u2018blessers\u2019 \u2013 whose gifts ruin their lives", "sentences": ["\u201cCertain educated women of all ages hop on the blesser train and move in blesser circles where the blessed socialise and compare lifestyles.A joke doing the rounds is that blessers are the main reason why the air route to Dubai and back is so profitable \u2013 everybody knows that blessers love to spoil their women with trips to the United Arab Emirates.\u201d But, for Temba girls, blessers offer simpler things."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-23T23:04:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/24/glorious-goodwood-godolphin-vintage-aidan-brien-war-decree-boynton-isomer-horse-racing", "tags": ["Glorious Goodwood", "Godolphin", "Aidan O'Brien", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": " The Coolmore and Godolphin empires have their first major confrontation of this season\u2019s Glorious Goodwood when War Decree and Boynton are the market leaders in the Vintage Stakes on the first day of the festival on Tuesday. Qatar, another Turf gal\u00e1ctico, sponsors the Group Two Vintage for two-year-olds and has lifted the prize for the winner to more than \u00a3113,000 but the contest between the two colts means far more than money to the Tipperary and Dubai-controlled operations, between whom there is a fierce rivalry. Ten runners have been declared for the seven-furlong race, the Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained War Decree being quoted at around 15-8 favourite, with Godolphin\u2019s Boynton next at 5-2. Boynton, saddled by Charlie Appleby, beat War Decree by three-quarters of a length when the pair met in the Superlative Stakes at Newmarket earlier this month. Most bookmakers believe the O\u2019Brien colt will gain his revenge this time because Boynton, to be ridden by James Doyle, must now concede 3lb to all his rivals and has an outside draw \u2013 while Ryan Moore\u2019s mount has the favoured stall against the inside rail. Godolphin also run the Saeed bin Suroor-trained Thunder Snow, who was sixth in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. Richard Hannon\u2019s Larchmont Lad, a Sandown maiden winner, is third in the betting. But perhaps the biggest threat to the big two will come from Isomer, trained by Andrew Balding. \u201cHe is very relaxed, a big rangy, lovely colt,\u201d Balding said on Sunday. \u201cHe will probably need to compete over further than seven furlongs but he is clearly up to this class.\u201d Isomer, to be ridden by Jamie Spencer and priced at up to 12-1, won a maiden at Salisbury last time out but had previously been a fast-finishing runner-up in the Chesham at Royal Ascot \u2013 won by O\u2019Brien\u2019s Churchill. Back in third place was Cunco who, incidentally, later finished fourth in the Superlative.   Related: Godolphin badly want results from huge squad at Royal Ascot    Since the Vintage Stakes was elevated to Group Two status 13 years ago its prestige has soared, with several victors going on to win one of the following year\u2019s Classics. Galileo Gold took the Vintage last year. The two previous winners were Highland Reel and Toormore (2013). Galileo Gold, this year\u2019s 2,000 Guineas and St James\u2019s Palace winner, trained by Hugo Palmer, is favourite for Glorious Goodwood\u2019s main event, the Sussex Stakes on Wednesday. O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Gurkha is close behind in the betting while Godolphin\u2019s main hope is Toormore, rated an outsider by the bookmakers. The Lambourn trainer Clive Cox must be hoping this summer never ends as, having sent out two Group One winners at Royal Ascot last month, across the Channel on Sunday he plundered the Group Two Prix Robert Papin. The former jumps jockey has assembled his best ever team and the future looks even more promising after Tis Marvellous bolted up in the Maisons-Laffitte feature race. Adam Kirby had the two-year-old quickly out of the stalls and they disputed the lead until two furlongs out when the colt quickened away in the style of a top-class sprinter. Cox won the 2012 running of the Robert Papin with Reckless Abandon, who went on to prove himself a Group One campaigner. Next month\u2019s Prix Morny at Deauville would now have to be under serious consideration for Tis Marvellous. \u201cHe handled the step into Group company with aplomb,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt was a pretty special display.

Shahid\u2019s local MP, Naz Shah, has demanded that authorities in Pakistan exhume her body and commission an independent autopsy.  The police officer leading the investigation in Pakistan told the Guardian he had sent samples from the body to the country\u2019s top forensics lab in Lahore on Tuesday.  Mohammad Aqeel Abbas, the station house officer for Jhelum district who is investigating the case, said a postmortem was carried out immediately after Shahid died and she was then buried in her village graveyard. There were no visible injuries or signs of violence on her body, he said.     Samia Shahid with Syed Mukhtar Kazam. She was described as a happy and bubbly person. Photograph: Supplied by Syed Mukhtar Kazam    Shahid\u2019s husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, claimed he was told the \u201chappy and bubbly\u201d 28-year-old had suffered a fatal heart attack. He received the news last week while in Dubai, where the couple lived together.  A source close to the family told the Guardian they believed she died after an asthma attack. Her husband said he feared she had been killed by her family, who he says refused to accept their relationship, partly as he was an \u201coutsider\u201d. Shortly before Shahid and Kazam married at Leeds town hall in September 2014, she had left her first husband, a first cousin from their village in Pakistan. The family strongly deny Kazam\u2019s claims. Her father, who is in Pakistan, said the allegations made by Kazam were \u201clies and allegations\u201d against him. \u201cAn investigation is under way and if I am found guilty I am ready for every kind of punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy daughter was living a very peaceful and happy life.

Photograph: Supplied by Syed Mukhtar Kazam    A family friend in Bradford said on Sunday the family were not happy when Shahid married Kazam but had learned to accept their relationship because they loved her.  The Guardian has seen a witness statement submitted to Pakistani police by Shahid\u2019s father, Mohammed Shahid, in which he refers to his daughter\u2019s husband as her cousin Mohammed Shakeel, not Kazam. The Guardian has also seen a copy of Shahid and Kazam\u2019s British marriage certificate, signed on 24 September 2014. Shah has asked the prime minister of Pakistan to intervene. In a letter written on Sunday to Nawaz Sharif, seen by the Guardian, Shah wrote: \u201cShould this be [an honour killing] case then we must ensure justice is done for Samia and we must ensure this never happens again.\u201d A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed Shahid\u2019s death, saying: \u201cWe are providing support to the family of a British national who has died in Pakistan, and are in contact with the local authorities to seek further information.\u201d A West Yorkshire police spokesman confirmed the force was aware of the death and would liaise with the Foreign Office and Pakistani authorities. Kazam, a Pakistani national, claims Shahid\u2019s family did not approve of their \u201clove marriage\u201d. He says she moved to live with him in Dubai in May 2015, but had been back to Bradford twice in the past year to persuade her parents to accept the relationship. Kazam claimed that at the start of July, Shahid was encouraged to travel to Pakistan because one of her aunts had died, but she chose not to travel to the country. Kazam claimed Shahid was told that a relative was gravely ill in Pakistan and she flew to Islamabad on 14 July. Shahid was due to return last Thursday but Kazam said he received a call on Wednesday from one of Shahid\u2019s cousins saying she had had a heart attack and died. He told the Guardian he did not believe his otherwise healthy wife would have died suddenly, and he flew to Pakistan to force the police to investigate.

And she had no disease,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe she was killed because her parents were not happy with our marriage.\u201d In Bradford, where the family live in a large end-terrace house in the Manningham area, family friends said they were shocked by Kazam\u2019s allegations. One woman, who did not want her name to be published, said she had known Shahid all her life. \u201cShe was happy and bubbly, loud and very much loved by her family.\u201d Shahid had worked as a mobile beauty therapist but in Dubai had been working in an office for a property company, she said.

Samia Shahid, 28, who died in uncertain circumstances in Pakistan last Wednesday, had returned to Bradford in September to try to patch things up with members of her family who were unhappy she had married an \u201coutsider\u201d from a different Islamic sect, friends said.  Shahid had been living in Dubai with her second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, having divorced her first, a cousin from the family village in Pakistani Punjab. A friend, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian that Shahid returned from Dubai in September to try to build bridges with her family. She was optimistic about the visit, posting on Facebook that she was excited about returning to her \u201cmotherland\u201d.  She asked a female police officer to chaperone her to the family home in Manningham, Bradford, after being harassed by one of her relatives, who wanted her to return to her first marriage. A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said on Tuesday: \u201cPolice can confirm that they attended an address in Bradford last September, where the victim was subjected to harassment. The offender received a warning and the victim was informed of the action taken. \u201cWest Yorkshire police is continuing to liaise with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in relation to the death in Pakistan.\u201d Police would not confirm which family member received the harassment warning. The MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah, has demanded Shahid\u2019s body be exhumed and an independent postmortem carried out. Shahid\u2019s family have told the Guardian she died from either an asthma attack or a heart attack, but her second husband alleges foul play, believing she was the victim of an \u201chonour\u201d killing. An initial postmortem was inconclusive, Pakistani police told the Guardian. Her internal organs have been sent to Lahore for forensic analysis, Mohammad Aqeel said. There were no visible injuries or signs of violence on her body, the officer added. The Guardian has seen a witness statement submitted to Pakistani police by Shahid\u2019s father, Mohammed Shahid, in which he refers to his daughter\u2019s husband as her cousin Mohammed Shakeel, not Kazam. Shahid\u2019s father maintains his innocence. Reached by phone in Pakistan on Tuesday, he said: \u201cI loved my daughter. She was my everything. I\u2019m still in grief. I\u2019ve no idea; maybe police have issued warning to my family members but this hasn\u2019t come in my notice. My family members as well as she didn\u2019t inform me. My daughter never complained to me if she had any problems within the family.\u201d Three of Shahid\u2019s friends in Britain spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity about her relationship with her family in Bradford. One had already given a witness statement to West Yorkshire police and the others said they would do so imminently. One woman, who asked to be named as Annie Shah, said she became close friends with Shahid in the run-up to her second wedding, when she was converting from being a Sunni to a Shia, a different denomination of Islam followed by Kazam.  Some of Shahid\u2019s family were very unhappy about the conversion, which meant she attended a different mosque. Annie Shah said: \u201cThey didn\u2019t like that he was not only not part of the family but also wasn\u2019t a Sunni.\u201d Annie Shah said she had first known Shahid when she was still unhappily married to her cousin, Mohammed Shakeel, and living in Pakistan. \u201cShe asked my sister-in-law to help her get contraceptive pills because she didn\u2019t want to get pregnant,\u201d she said. She said Shahid was very happy with Kazam, whom she called Ali, and was trying to get pregnant when she died. \u201cShe loved her husband so much. She was madly in love with him.\u201d Another friend, who said she had known Shahid for six years in Bradford, remembered the incident last September when Shahid returned home chaperoned by a police officer. \u201cThey had kicked her out of the house so she came back with a woman police officer.\u201d The family strongly deny Kazam\u2019s claims that he feared she had been killed by her family. Her father said the allegations made by Kazam were \u201clies and allegations\u201d against him. \u201cAn investigation is under way and if I am found guilty I am ready for every kind of punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy daughter was living a very peaceful and happy life. She had come to Pakistan on her own and was not under any pressure from her family.\u201d \u201cThis is a terrible tragedy but she died of natural causes,\u201d said Mohammed Ali, a cousin in Bradford. \u201cThe family did a postmortem.

She notices a guy she took algebra with in high school a few steps ahead of her, hanging out with a group of his own friends. She doesn\u2019t call out, because she knows he won\u2019t recognise her. She is wearing her abaya, her hair covered, and the guy from algebra is a US serviceman on his day off. The classroom they sat in together is more than 7,000 miles away in the Pacific Northwest.

Photograph: Aparna Jayakumar    I meet the 32-year-old Qatari-American artist in a windowless room a few floors up from the exhibition space. This is her first solo show in the US, the high point so far of an artistic career that has encompassed science fiction, sculpture and film-making. (She has a day job as a screenwriter for TV, \u201cbecause video art does not pay\u201d.) Today Al-Maria is just off the plane from London, and speaks with the slightly stoned drawl of the jetlagged. \u201cThis may be the worst interview ever,\u201d she warns me. But she is nothing if not used to air travel. Her upbringing involved \u201cping-ponging\u201d between her mother\u2019s home town in Washington state and her Bedouin father\u2019s native Qatar. Unsurprisingly, she never quite felt she belonged in either place, an experience that forms the basis of her 2012 memoir The Girl Who Fell to Earth. You might assume that it would involve tales of being catapulted from the liberal west into a land of traditional values and narrow horizons. Far from it. \u201cI would go to the Gulf and feel that I was part of the world,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI would listen to pop music on the radio that I didn\u2019t hear in the States, I would have access to technology, to video games, to pirated films, to Indian and Chinese and European stuff. I felt very much that that was where I wanted to be, and when I came back to the States, it was like the same TLC song being played on repeat.\u201d    In the Gulf \u200bI'd have access to Indian, Chinese, European stuff. In the US, it was the same TLC song on repeat    It is that turbocharged, frenetic Middle East, where everyone is glued to their jawwal, or mobile phone, with which Al-Maria has become identified. If you read about her, you\u2019ll find out that she coined the phrase \u201cGulf futurism\u201d a tag that invokes the space-age towers of entrep\u00f4ts like Dubai and their hyper-connected thobe-wearing inhabitants. But when she brings it up, it\u2019s with an eye-roll. \u201cI reserve the right to disavow every work and everything that I\u2019ve ever said because oftentimes, even six months later, I\u2019m like: that was stupid. That\u2019s a little bit how I feel about that term, because it has been taken to mean some kind of aesthetic, when, in fact, what I was talking about was a sort of time travel.\u201d In other words, the vertigo-inducing changes that have transformed the lives of family members who otherwise \u201cstill keep goats and still make cheese in an inside-out sack\u201d.

For the rest of the summer, visitors to the Whitney will be greeted by a juddering, malevolent din emanating from a room just off the main lobby. These are the sounds of Black Friday and its companion piece, Litany, 113 separate videos displayed on mobile devices strewn across a bed of sand at the foot of the main screen. Every so often the noise is interrupted by the voice of Sam Neill, who declares, among other things: \u201cThis is where the glamorous heart of evil is born. And reborn. Not in the dark satanic mills of the 19th century but the bright fluorescent malls of the 21st.\u201d We see extraordinary distorted images of marble halls, mannequins lit with psychedelic colours, empty escalators running ad infinitum. It\u2019s at once sumptuous and extremely disturbing.  \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare sermon,\u201d Al-Maria explains. \u201cLike a bad trip, basically.\u201d Much of it was filmed using a drone, at a yet-to-open mall in Doha. A veiled woman wanders this vacant paradise, presumably after everyone else has been spirited away by the apocalypse. At the end, she lies prone on the beautiful polished floor, dead from luxury.

A bad trip'    Insofar as religion and hijab crop up in Al-Maria\u2019s work they\u2019re relatively unobtrusive. The abaya is simply what women wear in Qatar, and when she\u2019s there, Al-Maria does too. There\u2019s no polemic about the clash of civilisations \u2013 which isn\u2019t to say that people\u2019s ideas about how Islam relates to the west don\u2019t get foisted on her work. For instance, she found herself at the centre of a media storm in New Zealand after her film For Your Eyes Only, which depicts a group of Qatari women getting ready for a wedding, was shown at a gallery near Wellington. \u201cIt was in a side-room where only women and young children were allowed to go, the same way that there would be that sort of safe space at a wedding in the Gulf,\u201d she says.      A still from Sophia Al-Maria\u2019s video work Litany. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist    But the exclusion of men from a taxpayer-funded gallery sparked a heated debate. The piece was labelled \u201cinflammatory and provocative\u201d. Al-Maria points out that there was no outcry when Marina Abramovi\u0107 staged a talk from which men were excluded at London\u2019s Meltdown festival in 2012. The difference, I point out, is Islam. Lots of people hate Islam. \u201cThey\u2019re titillated, let\u2019s face it,\u201d she responds. \u201cThey hate it and they\u2019re titillated. That\u2019s the gross thing, the thing that must be defused.\u201d   Related: Women film-makers dominate Jarman award shortlist for 2016    I ask her to elaborate, though she\u2019s reluctant. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big conversation to go into. How long have you got? I\u2019m not sure that I want to step into that minefield right now. But I have lot to say about it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Still, she furnishes me with an example. When The Girl Who Fell to Earth was being prepared for publication, she went to the designers with a kind of presentation to help show them what to avoid. \u201cIt was basically every ridiculous cover of a woman in a veil, Hijabs and Thongs, Hijabs and Snogging or whatever \u2026 it was giving them a sort of context in which to understand: don\u2019t do this to me. Because this is not what this book is. It\u2019s going to be on an airport shelf, great, but I don\u2019t want someone to be attracted to it because they want to see what\u2019s \u2018behind the veil\u2019.\u201d Job done, she thought. Or not. \u201cThey took no heed, and the first cover I got back was a woman in an Afghani burqa, with a go-go boot sticking out.\u201d She raises her hands in disbelief. The cover ended up being designed by an artist friend, Chris Kyung: a map of the earth complete with Seattle\u2019s Space Needle and the Sheraton Doha. It is eccentric, science-fictiony, much closer to her idiosyncratic sensibility. She tells me she \u201ccan\u2019t be a spokesperson\u201d or a \u201cnative informant\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a native of anywhere, so, it just feels\u2026\u201d she shrugs.

But the Garden Bridge\u2019s aura of invincibility looks as if it might finally be wearing off. UK transport secretary Chris Grayling is to decide this week whether to extend the \u00a315m central government guarantee for the \u00a3175m project, currently due to expire in September, and he is understood to be considering every option. With capital spending coming under increasing scrutiny since the EU referendum, murmurs from Whitehall suggest that former mayor of London Boris Johnson is now the \u201clone voice\u201d in the cabinet in support of the project.   Related: HS2 and the garden bridge are vanity projects \u2013 it's not too late to scrap both | Catherine Bennett    His mayoral successor, Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is clearly keen to find an expedient way out. A reluctant supporter of the bridge, based on the odd logic that it would cost more to cancel it, Khan suspended preparatory construction work in early July over fears that it would require more public money. Before construction has even begun, the Garden Bridge Trust has somehow burned through more than half of the \u00a360m of public funds earmarked for the project, and it still has a funding gap of roughly \u00a332m. There\u2019s little confidence that the bridge boosters have any idea how to fill this gap, let alone how to generate the income needed to cover the estimated \u00a33m annual operating costs.  An independent report on the project\u2019s business plan, published by Dan Anderson of the tourism consultancy Fourth Street, concluded it would have been \u201cunlikely to pass muster for even a small grant from one of the traditional Lottery funds\u201d. It was so flawed, Anderson told the Guardian, he believed the trust was going forward on the assumption that the taxpayer would bail it out if necessary.  Such is the unease surrounding how this costly \u201ctiara\u201d for the Thames got so far, it is now subject to four official inquiries. The National Audit Office has launched an investigation into the \u00a330m given by the Department for Transport, Transport for London has appointed Ernst &amp; Young to carry out an audit of its \u00a330m, Sadiq Khan is scrutinising the procurement process and the Charity Commission has opened an \u201coperational compliance\u201d case into how on earth the trust is managing to spend all the money so quickly.  Whether the saga will grind on, or the \u00a337m be written off in a puff of green-tinged smoke, the Garden Bridge will stand as the disastrous epitaph of an Ozymandian mayor who left the capital strewn with the wreckage of his own self-promotion, a city littered with forlorn relics of his botched backroom deals.

Photograph: Image Broker/Rex Shutterstock    The first in a grand series of Boris Johnson\u2019s novelty infrastructure projects that didn\u2019t quite go according to plan, the Thames cable car was to be a \u201cstunning addition to London\u2019s transport network\u201d \u2013 a vital link that would also be a thrilling attraction, with its \u00a325m price tag paid for entirely by private sponsorship. Costs ballooned to \u00a360m, \u00a324m of which was picked up by the taxpayer, while the sponsor, Emirates airline, had its name tattooed on the tube map in perpetuity. Only after the dangleway was erected, and its Jestsons\u2019-style cabins were slung across the river in the manner of a 1960s Expo park, did anyone realise there wasn\u2019t actually much demand to travel between the Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks. Just two years after it opened, it didn\u2019t have a single regular user. The sauna on wheels     Mobile sweatbox \u2026 Boris Johnson launching London\u2019s Routemaster bus in 2011.

The project that most encapsulates Johnson\u2019s mayoralty, the New Routemaster was to represent a triumphant return to the glory days of London transport with a nostalgic design that would bring back conductors and a \u201chop on, hop off\u201d back door, as well as be more fuel efficient \u2013 with all costs \u201cborne by the industry\u201d. In reality, Transport for London (TfL) footed the \u00a311m development bill, while the finished bus cost twice as much as a regular double-decker. They lack openable windows, suffer from dodgy air conditioning, and have proved just as polluting as the old buses, while the promised second conductor was too expensive to implement, so the back door remains mostly closed.

The colossus of Stratford Fearing that a \u201cflat-pack\u201d stadium set in the post-industrial wilds of the East End might not have quite the glamour needed for the global televised spectacle of the Olympic Games, Johnson hatched a plan. \u201cWe decided we needed something extra,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething to arouse the curiosity and wonder of Londoners and visitors.\u201d    Related: Into Orbit: my dizzying drop down the world's biggest slide    The result, allegedly spawned from a chance meeting in the cloakrooms at Davos, was the ArcelorMittal Orbit, a knotted tangle of steel by Anish Kapoor that looms above the park as a monument to metal magnate Lakshmi Mittal, then the country\u2019s richest man.

Yet, under Johnson, the promised legacy plan took on a very different character. The pledge of 10,000 new homes mysteriously dwindled to 6,000 in the park. The athletes\u2019 village, built at a cost of \u00a31.1bn, was sold for about half that price to Qatar. The promise of 50% affordable homes, with sites set aside for community-led housing projects, also evaporated: plots have instead been sold to the usual volume house builders, with affordable levels reaching a maximum of 30%. A plague of tacky towers Drab, featureless and phallocratic is how Johnson described the rash of 27 tall buildings that Ken Livingstone had waved through, a pox that was fast threatening to turn London into \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d. His solution? If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em. At the end of his tenure, there are a further 436 towers in the pipeline, scattered indiscriminately from Bermondsey to Battersea and beyond. Slammed by former City planning chief and tower cheerleader Peter Rees as \u201cpiles of safe-deposit boxes\u201d, they are of an architectural quality that plumbs the depths of even the most venal speculative developers\u2019 pattern books. One silver lining of the Brexit doom-cloud: many of them may now be halted. Unaffordable housing   Related: Growing pains: how will London house 1.5 million more people by 2030?    Johnson boasts that he built more affordable homes in his two terms than Livingstone ever managed \u2013 a statistic that conveniently ignores that the definition of \u201caffordable\u201d was utterly transformed during his tenure. Previously linked to local incomes, it now means anything up to 80% of market rate \u2013 by no means affordable to the majority of Londoners. Westminster council warned Johnson the new policy would require council tenants in a three-bedroom home in the borough to have an annual income of \u00a3109,000, while noting half its social rented households receive an income of less than \u00a312,000 a year. Johnson also abandoned Livingstone\u2019s 50% affordable target, allowing developers to hide behind their confidential viability assessments to justify levels as low as 10%. Abuse of the planning system The mayor has the power to \u201ccall in\u201d major schemes deemed to be of \u201cstrategic importance\u201d to London and overturn decisions made by the local planning authority. Of the 14 schemes Johnson called in, 13 were decided in favour of the developer, betraying a hunger to bolster his figures no matter what the cost to the local area. Almost two-thirds of developments breached the mayor\u2019s own density guidelines. From Convoys Wharf to Mount Pleasant, Johnson ended up using his powers to actively prevent councils from providing low-rented housing where there was urgent local need for it, while setting a dangerous precedent for bypassing the democratic planning process.

Mohammad Shakeel fled the village of Pandori, 80km south of Islamabad, soon after a complaint was lodged with police on Saturday accusing him and other family members of murdering his former wife Samia Shahid. It is alleged that Shahid, 28, had been tricked into travelling to Pakistan and killed for marrying against the wishes of her family. On Wednesday, some of the most senior policemen in the Punjab province, as well as agents from Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, descended on Pandori and searched two of the cluster of houses where the extended family live. The case, which has been highlighted by the Bradford West MP Naz Shah, has become a priority after Pakistan\u2019s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, announced that he had ordered a rapid investigation. Also under suspicion is Shahid\u2019s father, Mohammad, who told police he discovered his daughter\u2019s body, with vomit around her mouth, in Shakeel\u2019s house on Wednesday 20 July. Wisal Fakhar Sultan, the regional police officer for Rawalpindi, said police were investigating whether Shahid had killed herself, accidentally taken an overdose or been deliberately poisoned. Tablets and mobile phones were taken from Shakeel\u2019s house and a forensics laboratory in Lahore has been ordered to speed up analysis of samples taken from Shahid\u2019s body. One officer told the Guardian it was likely she had been deliberately poisoned. He said bruising had been found on her neck and shoulders, contradicting earlier statements by the police. Officials said Shahid\u2019s cousin Mobeen, her sister Madiha and her mother Imtiaz Bibi were all also under investigation. Shahid\u2019s father was briefly arrested on Monday night but later released following the intervention of a local politician. Mujahid Khan, a senior officer from the local district of Jhelum, said her father was \u201cunder strict surveillance\u201d and that his passport had been confiscated to stop him from leaving the country. Mohammad Shahid told the Guardian he had attempted to call Shakeel to ask him to give himself up to the police but had not been able to get through. \u201cMy daughter was living with her husband Shakeel and I used to visit her every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI went as usual on Wednesday and I found her lying on the stairs. Shakeel and all of the rest of the family were in my home next door.\u201d The imposing compounds searched by police on Tuesday are some the largest houses in Pandori, where Mohammad Shahid enjoys prestige as the wealthy owner of a Bradford curry house. Police have struggled to find any neighbours to help them with their inquiries who are not family members. The family insist Shahid was married to Shakeel, a first cousin, and police in Pakistan say they have not received any documents proving otherwise. In fact, she divorced him in a UK sharia court in 2014 and then remarried a man called Syed Mukhtar Kazam after taking the incendiary step of converting to Shi\u2019ism, a different sect to the Sunni faith of her family. Friends of Shahid in the UK said the family felt so dishonoured by her behaviour that they did not acknowledge she had remarried. West Yorkshire police last year warned a member of Shahid\u2019s family in Bradford for harassing her. She had returned home from Dubai, where she had been living with her new husband, and hoped to reconcile with her relatives, but was so afraid of them that she asked a female police officer to accompany her to the family home in Manningham. Even in the presence of the police officer, one relative abused her and was given an official harassment warning, police said. Kazam was so concerned about her safety that he tried to prevent her visiting Pakistan to see her family last week after she received messages saying her father was extremely unwell. He flew to Pakistan after learning of her death to lodge a complaint with police.  On Wednesday, a 37-year-old man and 32-year-old woman were in custody in Bradford in connection to alleged threats made against Shah, the MP who raised the alarm about the case, West Yorkshire police said. Shah said she could not comment on the nature of threats allegedly made to her, but said she had been called by police to discuss her security arrangements. She said she had received a briefing from the Pakistani authorities on Wednesday to say that the interior minister was overseeing the case personally.  \u201cI was told that the case is now under his watch and he has assigned two of his most senior and capable officers to the investigation,\u201d she said \u201cI feel reassured by this development because the investigation has gone from them basically doing nothing and saying they were just waiting for the forensic tests to come back to them treating it as a potential murder investigation.

With breathtaking views from its terrace, of the sea to the west and over the city to the north and east, you can understand why it\u2019s become a favourite haunt of the middle class here \u2013 whether it\u2019s the young women (many with head coverings, some more daringly without) and men sipping tea and sucking water pipes filled with sweet-flavoured tobacco delivered by a narghila man in a fez, or the families out for an evening treat enjoying caesar salads or pepper steaks brought to their tables by impeccably black-tunicked waiters. It could be a popular hangout in Dubai or Sharm El Sheikh \u2013 only classier.    Related: Travel ban on Gazan musicians mars cultural exchange | Letters     But hang on. This is Gaza. At night, especially when the city is plunged into darkness by the daily power cuts of eight hours or more, you can see the beams of boats fishing off the coast to one side, and the twinkling of lights in Israel on the other \u2013 so near and yet so unreachable for the imprisoned vast majority of the city\u2019s 700,000 inhabitants. At such moments, with its own, generator-powered lights shining out from the top of the Zafer tower, Level Up seems like a beacon of sophistication in a city that has been under siege, and suffered three devastating Israeli military onslaughts, over the nine years since Hamas took control.      Level Up advertises itself as a \u2018multi-service hospitality complex\u2019. Photograph: Level Up     Somehow, elements of another Gaza have survived what has been \u2013 literally and metaphorically \u2013 its darkest decade: stylish, civilised, worthy of a history stretching back five millennia. While few other cities have been more fought over or occupied \u2013 by the ancient Egyptians, Romans, Byzantines, Abbasids, Crusaders, Mamluks, Turks, British, Egypt again and Israel \u2013 there have also been long periods when Gaza was a centre of culture and learning, as well as a flourishing port and trading centre. Today, the all too regular TV images of plumes of black smoke soaring from burning, bombed-out buildings obscure its stubborn endurance as not only the biggest but the most metropolitan of Palestinian cities. There are two major universities, internationally exhibited artists, a music school that is part of the Edward Said network of conservatories, some of the region\u2019s best rappers, a few hotels and restaurants as good as any in the Holy Land, and a well-designed museum of treasures from Gaza\u2019s rich past built by Jawdat al Khodari, a fellow Gazan entrepreneur with a passion for archaeology.   But Eleiwa remains an optimist. As a serial owner of fashionable hotels and restaurants in a market imploded by war and economic blockade, what else could he be? Level Up\u2019s owner comes from an old family of wheat traders who also owned many acres of \u2013 now obliterated \u2013 orange groves in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip. His career in what he calls the \u201chospitality and tourism\u201d business started 1991 as a \u201chobby\u201d, when he was working as a human resources manager and development expert for an international aid agency.  Eleiwa opened a small beach restaurant at a time when it could only open for a few hours because of an Israeli-imposed curfew. \u201cThe [first] intifada was still going,\u201d he recalls. \u201cPeople needed to breathe, to be able to live their lives.\u201d     Fishing has traditionally supported the livelihoods of thousands of families across the Gaza Strip. Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPA    A quarter of a century later, he says they still do. Eleiwa opened Level up in 2014, just before the third and bloodiest of the Gaza wars. Three weeks in, the building\u2019s developer, Mohammed Abu Mathkour, was phoned by an Israeli intelligence officer and told to take down a communications antenna that had been installed on the roof by Hamas. Caught between two colliding enemies, Mathkour said he couldn\u2019t do that without the permission of Hamas\u2019s interior ministry. The day after, Israeli tank shells hit the upper floors of the tower, causing serious damage in the first of two attacks \u2013 but not so serious that the restaurant could not be quickly repaired and re-opened after the war ended. Level Up was an instant success with a clientele that Eleiwa insists is not \u201celite\u201d but \u201cmiddle and even lower-middle class\u201d. While many, if not most, Gazans could not afford to eat here, Eleiwa says he keeps his prices as low as possible while making a modest profit. The pepper steak may be \u00a310, but hummus or baba ganoush (a crushed aubergine and tahini salad) and tea cost nine shekels (\u00a31.60). When Eleiwa recruited his first 20 workers, he had well over 400 applications without even advertising \u2013 hardly surprisingly when the World Bank puts Gaza\u2019s unemployment rate at around 40%, among the highest in the world. Monthly Level Up salaries start at around 1,600 shekels (around \u00a3280) for a newly recruited cleaner, competitive by Gaza standards, plus progressive fringe benefits. Now Eleiwa has 32 full-time employees, boasts a \u201cvirtually zero\u201d turnover of staff, and \u2013 remarkably \u2013 is planning a new hotel on the beach here. His first, the once-famous five-star Windmill Hotel, literally went up in flames in October 2000, when Islamist protesters attacked it for allowing guests to drink their own alcohol on the premises.     An apartment building collapses after it was hit by missiles during an Israeli air strike on Gaza. Photograph: Mohammed Othman/AFP/Getty Images    So why would he embark on another \u2013 alcohol-free, of course \u2013 hotel when bed occupancy in the city is only 20%? \u201cBecause it\u2019s my business, and in this line of business, if you excel, if you distinguish yourself based on better service and better quality, you will have your share of the market.\u201d But beyond this borderline management-speak, Eleiwa has another, more emotional response. \u201cThis is my Gaza; I belong to this place. One day Gaza will have its opportunity in this line of business, and I assure you it will compete with the region \u2013 because we have the basic factors for this industry to excel: wonderful weather, a wonderful beach, and most of the Gaza people enjoy hospitality by nature.\u201d    You will go the beach and see the poorest people with their small sandwich and a cup of tea. We love to live our lives  Basil Eleiwa     But even supposing the political circumstances were miraculously transformed, wouldn\u2019t it take forever to restore the city\u2019s infrastructure, clean its coastal waters \u2013 heavily polluted with sewage \u2013 and market Gaza as the most improbable of all holiday destinations? Isn\u2019t the city\u2019s fate to be continually preparing for a future that never comes? \u201cPalestinian people have sacrificed a lot throughout the last six decades,\u201d Eleiwa says. \u201cAt one point we might get a leadership that will light this candle at the end of the tunnel for us.\u201d He suggests that, \u201cwhile not taking Israel out of the picture as the main factor in our misery\u201d, a lack of effective leadership that has left the two main Palestinian factions desperately split is also \u201ca fundamental problem of the Palestinian people\u201d. Amid all these challenges, Eleiwa is determinedly \u201cworking for our future generation\u201d \u2013 one which, with 18,000 graduates every year hinting for a handful of jobs, has been left \u201cwith no hope \u2026 We\u2019re maintaining good service standards that could one day be the basis of our competition with the region and the world.\u201d           After Banksy: the parkour guide to Gaza    And in the mean time, he is ensuring that at least a corner of Gaza\u2019s economy does not go dark. \u201cEven if the business gets worse and I\u2019m still able to pay my suppliers and my staff, that\u2019s more than enough.\u201d On the terrace of Level Up, high above the city, it\u2019s easy to forget the harsh facts of life in the Gaza strip: 80% of families aid dependent; repairs completed on just 2% of more than 9,000 UN-managed housing units destroyed in a 2014 war which killed over 2,100 Palestinians; an estimated 53% of young adults \u201clikely\u201d to suffer clinical depression. Yet for all their pain, Eleiwa insists enjoyment is embedded in Gazans\u2019 \u201ccoastal culture\u201d. Every Friday, he says, \u201cYou will go the beach and see the poorest people are there with their small sandwich and a cup of tea. We love to live our lives.\u201d That last sentence is a conscious echo of a line Eleiwa likes to quote from Mahmoud Darwish, the most famous of all Palestinian poets: \u201cWe love life, if we can find a way to it.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "title": "The future of Gaza: from city under siege to world tourism hub?", "sentences": ["It could be a popular hangout in Dubai or Sharm El Sheikh \u2013 only classier."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-28T06:30:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/honour-killings-qandeel-baloch-samia-shahid", "tags": ["Crime", "Bradford", "UK news", "Women", "Pakistan", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Naz Shah", "Feminism", "Equality"], "article": "\u201cWhy do men bask in \u2018honour\u2019 and women bear the burden of \u2018shame\u2019?\u201d A thought-provoking question from Sayeeda Warsi last Tuesday during a discussion about the Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch, who was murdered by her brother, in an \u201chonour killing\u201d. A week later, I am left asking the same question in response to the suspicious death of one of my constituents, Samia Shahid \u2013 again in Pakistan. I know how tightly scripted a young woman\u2019s life can be in my community. And I know how dangerous it can be when you don\u2019t stick to the script. Shahid went to visit her family, who were also in Pakistan at the time, for a week. The day before she was due to return, and just hours after her last text, she was found dead by her father. Shahid\u2019s husband insists that she was murdered. He says he has good reason to believe so: they had both received death threats in the past, after Shahid left her cousin and moved to Dubai, having also converted to her husband\u2019s sect of Islam.

I have also urged the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to intervene. There are those in my community who would rather not have this discussion, let alone in public. But when is there a right time or place when tackling taboo subjects? We must talk about this if we are ever to rid our society of this illness. This isn\u2019t about honour: this is about power, and control of women in patriarchal communities. These are crimes driven by the desire to control. This is personal. This is my community, and my constituents. Shahid was, like the girls I grew up with, Bradford born and bred. And maybe it is easier for me to talk about this taboo precisely because it is my community \u2013 Shahid could have been one of my mates. Whatever the truth in this particular case, for too long, we\u2019ve had a mixed response to \u201chonour killings\u201d in this country: on one hand, murder is murder. But on the other (shaky, sweaty and politically correct) hand, we are careful not to intrude in others\u2019 cultures.     \u2018Samia Shahid was like the girls I grew up with, Bradford born and bred.\u2019 Photograph: Supplied    The worst bigotry is the bigotry of low expectations. We must not stay silent just because we don\u2019t understand something. This may not be everyone\u2019s culture, but it is everyone\u2019s problem.

Samia Shahid, 28, died last week after allegedly being tricked into travelling to Pakistan by her family, who allegedly disapproved of her love marriage to a man from a different Islamic sect. Pakistani police investigating the death told the Guardian on Sunday that there were \u201cno visible injuries or signs of violence\u201d on Shahid\u2019s body when it was found last Wednesday in the family home in Pandori, Jhelum, 50 miles (80km) south of Islamabad. A postmortem report released on Thursday shows that her body did in fact have a \u201creddish brown linear horizontal bruise measuring about 19cm extending from just below [the] right ear and around the neck\u201d. The Guardian has seen photographs of Shahid\u2019s body, which appear to confirm the finding. There also appear to be two purple welts around her neck. Naz Shah, Shahid\u2019s MP in Bradford West, has accused Pakistani authorities of a potential cover-up in light of the findings. She said on Thursday: \u201cI originally intervened in this case to demand that there was a proper investigation into my constituent\u2019s death, saying it had all the hallmarks of a so-called \u2018honour\u2019 killing. Having seen the autopsy report, I think we are now also looking at a case involving a potential cover-up.\u201d Shah said she had spoken to the Pakistani high commissioner to the UK, Syed Ibne Abbas, who told her the Pakistani ombudsman was investigating. \u201cI have asked for the police officer and the physician who did the first postmortem to be investigated,\u201d the MP said. \u201cJust a few days ago they were telling us the autopsy was inconclusive and that there were no visible signs on her body and now the autopsy report shows that there were marks on her neck.\u201d Shahid\u2019s family have said variously that she died of a heart attack or an asthma attack and insist they did not kill her. On Thursday, Shahid\u2019s second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, said he was not satisfied with the police and demanded a fresh postmortem. \u201cThey are trying to cover up this murder,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life has been threatened, but there is no question of being quiet. It is a question of justice and my agenda is she was killed and I need justice for her.\u201d He alleges that his wife was tricked into travelling to Pakistan by relatives who falsely claimed a relative had fallen ill there. On Wednesday, a special team was set up to hunt for Shahid\u2019s first husband, Mohammed Shakeel, who fled Pandori soon after a complaint was lodged with police on Saturday accusing him and other family members of murdering his former wife.  On Thursday, the district police officer for Jhelum, Mujahid Akbar, told the Guardian that Shakeel has been granted pre-arrest bail by the Rawalpindi high court. This procedure affords legal relief to a defendant in anticipation of a possible arrest, effectively meaning they cannot be arrested. Police said Shakeel presented himself to the authorities for questioning on Thursday. The family insist Shahid was married to Shakeel, a first cousin, and police in Pakistan say they have not received any documents proving otherwise.  In fact, she divorced him in a UK sharia court in 2014 and then married Kazam at Leeds town hall in September 2014, after converting to Shia Islam, while her family is Sunni. Friends of Shahid in the UK said the family felt so dishonoured by her behaviour that they did not acknowledge she had remarried. A family member in Bradford was given a harassment warning by police in September 2015 when Shahid, who was living in Dubai, returned to the UK to try to patch things up with her family, West Yorkshire police said.

Related: Big Orange lifts stayers\u2019 cup at Glorious Goodwood for second year    But his odds are now unappealingly skinny at 100-30, considering this 20-runner handicap is nearly always closely fought. With Ryan Moore due to ride and being from the Michael Bell yard that won Thursday\u2019s big race, his odds may shorten further. In view of all that can go wrong around Goodwood it is hard to take such short odds for a race like this. Red Avenger (3.10) at 25-1 is at the preferred end of the market. Has it been forgotten that he won this race two years ago from a 1lb higher mark? Of course, there have been many reverses since then, including a 15-length defeat here on his reappearance in May. But the Gary Moore-trained selection was beaten as far in that race last year before scoring at Newcastle the following month from the same mark he has now. It is to be hoped that Thursday\u2019s rain has not made too much difference to the ground because the fast surface that prevailed earlier in the week would be ideal for Red Avenger. He is handily drawn in stall three, should race prominently and miss the inevitable trouble behind and looks a very fair each-way play at those odds. 2.00 Goodwood Kings Fete, from the Sir Michael Stoute yard, is the likely favourite here, as all those who feel they were robbed at Royal Ascot try to get it back. A close third despite the interference he suffered, he ran a mighty race on only his second start after a 20-month absence but there is a risk he may just lack the necessary pace in these different circumstances. Who, after all, wants to take a short price about a horse that has not won for two years? So Mount Logan might be the way to go, in view of his perfect record of three wins from three visits to Goodwood, including a Listed contest over this course and distance in May. This is a step down in class from the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot, in which he was a fair fourth last time. The first two from that race have since been first and third in the King George.

The lovely setting, harbour and beach were unchanged, of course, but a lot of buildings were in sore need of a lick of paint.

In all, the reports include 42 complaints about or experience of fatigue; 25 bird strikes; 10 medical emergencies; five laser incidents; one bomb threat; one \u201cdogs on the runway\u201d; and one unstable aircraft due to unstable truffles. The Guardian put the concerns raised by the pilots to Flydubai.   Related: Airline pilots complain of dangerous fatigue in leaked documents    The airline said it had developed a \u201cblame free\u201d working culture to allow pilots to raise anxieties. \u201cConcerns around rostering and fatigue have been raised as part of the open safety reporting mechanism and however small the proportion we take them all equally seriously,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe system is designed to encourage pilots to report all safety concerns as soon as possible. \u201cFlydubai has never and would never ask its crew to operate outside legally permitted hours. All flights are planned within legal limits. \u201cWe have developed a comprehensive operational system with safety at its core. Our policies, procedures and control systems are applied to every operational function of our airline. They exist to provide our crews with a safe, regulated framework to help them meet the demands of their roles.\u201d Acronyms  NCC Network crew control FMS Flight management system SCCM Senior cabin crew member OM-A Operations manual A ATC Air traffic control RWY Runway SOP Standard operating procedure SO Second officer FDP Flight duty period ASR Air safety report Bomb scare 512 DXB-IEV Dubai to Kiev, Ukraine Less than an hour before reaching our destination in Kiev, the senior came to the cockpit and informed us of a passenger who had told a cabin crew member that he had a bomb on board. The senior told that the situation had occurred when the cabin crew had refused to serve the passenger any more alcohol because he was getting too intoxicated and was becoming aggressive. It became quite apparent that he most likely did not have a bomb, but we of course did not want to take any chances (he was Russian, we were just entering Ukraine, he was very verbal about being a Putin supporter \u2013 do the maths!), so we called NCC straight away. The crew started bomb search checklist according to OM-A with no findings. We decided to keep low profile with the situation on board to avoid any panic.  Upon landing in Kiev, the ATC told us to park on the taxi way, and at this point i informed passengers to remain seated since we had not reached our parking position. We did know what the local authorities plan was at this stage, but i was communicating directly with airport police from the cockpit window. We were probably waiting for 30 minutes on the taxi way with very little information.  The only thing they told me was that we were not allowed to disembark until \u2018special forces\u2019 arrived on scene. It is fair to say that the whole situation seemed very unprofessional and disorganized on their part, since we were waiting for such a long time, and as i told them \u2013 if we DID indeed have a bomb on our aircraft, i wanted to get my passengers off asap.  They were informed by NCC at least 30 minutes before we even landed in Kiev, and yet, we were waiting for so long. The passengers were of course becoming impatient and agitated, since they did not know what was going on, so i decided to make an announcement where i told them there was a \u2018security incident\u2019, and that we were awaiting airport officials. I did not want to lie, but i also wanted to avoid using the word \u2018bomb\u2019.  Finally, after approximately 200 security and military personel had surrounded the aircraft in a very dramatic manor, the were ready to come on board. They wanted to evacuate the passengers, but at this point i had to refuse, since the whole situation was a getting a bit ridiculous. As i told them, we had been sitting on the taxi way for over 30 minutes \u2013 if there had been a bomb on board, it would most probably have been detonated already!!  I did not want to cause panic and possible injury to my passengers, so i insisted on a normal disembarkation after the man was removed by police. After all passengers had left the aircraft, we did a thorough bomb search with the bomb squad (technical compartments etc were checked by FO).  No findings, but quite a delay.  Fatigue an pilot safety concerns 354 LYP-DXB Faisalabad, Pakistan, to Dubai Senior sleeping during flight in a business class!  During cruise stage, before I came out of the flight deck for physical need, it was brought to my attention by crew member that the Senior was sleeping in the business class seat. I immediately requested one of the crew to wake him, later he was again observed through security camera sleeping on the jump seat. After landing, the senior was debriefed. 382 URKK-OMBD Krasnodar, Russia, to Dubai The flight was Initially delayed out of Dubai due to boarding and ATC. Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft\u2019s wings would need de-icing due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers.  During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the multi-cultural mix of the crew and said \u2018why aren\u2019t there more Russian crew on the flight?\u2019 The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn\u2019t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^&amp; .  The flight deck was made aware of the situation by SCM, the captain elected to offload the passengers in light of their inebriated state and verbal abuse of the crew. During the above delay the captain was also talking with NCC as it was becoming apparent the flight deck and most likely cabin crew would be going in to discretion. In light of the length of the initial duty, time of report, crew\u2019s rest, subsequent planned duties and the stress of the onboard situations it was agreed as a crew that we would not be happy to go in to discretion. The captain had numerous conversations with NCC explaining the situation yet NCC kept using unrealistic timings and calculations that were not based on facts from KRR. NCC appeared to have a distrust of the flight decks information and kept asking to speak with the FZ ground staff who reiterated the same information passed on by the flight deck. The ground staff was exceptionally busy dealing with multiple issues and to be continually called and interrupted by NCC was unhelpful and exacerbated the delays. It is unsafe and unhelpful for crewing to continually ask the crew to go in to discretion especially after the crew have said they don\u2019t feel safe to continue in to discretion. Once the crew have made the statement they aren\u2019t safe to go in to discretion it should be taken as set in stone and not something to try and whittle away at! No one wants to cause additional delays, disruption and end up at an out station. If we felt safe to continue to Dubai we would have done so! The flight eventually departed 1hr 43mins late, with the crew agreeing to set off for Dubai but knowing that we would be most likely diverting to Kuwait. It became quickly apparent that our initial assessment was correct and it was agreed we would divert to Kuwait, this was revised to Doha after NCC called on the SATCOM to say there were no seats available from Kuwait for 8 hours. NCC called the aircraft SAT phone approximately 4 times during the flight with the last call being made after being specifically asked not to call anymore as we were very busy and it was an unwanted distraction, they were asked to send an ACARS message to communicate if required.  During the last call NCC asked AGAIN for us to continue on to Dubai despite the crew stating numerous times prior they were diverting as they didn\u2019t feel safe to continue! It is unacceptable to apply pressure, however pleasantly it is done, trying to sweet talk a crew in to doing something they have said they feel is unsafe is unprofessionally and extremely dangerous! We arrived in to Doha at 0812 just over 1 hour in to discretion. The KRR crew were relieved by the stby crew at approximately 0945. The total duty was 16hrs 09mins. 390 DXB-JED Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Reported fatigued for duty, due to fatigue resulting from assigned roster. 405 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul, Afghanistan Waited on ground with passengers on board from approximately 9am to 5pm due to ground delays and general disorganization from ramp personel. Without adequate food and water we disembarked the passengers. Crew control scheduled me for another flight that was inevitably going to go into discretion. I was tired, hungry and unfit for the extra duty. I went home fatigued. 418 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul From time to time I have difficulty in sleeping due to my body clock constantly changing due to the amount of switching from day to night flights I have been subjected to over the last 4 years or more. I can produce my rosters if required. I could not sleep before my 301 duty, although I had been up since 0515 that morning, and went to bed at around 6pm ready for my 0320 report. In the interest of safety I deemed it better to not operate in a tired/fatigued condition. This was not a case of tactical sickness, but a genuine case of not being able to sleep, and the safety implications of operating an aircraft in an unsuitable condition. At this stage I do not think I need to visit an AME, but if it continues beyond my annual leave I will consult the relevent departments in flydubai. XXXXX Dubai to Muscat, Oman I was scheduled to fly 4 sectors with xxxxx. Following are my serious concerns about xxxxx\u2019s flying technique, adherence to SOPs and lack of CRM. 1. Bounced Landing: In absolutely calm winds at Muscat, ILS 26 R the aircraft bounced after landing and touched down very firmly the second time, in my opinion it was due to wrong flare technique. 2. He has constant habit of making and then executing FMS route and approach changes without informing other crew member, that includes deletion of planned route points and creating and executing new way points for approach. This is a serious flight safety issue and he must be briefed about the company SOPs on the subject. 3. He has a dangerous tendency to go heads down and make and executes FMS changes being PF, and that too well below 7500 feet in Dubai terminal area with extreme air traffic all around. This all he does even when PM is not doing any other task. When told to refrain from this, he makes gestures of annoyance and then stop announcing FMA changes as a reaction, and does not respond to FMS changes announced by the PM on his behalf. 4. Almost on every before and after take off checklist and landing checklist he announces it through memory and does not even bother to take it out or use the one on control column, which is obvious as he does not turn on the light and his note book covering the checklist on control column. Occasionally he takes out the checklist but makes no effort to read it, he just holds it and announce checks verbally. 5. He makes gestures and raises his voice when told to do something, he does not like to be told anything and shows no respect and courtesy to other crew member. 474 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi, Pakistan Fatigue report Shifting to morning flight after 3 days night flights then back again to fly late night flight didn\u2019t allow me to get at least couple of hours of sleep before the flight. In addition, I was coming from a long fight which needed a proper rest. 478 BTS-DXB Bratislava, Slovakia, to Dubai Exceeding maximum hours duty  I was rostered to fly to TIF [Taif, Saudi Arabia] reporting at 0540Z. I shall preface this report with the note that this was an exceptional day, and we were all in some degree of shock from the tragedy we\u2019d all just heard about. I reported on time and we proceeded to the aircraft. Whilst preparing the aircraft for passengers, crew control called me and told me that they needed to change me to a different flight, BTS (785/6). I said that I would prefer not to operate such a long day if possible, but since it was such an unusual day, if they really needed me then of course I would help. Crew control said that I was their only option and 100% they needed me, so I agreed. It was about 0640Z by the time I was able to reach the other aircraft, 2 other crew members arrived as well after me and we departed at 0757Z. The rest of the day proceeded as planned, with about 30 mins of holding on the arrival back into Dubai. I was off duty at 2131Z. The scheduled length of duty day, from \u2018off blocks\u2019 till \u2018off duty\u2019 (since I had already checked in) for that flight is 13:00. The actual time we did it in was 13:34.  I knew that I must be high on hours as I had already had one flight removed after a standby call out in order to maintain my legality in that week, however I assumed that I would not be asked to do anything that would take me over any limits.Looking at ecrew, it says that my total duty time for a 7 day period, from the 13th \u2013 19th March was 62 hours. OM-A 7.18.1 says that the max should be 55, or increased up to 60 in case of unforeseen delays. I understand that these were exceptional circumstances, but even given that, it looks like I was asked to undertake the duty knowing that it would take me over the maximum duty limit. We left as quickly as we could, and flew the plane as expected. I raise this, mostly for the safety of our crews. In times like this where we are experiencing extreme disruption, it\u2019s easy to forget about limits, but they are there for a reason. We are often rostered close to the limit anyway, and the crewing department do need to be careful with what they are asking people to do. If my calculations are not correct, then I am willing to be corrected, but I\u2019m just reporting what they system\u2019s telling me.  484 DXB-KWI Dubai to Kuwait UNFIT FOR FLIGHT Following 3 consecutive night duties ending this morning at 02:19 LT I couldn\u2019t rest properly for my next flight FZ63 with reporting time at 16:20 LT. I advised Crew Control and offered to swap my following day off for any flight so that I could get a longer rest period, but there was no option available. 491 AAA-AAA Very difficult week after the accident, lot of commotion, ops disruptions, lot of flights in sequence, yesterday from KWI to DWC [Kuwait to Dubai World Central] very bad wx from 6000ft until landing at DWC, followed for a G/A. Lack of sleep tonight, only 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I am feeling tired. 495 OMDB-URKK Dubai to Krasnodar Flight to krasnodar planned into discretion when taking into account the garaunteed de-icing at destination and the weather in Dubai upon arrival which would inevitably create delays, not to mention planning to arrive at the morning busy period in Dubai. Actual FDP originally 10:30, max FDP 11:15, adjusted FDP by crew planning 10:40. This 10:40 adjusted FDP was only achieved by reducing the ground time in KRR from 1 hour to 45 minutes, completely unrealistic for that airport. During a day flight this could be a tight but acceptable way of planning.  During a night flight this method of pushing to the limit is unacceptable and unsafe. Both captain and FO were called from standby. The original FO called sick at 1500LT, I was called at 1800LT (1:55 before report). If crew control had called me at 1500 to inform me of the night flight I would be assigned to, I could have prepared well by taking a 3 hour nap. The way it went now is that I hadnt slept before the flight and thus was extremely tired after a 11:31 FDP night. Crew control needs to adjust their understanding of human factors.  497 NS-NS I am not fit to operate the flight tomorrow morning. I did my best to do my duties the last 2 days after some sleep disruption due to the accident. during my 2 last night flights I managed to get 2/3 hours of sleep per day. I came back home today after a long kuwait delayed due to weather in dubai. I Slept 0130 and woke up due to the situation back to my home town related to the the attacks in Brussels. I then couldnt get any sleep up until now (0135 am) In the last 8 days, I have been doing afternoon flights (double sector), followed by night, then morning, then 1 days off followed by night, then night again followed by a early morning that I just cant do.  498 MCT-DXB Muscat to Dubai Originally scheduled to make the flight DXB / MHD / DXB report with time at 11: 55Z, and planned to end duty at 19: 05Z. Flight was cancelled for meteorological reasons. The crew control called me before I left home informing of the cancellation and providing me home stby starting at at the current time of my report Team original flight (11:55 Z). Around 15:40 (L), the control crew called me informing that there was one flight I would have to fly. DXB / BND / DXB / HOF / DXB / HOF report with time at 13:00 (UTC), double sector with estimated time of arrival to 22:20 (UTC), ie for 2:20 (local), so 4:15 minutes longer than planned on my roster. As the flight was one double sector, the maximum duty time would be 10:45, which could fly up to the 23:45Z. Upon arriving at the office, I went to talk to the NCC crew control and said that I was not ready to fly until too late because my original flight would finish at 1905Z. I informed that this time I would not have conditions to help them extending my duty. In BND I called the crew control because the flight at that time was already late 1:30, so the flight I was doing, I\u2019d extend my duty. They were not concerned. After landing at DXB, called once more for the crew control stating that as I told before I was not able to extend my duty, and that as the flight was delayed 1:40 and still would have to change planes, I would not make the flight to HOF. The crew control then decided to put me on the flight to MCT, which delayed more 1:30.  I called the crew control, and once again was ignored, saying that I was not able to bring the MCT flight as I was informed before through telephone calling twice. The control crew told me to go to MCT, which would put an extra crew member to the MCT first morning flight to bring the plane, and wanted me to stay four hours in the plane to return as deadheading. I found this a full absurd and a lack of respect. I realized that the crew control is not concerned about the physical or psychological condition of the crew, since such a situation ends up causing a lot of stress. In my opinion they forced the situation, and I just returning from MCT flying in respect of the crews who were with me. In DXB we landed in and extending the duty was 37 mins. To far not had access to the NCC or call the control crew to sign the discretion.  the crew control must learn and to know that the extension of the duty is to be made sporadically, and that can not be as usual as practice as has happened.  499 RUH-DXB Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to Dubai I would suggest a change in the roster when double sector flights. One more time, yesterday, I had to extend my duty in one double sector flight. What has become a common practice in Flydubai, should occur only a few times \u2026 These are the facts. A flight with only 35 minutes to extend the duty, with change of aircraft on the ground, and two arrivals on Busy Period, the control crew really believe that this flight would arrive on schedule? I do not want to believe that the control crew think this would happen. Sorry to say that, but anyone knows that these would have to extend the duty. With this, I once again as flight commander had to go through the stress of extending the duty, which has become constant practice on Flydubai, reaching always tired. Not to say that I have not tried any action, I even called the control crew \u2026 and the answer is always the same, \u201ccaptain I dont have pilots to do this flight\u201d, or are not concerned. The moment is to reflect on what happened and how the pilots have flown and the distribution of flight range, which often puts HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the crew, and at the same time gives him a flight early morning or double sector. It would not be too much to ask a little about those who do nothing for the crew. Those who at the time of tightening call us to do a favor. The company is losing the confidence of pilots, and I can feel and see it when I\u2019m flying with colleagues or even having a good conversation \u2026 it always has the control crew as the end point. 516 NS-NS Having done FZ xxxon the 25th of march, dealing with a bomb threat. I went into discretion by 1 hour and 20 min bringing my total duty time up to 15 hours and 50 min. I came back to my apartment around 01.15 and slept until 05.58.  I haven\u2019t been able to sleep since then..  I called fatigued to Crewcontrol at 1.30pm local Dubai time. Based on me not being able to sleep, and the past weeks extreme pressure following the crash. I do not feel that I will be able to safely operate an aircraft until I have had a chance to recover. My next duty is set to start on wed the 30th. Which I hope I will be ready for..  520 DXB-TIF Dubai to Taif, Saudi Arabia Called fatigued for my night TIF due to insufficient rest prior to the duty, the duty was meant to commence at 1950. I finished my previous duty at 2230 on 25th and was in bed for midnight, I slept for approximately 7 hours but this was disrupted, I was unable to get any more rest prior to 1630. I put this down to the change in sleep patterns. 528 DXB-HBE Dubai to Borg El Arab, Egypt I\u2019m unable to operate FZxxx on the evening of the yyth due to safety concerns of fatigue. I called in fatigue on yy because I was unable to sleep after returning to DXB at 0200z. 536 BTS-DXB Bratislava to Dubai The 785/786 flight to and from BTS is crewed with two sets of pilots, yet the cabin only had one set of crew to operate a flight with a limitation of 14:15 and a planned duty of 14:00. The flight departed 45 minutes late. I understand that the reason given, was that there are not sufficient gates available at that time in the morning, to facilitate an on-time departure. The first passengers arrived 5 minutes prior to the ETD. I understand that the flight was legally planned, but there was no effort, thought or logistics available to achieve the plan. The cabin crew duties for such a flight are exhausting; Selling food &amp; duty free, giving out food boxes and then tidying up, all being achieved whilst crossing jet streams with associated turbulence. I believe the seat belt signs were put on by the flight deck operating 785 at least five times. The turbulence reached moderate on a few occasions. (The same occurred on the way back to Dubai and speed was reduced to M.076 on several occasions.) On arriving at BTS, I took over operation control for the second sector and discretion was discuss with the entire crew.  There was concern among the crew that their energy levels would not be safe, if they entered into discretion. The total duty at the beginning of sector 2 was estimated to be 15 hours.  I relayed this concern to NCC. NCC suggested was the turn-around should be shortened. A departure time in 10 mins and an increase of CI to 150 would avoid entering into discretion. I told them this was unacceptable. At that time, not one passenger had been boarded for FZ786.  Also planning the flight at a CI 150 was totally disingenuous considering the known forecast for turbulence.  NCC disregarded the safety issue presented to them and decided it was purely a mathematical sum to be overcome. As I read the Part A, the published block times should be used for the planning, so suggesting a change in CI to solve the problem was not legal. Also, planning finishes at crew report and any changes that may save time and prevent discretion to be entered, are for the Flight deck to assess ie early departure, shortcuts or flying faster, not NCC and at that time, my assessment was that discretion was unavoidable.  I also have issue with the fact that NCC initially only had one concern and that was to obtain the names of those crew member(s) that considered not exercising their right to use discretion. This is irrelevant. I can only assume it was for unsavoury reasons and is poor practice that should be quashed by management.  542 DXB-TSE Dubai to Astana, Kazakhstan Possible Fatigue induced due to poor/illegal planning by Operational.  Yesterday I and all my crew we where planned to operate a night Astana during the night, reporting at 1555z.  Maximum duty allowed for the cockpit crew was of 1115 that bring our max duty period to end at 0310z. FLIGHT WAS PLANNED TO LAND AT 0310 EXACTLY LEAVING NO SPARE TIME FOR ANY DELAY OR UNPLANNED WHEATEAR, HOLDIG, BOARDING DELAY OR ANYTHING ELSE. BASICCALY EVEN IF ON THE PAPER THE FLIGHT WAS LEGAL WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN WITHOUT AN EXTENSION OF THE DUTY PERIOD SINCE THE BEGINNING.  BUT, lets start from the beginning.  -First fact. In the afternoon I and the Fo both we call the crew control giving an heads up about the flight and the problem that we would have gone to go into if we where operation a flight with such planning of duty. Answer by Ncc was that they would have increase the cost index and reduce the ground time. -Second fact. Weather at the destination was forecast to be marginal with Fog and very low visibility leading in a possible diversion and in a even worst scenario that the already planned one! Considering the temperature of 4^Celsius and tankering fuel due to a possible diversion a De-ice should have been take into consideration and so the fact that a reduced time on the ground was impossible. -Third fact. Once we report for our duty, collected the flight plan, we notice that the second flight, was Estimated to arrive in Dubai at 0326. well behind the maximum duty of 0310z. ILLEGAL. I SAY AGAIN. ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First sector, likewise the second, was planned to be flown at Fl280/290 and cost index of 150 bringing the flight to land yes 10 minutes early but with no margin on the speed windows and no possibility to avoid weather that last night was forecast along all the route. -Forth fact. Cabin crew missing at the reporting, only 3 cabin crew they were planned to operate this duty and also this was bring into attention of crewing in the afternoon. Additional cabin crew they reported at the aircraft once boarding was already in place.  Now this is the story of how a well establish airline like FZ is planning a flight nowadays but is not the point. I understand the difficulties is going through in this period but is not the point. I know Im nobody to say what should have been done and what people more expert then me they should do, but my Point is that: WHAT IS LEGAL IS NOT SAFE. IS NOT SAFE TO PLANED A CREW TO WORK 11:15 MINUTES IN THE DEEP NIGHT, EXPECT THEM TO SHOT A CAT3 APPROACH, CONTINUE BACK TO DUBAI, MAYBE HOLD, AND LAND, EXTEND THE DUTY AND THEN MAYBE REPORT FOR A NEXT FLIGHT REPORTING NEXT MORNING IN THE EARLY MORNING. IS NOT LEGAL TO PLAN A FLIGHT ALREADY KNOWING THAT THE DUTY WOULD BE EXTEND COVERING THEIR BOTTOM ON THE PAPERS WORK AND SAY, IS LEGAL. IS NOT SAFE TO SAY CAPTAIN IS YOUR DECISION BUT PLEASE TRY TO HELP US, IF U DO THIS IF U DO THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT. ALL THIS KIND OF OPERATIONS IS LEADING INTO FATIGUE AND THERE SHUOLD BE NO ACN TO STOP PEOPLE TO CALL FATIGUE WITH THE FEAR TO LOOS THEY MEDICAL LICENCE BECAUSE THIS IS LEADING IN A EVEN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION.  553 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul After two earlies and one night flight landing at midday today, I really needed to sleep upon arriving home, due to poor sleeping cycles on the last 3 nights. 6 hours later I went to bed trying to sleep for my 3am report, but I was only able to sleep for an hour, thus not enough rest to complete my 9h duty. Rest periods were enough in terms of hours, but timings were hardly manageable to get more than 5-6 hours of sleep for two of the last three nights, which made me go to bed after landing today.  XXXXX Beirut, Lebanon, to Dubai Safety Concern  There is a genuine safety concern regarding xxxxx. Over a period of approximately four years there has been four or five rostered duties with the concerned crew member. In summary, it has been witnessed that the crew member displays little or no situational awareness, limited operational understanding, has a tendency to become agitated or inflamed when prompted or asked to act on a parameter and makes excuses and places blame on others when mistakes are made. The crew members\u2019 overall performance during the past rostered duties has been blemished with numerous operational and handling blunders which required immediate intervention to prevent a situation becoming worse.  It is not possible to document every possible event as no record was kept. However with each duty with the mentioned xxxxx, constant supervision is required to ensure flight safety. On one duty returning from Moscow whilst approaching position SAV the senior was summoned to the flight deck to allow a short toilet break and to make a fresh coffee. Upon returning to the flight deck I witnessed the xxxxx did not have their headset on, nor were the speakers switched on. Contact was made immediately with Tehran ATC. During the time the xxxxx did not have the headset placed on, Tehran ATC had been attempting numerous times to contact the aircraft. The xxxxx apologised and remarked that Tehran ATC were not truthful that numerous attempts had been made to contact the aircraft. Recent events highlighted some worrying behaviour. Upon decent into Dubai (OMDW), clearance was given to descend to 9000 ft. Upon levelling out, the airspeed was 260 knots. The xxxxx was prompted to slow the speed down to 250 knots. The reply was along the lines of \u201c250 knots is only a recommendation, the limitation is only 5000 ft\u201d. After an ill-timed and uncomfortable exchange, the xxxxx begrudgingly reduced the speed to 250 knots. On final approach into Dubai, tower instructed that after landing vacate at V6. Auto brakes 3 was then selected to allow for the best chance to make the rapid exit. Upon landing the xxxxx applied excessive braking, to the extent which would cause passenger anxiety. \u201cI have control\u201d was commanded twice before a more aggressive tone had to be used for the xxxxx to completely relinquish control. The braking by the xxxxx was excessive and unnecessary. Deadheading crew remarked after landing that the deceleration was quite uncomfortable. 562 On several occasions NCC disturbed me on my days OFF without having volunteer to fly on the day. There where occasions when they called me at 0200 in the morning. This has to stop ASAP. We are working on just the minimum days off in a calendar month and instead of the company tackling the actual problem of hiring more pilots they are trying to over work us and get the job done on minimum crew. Days OFF for us are precious and we need time to relax and spent time with our families. 563 DXB-MED Dubai to Madinah, Saudi Arabia Unable to sleep and have been awake for most of the night. Possible causes are roster, kids and recent events. 565  Fatigued due to impossible change in my body clock. I came home after flight around 00:30LT (01/april). Went to bed at 01:00LT, slept 8h, woke up at 09:00LT. Normal person can sleep naturally after being awake 14h-16h. I had a standby starting at 22:00 which is the time the body need to go sleep. My duty could be extended until 14:15LT which would mean being awake for 29h. Also, after this duty which finishes at 04:01LT the next duty starts at 05:30LT next day which means another 24h body clock change.  This means 2 body clock changes in just 2 days. This is poor rostering, specially if it is occurring while having 1 day OFF in 11 days period.  570 MUX-DXB Multan, Pakistan, to Dubai Having operated 2 disrupted duties in as many shifts, one being an 18.5 hour duty, which did have the follow duty removed, and then subsequently operating the next assigned duty, i found myself to be extremely tired.  The second duty entailed being 1:37hr in discretion, as the result of a turn back to dubai and then doing our utmost to assist in trying to get the flights done. Sign off in Dubai was 11:17 local. My original roster had me with stby starting at 2000 local. as a result of our delayed return to DXB this was changed to a 0100-0600 stay. When I went to sign the discretion report I informed crewing that I would probably be calling fatigued later in the day if this was to be held.  I did not want to cause any more problems than needed, just wanted to highlight that I was exhausted and if I was unable to get sufficient rest this would be the case.  We came to a solution where i helped by picking up a KHI duty with report of 0650 local on 01/04, thus given me every chance to get some decent rest and be fit to fly, which I was.  Prior to operating the rescheduled/delayed 339/340 the discretion and fatigue issues were discussed by both myself and fellow flight crew and also with the cabin. At no point did I force anyone to do something they did not want to do. The FO elected to continue, as he could see that by doing so we were doing our bit to try and help out. the cabin crew were not too enthused by running this late, and when given the option to change to a shorter duty with an earlier finish this was taken up. It should be noted that NCC did explore many options to try to mitigate our going into discretion, but were being met with resistance at every turn.  574 DXB-BGW Dubai to Baghdad, Iraq     Baghdad international airport. Photograph: Mohammed Ameen/Reuters    When we arrived at the a/c, the engineer was in the flight deck, and he said that he needed a few minutes to complete his checks. I asked him if the a/c needed a daily check, and he told me that he was doing it at that time. I asked him if he was alone and how much time he needed cause the flight was already delayed. He said that he was alone and needed about 25 minutes!!! When i spoke to Maintrol office, i asked the shift supervisor of how much time is needed for a daily check to be completed, and he told me about 1:30 hours for 1 man.  If the engineers are 2 or 3, half of that time or even less. So i questioned him how 1 engineer will perform a daily check and a turn around alone, in 25 minutes on our a/c. He said he will call us back.  Then the engineer came back to the flight deck and told us that he will not perform the daily check after all and they will push it for later on that day. So, if i wasn\u2019t questioning the maintrol, the engineer would have signed an incomplete daily check for our aircraft???  579 DXB-TRV Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram, India  Scheduled Duty - I would like to highlight the issues of potential fatigue concerning this particular duty and the circumstances which will impact crew. The duty 439/440 DXB \u2013 TRV \u2013 DXB starts at a report time of 1920, for me this followed a day off which is fine, however I normally wake at around 9am and it is difficult to get back to sleep before this duty reports although I tried at 3pm to sleep but circadian rhythms/sleep pattern prevented me from getting any additional sleep. Therefore by the time I reported I had been awake for 10 hours 20 mins. The duty to TRV is planned to arrive back at DXB at 0615 which realistically for me means 21 hours 15 minutes awake. In reality before we started this particular duty we were delayed 1 hour and then had a further tech delay of 4 hours plus which resulted in the crew operating outbound and positioning on the return which was a total duty of 1537. If the tech issue had of been resolved before the necessity to employ a further crew we could have left going into discretion which would have resulted in an extremely long day for all concerned. I appreciate that it is difficult to resolve the scheduling of this duty, however if it is scheduled on the second duty of a series of over night duties it might help in getting sufficient sleep to enable this duty to be completed with a greater degree of alertness/safety? 599 DXB-GYD Dubai to Baku, Azerbaijan Our operation to Baku currently has us on the ground for a scheduled time of 2 1/2 hours. We arrive at 0430 local dubai time and leave at 0700 local dubai time. This is the time when our body is at a circadian low, exactly the time when we should be sleeping. Unfortunately we cannot take proper rest in the aircraft and we are then faced with a 2.5 hour flight back to Dubai.  Having operated this flight last night I can testify to the fact that this mode of operation is extremely fatiguing for the entire crew.  When we arrived to the approach in Dubai the captain and I were both extremely tired as I\u2019m sure most of the crew usually is when operating this flight. When I asked Ops Control the reason for the extended ground time they said it was \u2018a commercial decision based on available slot times in Dubai and Baku\u2019. In light of the current issues we face in this company regarding fatigue and according the SMS chapter 2.5 I think it is pertinent that a re assessment is made of the impact on safety of this type of unnecessarily long ground times for this and other flights.  Besides the impact on safety, the extended ground time now also poses a security risk with our ACN security 2016-015 describing escalating tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Having an aircraft on ground any longer than necessary when our security department is issuing an ACN about the same region is, in my humble opinion, a risk.  602 DXB-SJJ Dubai to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina I was about to report for FZ761B (a requested flight), at 08:15 local, but due my last duty, finished at approx 06:55 local I was not able to get any sleep.  These nigh to day or day to night shifts, really meet up with my body clock in a way I can not get any rest.Its been quite difficult to me to get some rest, my body is taking longer to recover from night duties despite all my efforts (healthy diet, exercise, etc). A night shift disrupt my sleeping pattern in a way that affects my future duties even my days off. I\u2019ve been sick lately due an decrease of my body defenses mainly caused by not resting properly.  XXXXX It has come to my attention (by other colleagues) that capt xxxxx has a tendency to \u201ctouch\u201d the engine start levers in-flight at regular intervals. I have never met the Captain and never flown with him, therefore I can not confirm the aforementioned accusation. If this is not the case I apologize for reporting a colleague, but as this is a \u201chabit\u201d that relates to flight safety I\u2019d rather report it while there still time for corrective actions. XXXXX (Safety)Dubai I would like to report something that came to my attention for investigation and confirmation. A number of F/O have come across to inform me that a captain named xxxxx in short intervals taps the start levers in flight with different excuses every time and makes F/Os nervous. I have not seen this, but the fact that more than five F/Os confirmed it is very serious to make an investigation on the issue. 633  Due to having, in the last two days, day flights and landing yesterday at 22:30 Local time and finishing my duty at 23:00, I am unable to change my sleeping and rest patterns in order to report at 00:40 Local time.  I feel unrested and unfit to fly due to the pattern change, and I feel that it would be unsafe to work in this condition  661  I called fatigued for my night BAH (29) reporting at 23:55 as I hadn\u2019t had sufficient to rest prior to the 1630 cutoff. I finished my delayed MCT/KWI duty at 00.51 on the xxth and then was given 25 hours rest prior to my scheduled MCT(41) on 16th reporting at 0225. At 00.36 on 16th crew control called and told me I was now on a KWI reporting at 0125 giving me 49 minutes until my duty commenced! I felt tired but able to do the newly assigned KWI duty. I finished this duty at 0725 on 16th and only managed to sleep for 3 hours as my body clock was still based upon sleeping during the night \u2026 In light of this I called unfit due fatigue at 1615 as I felt I would not get sufficient rest prior to my duty commencing at 23.55.  I feel the main reason for my lack of rest and extreme tiredness is due to the 25 rest period switching me from a day pattern to a nights. 1 night I am going to bed at 2am 24 hours later I am reporting at 2am. It\u2019s a completely unworkable pattern and is extremely fatiguing, combined with an already high workload, 800+ hours a year with double that in duty, these are tiring in themselves and adding poor rostering with 18-30 rest periods is too much to ask.  670 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi Being standby for 11hrs 30min on the 14th and called out for a flight to SAW coming back after more than 1hr delay at 04:30 then having a KTM simulator the day after from 01:15 till 07:00, caused me to be exhausted, fatigued, need some night sleep and unable to fly another night flight which is KHI reporting at 23:30. 683 DXB-AHB Dubai to Abha, Saudi Arabia A Company Notam for the destination AHB was incorrect because referencing a FIR Notam that did not existed in the FIR notam section the topic was routing and procedure in the SCATANA Area. Upon request of clarification the dispatcher informed us that the referenced notam (A691/15) doesn\u2019t exist anymore and there is a new FIR notam with a different name, and after this verbal explanation we have been requested for the First time to proceed to the aircraft. I made clear that wasn\u2019t a good practice to leave with incorrect paperwork. The dispatcher then decided to hung up and come to talk to us in person explaining that probably from Nav services no one verified the notams and that Co Notam was expired long tome ago and the new FIR Notam regarding the SCATANA has been changed and no one adjusted the company notam. Once again, for the SECOND time, he requested us to proceed to the aircraft with the incorrect papers. I refused to do it without and adjustment to the briefing pack. shortly after i received a call from this number \u2026 trying to explain me what we already new, and for the THIRD time, if we could please proceed to the aircraft. It\u2019s then that i felt the need to explain that incorrect/illegal paperwork could be a serious finding in case of a Ramp inspection in any place and that myself as a PIC could be liable for accepting it so I said that i wanted an adjusted briefing pack. Only then they offered to send a written amendment via ACARS prior departure. One consideration to be added is that I was called from STBY at 4am (after 20 hours rest from my previous duty and after switching sleeping cycle 4 times in the preceding 7 days) and so was the FO after a busy week himself. weather was marginal around the area, and as a fact descending to FL240 we were in ICING condition and Stormy CLOUDS that were not mentioned on the Weather chart nor Engine Anti ICE was considered in the planned fuel consumption. All this said I thought was UNSAFE and Wrong to be put under all that pressure to leave on time without the serenity we should be entitled prior take people in the air.  686 DXB-DAC Dubai to Dhaka, Bangladesh Due to rostering and sleep disturbances i was unable to report for duty. 706 Called fatigue as I was unable to rest adequately in between alternating night/early morning duties. My last duty was a night HYD with reporting time of 1950 local on 21 Apr 2016. After reaching home from this duty I fell asleep around 0800 and woke up 1600.  I went to bed again at 1900 however I was unable to fall asleep and at 0100 I realised that I will be fatigued for my duty to KBL with a reporting time of 0310 on xx Apr 2016. I would\u2019ve been awake for almost 20 hours by the time I would be landing back in Dubai, I did not feel this would be safe.  707 KRT-DXBKhartoum, Sudan, to Dubai It has been repetitive during this month of April having more than ninety block time the last 28 days (not taking into account five additional simulator hours that happened on the 14th night that are not considered in the total block time computation).  With peaks of 96:08 on the 11th and 98:46 on The 19th. There were also changes in the scheduled flights/sims/duties that ended up in two additional STBY days that both were assigned for two different flights, EBL on the 15th and ASB on the 19th. When NCC called on last stand by to report to the ASB flight the Crew-Control Officer was noticed about me having already 93.5 hours before duty started on the last 28 days (with no mention about the additional 5 hours of the SIM), and it would turn into a 98.5 period, but no changes since I believe it was within legality. Today I started another 5 days duty period of day to night swap then minimum rest, and two evenings. After, a single day off to continue with another four days (finally one single day off in ten days duty). I am feeling fit to fly at the beginning of every duty, but in last months in some cases my performance drops dramatically even after asking for controlled rest periods (sometimes more than one in the same flight). I also try my best to manage my rest since at home the feeling of tiredness is continuous, but specially on swapping day/night/ \u2026 duties, trying to deal with a family life and having most of the times single days off, it is very difficult to find the way to sleep and rest appropriate time. 730 KWI-DWC Kuwait to Dubai Multiple mistakes due to fatigue conditions. On assigned service during all flight there was a number of situations like missing items on procedures, erratic actions, missing radio calls and feeling of tiredness and sleepy, although at the beginning of it I was feeling ok. All could be treated as low intensity, but finally so many mistakes can lead to an incident or even an accident. Things to take into account could be the roster: in the last 16 days an average of 93+ hours -considering the last 28 days- with peaks of more than 95hrs on six of those days.  Another one is that I was assigned for a long day 3-sector one, swapping next day into night and after, minimum rest for this evening duty.  This situation is getting worse with the time that is why I filled an ASR some days ago, and finally today in addition of this fatigue report, I called sick for my next duty. 735 DXB-COKDubai to Cochin, India Busy week with 5 long days in a row to include 3 multiple sector days. The last day was another 12 hour day door to door and reaching home just before midnight. Only 2 days off to be followed by a long 14hr day door to door. I woke up early morning around 7am as this is the rythem that the roster leading up to the fatigue call dictated. I tried to rest further in the day but was unable. Leaving me with insufficient sleep for the night flight planned. Long days followed by insufficient rest and a flip to a night flight is the cause for the fatigue. I felt very unrested after the 2 days off as the days leading up were so long. Then to do another 14 hour day and be rested enough for a night flip was always going to be tough.  763 DXB-TSE Dubai to Astana Duty Changes with short notice and rest planning I was originally scheduled to fly as A crew to TSE report time of 2010 local. At 1946 crew control called me an advised that I would have to operate both sectors. I pointed out to them that I was not sufficiently rested to do both legs as they were effectively doubling my duty. I was then told that I should always be rested to do both sectors and that crewing did not have enough crew to cover these flights. I then reiterated the point that I was not fit for such a large change in FDP and that I was only fit to fly a flight of similar FDP as the original A crew on the TSE. I was subsequently put on an MUX.  Despite the tone and manner I was spoken to on the phone, I think the key focus of this ASR is the safety issue that needs to be highlighted here. Crew cannot be expected to plan rest on what might happen. I was simply not fit to fly for that amount of FDP.  If the change had been given with sufficient amount of time to take additional rest then I would have been able to safely accept the change.  By crewing\u2019s logic all crews should be rested for any flight, to any destination, with any FDP and be able to accept the change at any time. This is simply not feasible, safe or wise. Furthermore, I would like clarification as to where in our manuals crewing are able to make these large changes to FDP at such short notice and more guidance on flying as A crew, B crew. Whilst small changes in report time or changes onto similar FDP flights are acceptable, no crew can be expected to safely accept changes of such large proportions.  765 CMB-DXB Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Dubai ASR was filed for exceeding 250kts below 5000ft. Safety Dept questioned if this could have been due to tiredness and/or fatigue. I consulted an AME Psychiatrist at the earliest possible time and he concluded that I am suffering from mental/physical fatigue. Probably caused from a Fatigue event in October 2015 and repeated sickness and tiredness since that time. Symptoms increasing until being hospitalised in February 2016 with Exhaustion. Annual Leave and Sickness Leave subsequent to the events failed to solve the fatigue. He recommended to take time off, to be advised by him directly to the Company. I am to attend again at the end of the period to see if further help is needed. Health 388 DXB-TBS Dubai to Tbilisi, Georgia AFTER 30 MIN OF FLIGHT THE SENIOR FLIGHT ATTENDANT INFORMED TO US WE HAD A MEDICAL ISSUE ON BOARD WITHIN A FEMALE PAX THAT WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE NORMALLY. \u2013 BLOOD PRESSURE REPORTED 70/40 AND THE PAX APPARENTLY HAVE EXPERIENCED DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS. WE CALLED THE MEDLINK AND ALSO ASKED FOR A DOCTOR ON BOARD FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE OF THE PAX. THE MEDLINK SAID TO PROVIDE ASPHIRIN, OXYGEN AND TO FLAT HER AND WAIT 10 TO 15 MIN TO CHECK HER BLOOD PRESSURE AGAIN. THE DOCTOR ON BOARD SUGGESTED TO DIVERSION, HOWEVER MEDLINK SUGGESTED TO WAIT. AFTER 15 MIN WE CALLED THEM BACK \u2013 THE PAX SITUATION WAS THE SAME AT THAT TIME \u2013 THE DOCTOR ON BOARD AND MEDLINK RECOMMENDED TO DIVERT. WE MADE A CONTACT WITH NCC \u2013 THEY ASKED TO INFORM OUR POSITION AND THE NCC INITIALLY SUGGESTED TO DIVERT TO OIFM OR OISS HOWEVER, WAIT FOR FINAL DECISION. SO, WE DECIDED TO HOLD OVER YZD (ONE HOUR WAY FROM DXB AND TWO HOURS WAY FROM TBS) AND IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY 40 MIN TO THE NCC AND MEDLINK TO INFORM US WHERE TO GO. AFTER OPT CHECK AND WEATHER CHECK WE REALIZED THAT THE OIFM WAS NOT AN OPTION AND OISS WAS PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED \u2013 WE WERE ALMOST 3 TONS ABOVE MLW AT THAT TIME. MEDLINK CALLED US BACK AND SAID THAT GOING BACK TO OMDB OR OKBK WOULD BE THE BEST OPTION. THUS, WE DECIDED TO TURN BACK AND PROCEED TO DXB.  XXXXX Tbilisi to Dubai Approx 1 hour prior to arriving in Dubai we were informed that a male passenger was suffering from a racing pulse, a condition for which he had seemingly been prescribed medication, but which he\u2019d unfortunately left within his jacked pocked, the jacket having been placed within his checked-in baggage (it being now located in the #1 cargo hold). A SatCom call was made to MedLink and the Doctors advice was for the gentlemen (and I kid you not) to purse his lips around his thumb and blow hard and / or to also effect a tensing of his stomach muscles (much as might occur during the act of defecation, I\u2019m not making this stuff, up, as that\u2019s what the Doctor advised), actions which we were assured should help to quell the gentlemen\u2019s racing heart. It transpired that a nurse was also onboard (albeit unfortunately without her formal ID), but she was nevertheless able to take the gentlemen pulse and also his blood pressure, all of which were alarmingly high. After a period of approx 15 minutes, during which the afore mentioned \u2018treatment\u2019 was enacted, the nurse again assessed the gentlemen\u2019s condition and it seemed that there had been little, if any, improvement. By this point we were in the descent in Dubai and it seemed that holding was likely at DESDI. So ATC were informed that we had sick passenger onboard and they asked if were we declaring an emergency? \u2026 and so, to avoid delay, a PAN call was made. UAE &amp; Dubai Approach / Tower / Ground controllers were their usual superlative best, providing us with particular expeditious routing. Top class stuff! DNATA &amp; FZ NCC were also contacted and advised that we had a sick passenger on board and a request was made for Paramedics to meet the aircraft, including a request for steps to be attached as soon as possible after our arrival on stand. All went swimmingly, that is until we arrived on stand only to then suffer a 2 minute delay, caused by no one from DNATA being available to drive the steps up to the aircraft. The gentlemen was eventually taken into the ambulance by the paramedics. We also recovered the gentlemen\u2019s suitcase from the #1 hold and were able to pass his medication to the paramedics. 461 IEV-DXBKiev to Dubai Change of PIC with deadheading crew from IEV  During the flight back from IEV in the last hour of the flight Captain decided to use the lavatory. at this time Fo xxxxx was in the cockpit so he acted as the cover crew while Capt. Stepped out. after just few seconds the Lavatory door was fully opened and I could see partially in the camera that Capt. is sitting there surrounded by 4 cabin crew members. at this point I found out that he is not feeling well and I called the Cabin Crew Via Interphone to ask for further detail. she Informed me that he is suffering a low blood Pressure. after assessing the situation I decided to ask for the Dead heading Pic to enter the cockpit so we can continue with the safe operation. He entered the cockpit and Informed me that He saw Capt. was not in good condition. as a joint agreement the call was made to NCC via Satcom and the decision was made so Captain yyyyyy continue as the PIC to complete the Flight. after 15 minutes Capt. entered the cockpit and declared he feels better and he wanted to switch again with Capt. yyyyy but he was offered to relax more in the business class until we land in DXB.  466 IEV-DXB Kiev to Dubai FZxxx had an inflight declared Pilot Incapacitation as per the following sequence of events: 1. Flight was dispacthed with 2 sets of flight crew (4 pilots) and 1 set of Cabin crew (5 Flight attendants). 1 set of flight crew deadheading on 1\u00b0 sector and operating on the way back and the other set vice versa. 2. FZxxx departed from IEV exercizing discrection due to delay on 1\u00b0 sector and flight departed without issues.  3. During flight, Captain ate a sandwich (purchased in FZ cafeteria) and felt a different taste that was not strange enough to alarm him in order to stop from eating it  4. One and half hour after this, approximately after passing abeam KWI (more or less 1 hour to ARR in DXB), Captain left the cockpit to go to toilet for phisiological needs. 5. In the toilet, Captain felt nausea and little dizziness that last for about 2 min. Captain called Cabin crew in front galley to assist him with a glass of water and a little amount of salt, just in case it could be a low pressure peak. Cabin crew offered a chocolate in case of low sugar level and was also accepted by the Captain. 6. Cabin crew started their procedures questioning Captain to assess the situation. Captain aswered all the questions and never fainted or lost consciousness. Just rested seated with the head up to avoid vomiting. After 3 minutes, Captain was felling 100% again, but remained in the toilet resting for more 2 minutes. 7. During the time spent in toilet, operating FO saw through security camera the Cabin Crew assisting Captain and called the deadheading Captain to replace him in the cockpit. 8. Deadheading Captain took controls 9. Captain now was feeling 100%, yet a little pale in the face but recovering and wanted to return to duty. Cabin crew insisted in take the blood pressure measurement first, which was accepted. Also asked Capt if wanted Medlink to be called, which had a negative answer from Captain, as he was felling fully recovered. 10. Pressure was obtained (9/5) and Captain said that usually his blood pressure is normally on the lower side and that was normal for him and he felt OK to return to duty. 11. Cabin crew insisted that Captain to rest a little more in bussiness class seat for 5 minutes, since there was another Captain in the cockpit and we had time as we were far from ARR. Captain accepted the suggestion to rest further 5 min to make sure he was able to return to duty. 12. As all this time Captain felt better and fully recovered, he decided to return to cockpit. 13. Captain entered the cockpit and informed deadheading Captain that he was fully recovered and could return to his duty. 14. Deadheading Captain insisted in an informal way that Captain should not be worry and could rest in the back. Captain, then, insisted in returning to duty when was informed that a \u201cdecision has been made and NCC already swaped the Captains\u201d 15. Captain accepted the decision and asked if he could stay in the observer seat from that moment onwards. Deadheahing Captain (in contols) agreeded and flight continued 16. During descent, it was informed that an ambulance was called upon arrival and Captain asked to cancell it, as he felt 100% and it was unnecessary in his opinion. Ambulance was canceled. 17. ATC asked if FZxxx wanted to call for emergency, but operating crew said \u201cno\u201d and flight continued uneventful till landing.  18. After landing Captain went upstairs to NCC to ask the reason for NCC decision to swap Captains, and only at that time Captain was informed that deadheading Captain had declared \u201cPilot Incapacitation\u201d and NCC was only informed about the scenario. Because of that, NCC coordinated priority for landing for FZxxx 19. Captain returned downstairs and meet the crew for debriefing 20. Captain was initially removed from next duty and put on SICK till next morning meeting with Flight Operations Representatives 723 DXBDubai \u2013 not specified During cruise the senior cabin crew called the flight deck and informed there was a lady on board not feeling well. She was 85 years old and experienced a shortness of breath and vomiting, senior informed us that he was going to call medlink. A few minutes later the senior came to the flight deck and informed us that the satcom mobile phone did not have a signal, so he explained the state the passenger was in and gave us the medlink form. I told him to go check on the passenger while I tried to contact medlink. It took a while to get hold of medlink, after the first contact the line got broken, on the third attempt we got a good connection with medlink.  Just before we were able to connect to medlink, the senior called us back and informed us that the passenger had stopped breathing and they could not find the pulse, so they had actioned CPR, the automated external defibrillator was showing no life, shock not recommended. They also had a doctor onboard which was assisting them. We shortly after got hold of MEDLINK and explained the situation, they advised us to continue to KHI while doing CPR, and said the doctor should give the adrenaline shot. All this was going on around in KHI FIR, around position LATEM, and we declared mayday and got highspeed and vectors into KHI. I was informed the crew performed CPR for approximately 45minutes, unfortunately the passenger could not be saved. The cabin crew did a very professional job and their teamwork was outstanding. We had a talk on the ground in KHI about the experience and how they were feeling, everyone was fit to fly home.  XXXXX Dubai to Khartoum this report is written in Colaboration eoth SCCM On flight 633 from DXB-KRT on AC A6-FEI, a xxxxx passenger seated in xxxxx complained to CCM about chest pain and shortness of breath and difficulty breathing at approx 0638z (1:38 hours onto the flight). The SCCM and CCMs found three doctors on board who then assisted in providing Oxygen and assistance to the passenger. Flight crew was informed of situation in a timely manner. SCCM then was to contact Medlink as per policies and procedures and get authorization as demanded by the doctors on board, whom stated at the xxxxx passenger was \u2018more than 85% chance of having a stroke\u2019. The symptoms were once again shortness of breath, chest pain, no medications or previous medical history. If the SCCM and CCM did not help and allow access to the EMK he would take legal action and sue the crew and airline. Passenger was moved to J class third row. We informed the Doctor that we had to get clearance from Medlink to open and dispense any drugs in flight to the passenger. At this point the Captain made the call to Medlink via NCC as the hand help telephone was not working properly and hence the flight crew had to call from the flight deck. At approximately 0655z we contacted Medlink via phone patch (case # BMDC071174) with NCC and stated the above facts. In the meantime due to pressure and threats from the Doctor on board, the CCM gave a copy of the list of items in the Emergency fly away medical kit. The doctor said that he wanted to dispense item number 15- Nitrolingual spray 400 mcg to the patient.  We established the call with Medlink and were told that due to his age and no previous history, to give him two paracetamol tablets and continue the oxygen. The call was then dropped at 0703z. Called back at 0705z. At 0713z the Doctor then demanded to speak to me on the intercom. He stated that it was an 85% chance that the passenger was having a heart attack. I listened to him. He stated that if we did not take action that he would sue all of the crew and myself and the company as we were \u2018not doing anything to help the man\u2019. I stated that we were all following company policy and procedures and needed to get clearance and medical advise from Medlink. It was my responsibility as the Captain to follow these procedures. He then continued to talk over me. I simply asked him if he would allow me to talk. I asked three times and then he hung up on me! I asked the SCCM to tell him that I simply needed the vital signs of the passenger so that I could then make another call to Medlink via NCC. He delayed this process by being rude and hanging up on the Captain. At 0722z we were updated with the vital signs (BP 130/85 and a pulse of 82) and was told that pain was increasing. At 0726z Medlink authorized the Crew to let the Doctor on board give one tablet/spray to the passenger and all if condition worsened. At 0732z we were informed by the SCCM and the Dr that medication was given and should be \u2018fine\u2019 in a few minutes. At 0740z passenger was \u2018fine\u2019.  In range to KRT destination preventive medical assistance was requested from KRT tower. At 0857z we landed and were on blocks at 0902z. Medical personnel boarded and examined passenger, and stated he was fine and would further examine him at their facilities and request him to go see a medical doctor. He disembarked via high lift and then went with medical personnel in ambulance. He further argued with personnel on the ground. The assisting Dr________ left via the high lift with his elderly family member that had requested a wheel chair. Captain called Medlink and gave them update of above statement and added the fact at the passenger was overweight and not in shape for the record. NCC was also called and stated operation was n  Lasers360 DXB-KHIDubai to Karachi On final approach into KHI ILS 25L at 2nm from the runway on our left side approx 2nm away a bright white serach light was pointed at the aircraft and tracked us to the runway. It was intense enough to not look at directly. KHI ground comtrol was informed and they said they would take appropriate measures. 371 KWI-DXBKuwait to Dubai On approach RW30L DXB a green laser light was shone at the aircraft from the left side. The area was identified as in the vicinity of Academic City. ATC advised.  398 DXB-KHIDubai to Karachi Green laser light shone deliberately at our aircraft on the approach into Karachi. The issue was raised with ATC (Karachi Approach) who said they would investigate the matter further.   441 DXB-KHIDubai to Karachi On final ILS25L in KHI, between 1500ft and 500ft AGL, a green laser pointed the cockpit several times. The position from which the beam flashed was approximately 3NM from IQA (ILS 109.7), 0.5NM left of RWY25L extended centerline. This information was reported to Karachi TWR. No further problems encountered. 522 DXB-TIF Dubai to Taif On approach to Taif almost intercepting the fila approach a Laser beam was pointed at the aircraft form a bi building all lit up by LED decorative lights. the laser did\u2019t enter the flight deck but was clealy pointed at the fuselage. Birds and drones380 ALA-DXBAlmaty, Kazakhstan, to Dubai After T/O from DXB,we were flying the RIKET SID. When we passed 10000\u201d we heard a loud impact sound from the left side of the fuselage. After this, we recognized it was a high altitude bird strike. We checked all the systems, engines parameters and the pressurization and we decided to continue our flight towards HYD and where we landed safely, uneventfully. On the stand we inspected the bird impact with my F/O and after that we called maintroll and techlog entry was taken. Maintroll dispatched the aircraft to home base. Return flight to DXB was uneventfull.  409 LKO-KTMChaudhary Charan Singh international airport, India, to Kathmandu, Nepal Suspected Birdstrike on final approach at approx. 1.000 ft AGL. Approach continued. All parameters normal. Birdstrike inspection carried out after landing iaw AMM. NIL findings, no evidence of damage, engine core ingestion and no change in engine parameters. ADD raised for re-inspection at base DWC.  416 KDH-DXBKandahar, Afghanistan, to Dubai We were in the short final at altitude 300ft agl when an unidentified bird hit the fuselage above windshield. No visible damage. Marked on the tech log.   426 KHI-DXBKarachi to Dubai Hit large raptor like bird on departure from rwy 25L in KHI. No parameter shift on indications. After landing large dent on no 1 engine Nacelle. Tech log entry made an main troll informed. 538 DXB-BEY Dubai to Beirut At approx 300\u2019 on approach runway 16 a flock of birds were seen flying across the approach path. An go-around/missed approach was initiated with the intent of avoiding flying through in the event of a continued landing. On initiation of the go-around at least one bird was hit, altitude approx 400\u2019. During the missed approach, on level off with autopilot engaged the autopilot failed to capture the set altitude. A manual correction to this was made and. Autopilot reconnected. We were then told to plan ILS 17. We subsequently set up and flown as planned. However, when cleared to intercept, we failed to get a LLZ capture. We were quizzed by ATC, and told them we were correcting, only to have the same thing happen a second time. At this time we asked servicibility of the ground unit, to be told it was not active. We elected to break off the approach and requested to fly ILS16. A runway inspection was carried out, we planned and flew the approach with no further complications. On inspection of aircraft after landing there was observed a considerably dent to the random right hand side. Inspection requested by approved personnel, and aircraft was deemed AOG.  541 DAC-DXB Dhaka to Dubai During takeoff from RW14 in DAC after V1 during rotation we experienced a bird strike on ENG #1. Heavy smell of burned bird felt in the cockpit and during climb engine vibration was experienced up to 3.8. High engine vibration NNC performed and thrust reduced to to minimum acceptable. Vibration always kept below 3.0 during the rest of the flight. NCC was contacted and decition to continue to Dubai was made. CC informed and NITS briefing performed. Safe continuation of the flight and safe landing performed in DXB.  591 DYU-DXB Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to Dubai At liftoff from RW09 a white object was seen passing the left window and shortly after a smell of cooking. A bird strike was suspected and engine parameters regularly observed during the climb. All was normal and the flight continued to DXB without event. The tower at DYU were informed of a suspected bird strike and a tech log entry made on arrival in DXB.  444 KDH-DXBKandahar to Dubai a drone flying straight and level was observed flying parallel to runway 30L in dubai at 3 miles on final segment to the left side, 1000 feet height, lateral separation around 100 meters from the airplane; surroundings of mirdiff. ATC was informed and aircraft performed a normal approach besides that. 630 DXB-DYU Dubai to Dushanbe  On final approach to Rwy 09 (radar vectors) we heard a quite distinct noise in the flight deck. On PDI we found trace of a confirmed bird strike on the radome and we suspected bird ingestion by the right engine. We didn\u2019t see any changes on the engine parameters nor smell any funny burnt odor form the conditioning system. The suspect was due some trace that could not be properly identified on the engine cowl and on one of the fan blades during the PDI. Picture were taken and sent to maintrol. They organized the assistance of a qualified engineer that performed a thorough inspection to the aircraft and signed of the aircraft with a one off authorization.  659 HGA-DXB Hargeisa, Somalia, to Dubai BIRDS OBSERVED ON BACK TRACK FROM HGA. REQUESTED BIRD SCARING PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM RW06. BIRDS STILL OBSERVED TOWARDS THRESHOLD OF RW24 AND BELIEVED WE HAD A STRIKE ONCE AIRBORNE. IMMEDIATE SMELL OF BURNT MEAT AND NUMBER 1 ENGINE SHOWED VIBRATION OF UP TO 1.5 UNITS. ALL OTHER PARAMETERS NORMAL SO FLIGHT CONTINUED TO DUBAI. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY INSPECTION IN DUBAI AND BIRD STRIKE CONFIRMED ON THE NUMBER 1 ENGINE WITH DAMAGE FOUND TO THE NUMBER 12 N1 BLADE WITH POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO OTHERS. BIRD PARTS SEEN IN INLET AND EXHAUST AREA OF ENGINE. UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE. Disruptive behaviour 363 VCBI-OMDB Colombo to Dubai Just after pushing back from the stand and as we were about to start engines, the SCCM called from the cabin and informed us that a passenger is shouting at the cabin crew very loudly and appears to be heavily drunk.  I immediately got the push back stopped and got the aircraft pulled back into the stand in coordination with Colombo ground.  I asked for immediate presence of Police at the gate. The passenger was escorted out of the aircraft by police and his hand baggage plus his checked baggage removed from the cargo hold. I ordered a new and complete safety and security check of the aircraft by the cabin crew along with identification of each hand bag by individual passengers. After the completion of security procedures the flight was commenced and completed without any further disruption. NOTE: I was told by senior on return to Dubai was that the cabin crew did notice this passenger being drunk while boarding but they did not bother informing the captain. Please investigate that why such an obvious drunk passenger got through the check in gate and then into the aircraft?? The cabin crew must be advised to be vary of such passengers and they MUST bring any unusual happening to the notice of captain in time. This disruption could have been avoided by efficient checking at gate and/ or at least while boarding. 449 DXB-JEDDubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Go Around at aprox 2000 due to cabin no longer being secure.  Pax got up and went to the toilet, was repeatedly asked to return to seat as we were about to land, and chose to ignore all instructions from cabin crew and general P.A made bt me from the flight deck Go around was carried out after confirming with cabin crew cabin was no longer secure. Resequenced and carried out subsequent approach to land with n o further issues. Security was requested to meet the aircraft on stand, and passenger was dealt with by them. 382 URKK-OMBD Krasnodar to Dubai The flight was Initially delayed out of Dubai due to boarding and ATC. Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR [Krasnodar] a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft\u2019s wings would need de-icing due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers. During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the multi-cultural mix of the crew and said \u2018why aren\u2019t there more Russian crew on the flight?\u2019 The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn\u2019t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^&amp;. Truffles/brakes/turbulence/dogs362 OIKB-OMDBBandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai While taking off from OIKB significantly more elevator was required to unstick the nose for rotation than is normally needed. Once rotation was achieved, the yoke felt very heavy and I (FO) used stabilizer trim to ease the elevator force. Once my flaps were up the trim indicated 10.3 units of nose up trim. During the rotation, the yoke travel felt very close to full travel to achieve the proper rotation rate. I gave control to the captain so he could evaluate the situation and he agreed that there was a serious imbalance in the aircraft. The flight controls felt normal and it was determined that it must be an issue with the cargo load. Other than the abnormal trim required the aircraft flew normally and we continued to DXB.  The Loadsheet indicated there were 3400 Kg of Truffles loaded. 600 kg in C2 and 2800 kg in C3 with 24 bags in C4. The picture attached shows where all the cargo and bags were located in the aft pit. It does not look like there was 2800 kg of truffles in C3. and the bags were not secured in C4. This condition may have led to the nose heavy CG. The forward pit was pretty close to being bulked out so I did not include a picture. After landing we contacted NCC and asked that someone come out and verify the load. In the Picture attached of C3 there was no cargo or bags aft of what you see in the picture. 393 DXB-JUB Dubai to Juba, South Sudan Marshalling at Juba After landing, we backtracked and vacated runway 13 via taxiway C. Marshaller was insight and i taxied the airplane to position for parking in accordance with marshaller guidance.  As i approached the parking area i noticed that the marshaller is guiding us onto a parking position that would cause us to maneuver the airplane outside protected area and expose part of the port wing outboard of engine #1 to rest over active service road in front of fire station. I could not accept parking in the position given by the marshaller because due to the following reasons: (Please refer to attached photos in pdf) 1. Port wing would be resting over active service road used by vehicles and equipment (risk of collision) 2. Very tight maneuvering will be required to taxi out of the given parking position for the next crew and movement over unprotected surface will be involved (wingtip clearance during the turn) 3. Close proximity to fire station which in case of any required emergency movement can cause difficulty for fire trucks movement (restricted paved surface). Both myself and the First Officer requested the marshaller several times using hand signals to move slightly inwards into the apron but he insisted that we should taxy towards his position. After trying for about 5 minutes with him without success i requested in coordination with ATC to turn and park at current position, taking into consideration that we would not be blocking any aircraft or personnel movements or cause any issues to other aircrafts or ATC After shutdown i requested to speak with the marshaller. When i met him he was upset and did not even want to listen to my explanation commenting stuff like \u201che is in charge\u201d and i should follow his marshaling instructions \u201cwithout asking or questioning\u201d and that \u201cwhen i am in Juba i should follow his rule\u201d. He claimed that we blocked other aircraft which was certainly not the case as movement on the apron went on as normal including large Antonov aircraft movement. Since the conversation was not going anywhere i informed him that i will be filing an ASR detailing the incident. I would also like to reiterate that the same issue occurred on my previous flight to Juba but the marshaller at the time was more cooperative allowing us to park as requested. Incidentally: When i was trying to take photos of the parking position of Flydubai aircraft I was stopped by security saying that i am not allowed to take any photos and i will be risking detention if i do so again. I hope the above report can contribute to safer operation at Juba airport  DXB-ELQDubai to Gassim, Saudi Arabia Pilot flying forgot to release the parking brake for takeoff. Config warning sounded, brakes released, normal takeoff followed.  442 MCT-DXBBuraidah, Saudi Arabia, to Dubai  Qatar Airways refuelling during thunderstorm Qatar airways A320 parked next to our plane was refuelled during a thunderstorm with lightning over the airfield. I was waiting for the storms to pass but the Qatar plane didnt. When I questioned the captain his response was he just needed a quick 500kg, thinking that it would be ok. The fuel company al maha when questioned said that the captain had requested it so they had to do it. I felt this was a very unsafe thing to do and they had no real understanding of the potential implications of the situation. I delayed over 45 minutes before myself and the first officer felt it was safe to refuel our plane.  465 DWC-DXBDubai World Central to Dubai Hi Kind of a bad approach in KTM yesterday. It started out by ATC wanting us to do a VOR to rwy 02. Wind was reported 190/17 kts. We can only do 10 kts tail wind in ktm. We asked for a circling, but with the option to land on RWY 02 when we came down to minima and the wind was below 10 kts. On final KTM wanted us to circle to the right of the rwy, we several times told them that we can only do circling to the left of the rwy. So busy on the radio, coming down the path. We did turn left at KTM 2 miles, hdg 337 for 20 sec, then hdg 022, abm the threshold timing was done at 10 sec (not 15, due to tailwind), we had to stay within the 4 nm circle of KTM. I started descend, disconnected AP/AT and continued descend. We had one bank angle and 2 sink rate aural warnings. We were fully VMC so I continued. The approach leaves you 3 times high than a normal 3deg. ILS app. At one mile from the rwy on the circling app you are at 800 somthing feet, on a normal ILS you would be at 300 feet. On the VOR to 02 KTM we do get glideslope warning the last 2.5 nm if we increase our rate of descent, and thats normal in KTM. Now I could see that we where high, but was not expecting to have that steep angle to the rwy. So rate of descent was high, and triggered the aural sink rate twice. I don\u2019t see how that app can be flown without getting the warning or at least close to getting it. Its steep, its close to the mountains, and its an approach I have only done once in the sim 4-5 years ago. I was not comfortable doing it. A sink rate warning can be disregarded if you are VMC and comfortable to continue, but we did get it close 300 feet also. This really bugs me, either is was late starting my descent, we where to close or something else. We should probably have done a go around, but that would have ended up in a diversion and a layover somewhere. (I know thats not an excuse, but its still in your mind somewhere when making your split second decision) Its a complex situation and you know you will get yelled at from the company if that would be the case. I would like your response to the incident and your thoughts on that app, am I the only one with this view or has other people raised their concern etc. Next time the offer a circling to RWY 20 I will probably decline, and rather diverte. Its not worth it..  480 DXB-BGWDubai to Baghdad ASR ATC Baghdad Wind 130/12 vis 10k m Baghdad ATC AND tower We asked for runway 33R but our request were denied. We asked for the reason why we could not land 33R and ATC replied due to tailwind. We inform them that the current wind was 10kts tail wind and that we can accept up to 15kt tailwind. The ATC asked us why we are forcing to land in bad weather and that they know about our accident and they are worried for us. When we finally got ILS 33R the tower switched off the ILS and told us we have to land runway 15L because the ILS is not available. We then asked for the VOR 33R it was approved but later on the tower turn the ILS back on again and told us that the ILS is now available, however we reclined and continued the VOR approach for runway 33R. The workload became high since the Tower denied our request and kept disturbing us with different type of clearances. Also the statement from ATC that the knew about a our accident and they were worried for us made both me and the FO very uncomfortable to the point we started to get worried about the approach.  489 DXB-KWIDubai to Kuwait Severe turbulence encounter during descent  During descent to Kuwait and at FL300 between positions SOLEM and KUMBO we encountered severe turbulence for duration of approximately 1 minute, the instruments were completely unreadable. During the entire flight we had encountered moderate turbulence en-route due to weather and Jetstream presence. Supplementary procedure for Turbulence was applied and request for descent made to Bahrain, passing through FL250 the turbulence subsided. Tech log entry was made, refer FDR02323 and MCC organized maintenance inspection by external engineer from NAS in Kuwait. Thorough inspection was made and aircraft was cleared. Nothing further to report  511 VKO-DXB Moscow, Russia, to Dubai Severe Clear Air Turbulence  While cruising at FL370 over Iranian airspace, approximately near to waypoint GODNA, in clear VMC, no weather radar return ahead and nearby, a rapid onset of severe turbulence occurred from steady flight condition with abrupt increase in airspeed quickly towards MMO, and pitch up onset estimated up to 10 degrees. I was PF (Captain), i disconnect A/P and A/T; due to severe turbulence and extreme bumping no mode control panel selection was possible to engage so i disregarded F/D inputs left on VNAV PATH. Expeditious pitch attitude and thrust correction where made to try to remain within flight envelope. Aircraft was uncontrollable at time for 10-15 seconds every now and then. Total duration probably around one and half minute. Request descend to lower level cause not possible to keep altitude and difficult control on roll as well. Seat belt sign was turned ON as the onset occurred. After around 1 and half minutes able to regain complete control of aircraft and level at FL350. At the onset of the severe turbulence we were flying at FL370, while the OFP was planned at FL390 and at that moment the MAX cruise level reported by the FMC was FL395 due buffet limitation. On top of that we choose to keep a lower cruise speed of Mach .78 compared to the ECON suggested by the FMC of .789. No report of turbulence was received and encountered and shear on OFP was showing 3 to 1, while wind was steady at around 270/85k. Plane didn\u2019t went in MMO (no clacker sounded) and remain at time sligltly above lower amber band, but was very difficult to control around all axis with abrupt speed variations of +- 20 kts and excursion of pitch up and down of more than +-5 degrees. Speedbrake use momentary not to exceed MMO. PM did a very good support calling all deviations and coordinating with ATC. No nearby aircarft was flying at the moment. With aircraft now under control, an assessment was done, A/P and A/T engaged and cruise speed of mach .76 selected. Cabin crew were contacted to assess their situation as well as the passengers.  Nobody was hurt but scare was among passenger. I made a PA to reassure the passengers explaining that the situation was under control. Rest of the flight went uneventful. Tech log entry for severe turbulence made upon arriving in DXB and maintroll advised. ATC advised later other aircrafts about the CAT.  523 OMDB-OAKB Dubai to Kabul Lost comms into Afghanistan  All flights into and out of Afghani airspace constantly fly without being in communication with the relevant station. Speaking to an air traffic controller working for Kabul approach who happened to be on our flight, this has been an issue for a long time and is due to some transmitters being out of fuel. See NOTAM A142/16 and A228/16. A simple refueling of these booster stations would prevent any incident where an aircraft might be out of radio-range and has a problem which requires immediate assistance. Consider the high terrain in the area. Problems persist on the GADER-OGOGO route portion and the LAJAK-GIDOG route portion.  There must be an easy solution would could avert a possible accident. 625 MHD-DXB Mashhad, Iran, to Dubai pack of 5 big dogs at taxiway b just after the main apron in mashad airport, we have informed the tower, which told us the dogs were not going to be a threat for our airplane and that a runway inspection was just carried out and runway was clear; i think they might have trained the dogs not to move while airplanes are in movement at that location! There is a fence in the perimeter of the airdrome, and i believe the dogs are tenants there. Yes, it is a joke; to receive such communication from the tower, never assuring that the animals were going to be removed from there. 654 DXB-SKT Dubai to Sialkot, Pakistan Whilst doing my welcome on board PA with the aircraft almost ready to depart, a passenger approached the cabin crew and asked why the Captain announced he was going to SKT and not Karachi as per his ticket. Passenger ticket indeed confirmed a booking for FZ331 to Karachi on the same day. FZ331 leaves 15 minutes after FZ337 to SKT. flydubai ground staff, NCC and police informed and the passenger was offloaded together with his 2 checked in bags. Cabin crew asked to search around the area where the passenger was seated and identify the hand baggage in the area\u2019s overhead lockers. Flight took another 30 minutes delay as a result of this. The passenger explained that he bought the ticket last minute at the flydubai reservations desk in T2. 668 ODS-DXB Odessa, Ukraine, to Dubai While refueling the aircraft, I noticed 6 large wooden boxes being loaded into Compartment 3. Each box took 4-5 big men to lift it. After fueling I checked the hold &amp; found that all boxes had been grouped together at the front of the compartment and were not evenly distributed. Even more worryingly, none of these boxes were fastened to the aircraft. I asked for them to be lashed down, and on checking found a man tying a rope around the group of boxes, but still no netting or other equipment to contain the load! The effect of this load moving in the climb out or in flight doesn\u2019t bear thinking about!!!  399 DXB-TIF Dubai to Taif Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication  Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication. Contributing Factors: Busy avoiding weather before FIR entry. Missed frequency change from Bah 127.525 (not sure if occured). Both myself and FO believed we were in contact with Jeddah but actually we had not checked inFinally heard Jeddah 133.800 call us on guard. Checked in and immediately apologised regarding the confusion. On the return 878 we contacted Jeddah and he stated that everthing was fine.  414 DXB-OAI Dubai to Bagram, Afghanistan Drifting slightly into Iranian airspace to avoid weather  When we were approaching reporting point NADSO on airway B505, we had thunderstorm cells overhead NADSO and the south side of our route at flight level 290. We requested a higher level to avoid this weather, but it was not possible due to traffic. We knew that Iranian airspace was quite close to the airway from looking at our route charts (we were flying with aircraft A6-FDT which has no installed ipads) and that point, the only way we could avoid flying into a very bad thunder storm cell, was to turn north. We got approval from muscat to avoid weather and head northbound.  We did our best to estimate the EXACT location of the Iranian boundary from observing the route chart, and attempted to stay as close as possible to the correct airway and at the same time maintain safe flying conditions.  Immediately after passing this thunder storm cell, we measured the distance on the route map with a plotter and became aware that we had been in Iranian airspace maximum 5 miles. We also confirmed the same with Muscat control. Tehran air-defense or control did not call us on 121.5 frequency at any time.  No further actions were made in this case.

Crews complain about fatigue and potentially dangerous schedules at a leading budget airline, which is already under pressure following a crash on 19 March that killed 62 passengers and crew. A bomb scare at 30,000ft, multiple bird strikes, being shone at by lasers, drunken passengers, medical emergencies \u2013 and a pilot who forgot to disengage the handbrake during take-off \u2013 are also among more than 400 air safety reports written by pilots at Flydubai during March and April of this year.   Related: Flydubai flight records \u2013 the leaked documents    One pilot at the airline, which operates across the Middle East, Europe, Asia and Africa, said: \u201cThe company is losing the confidence of pilots, and I can feel and see it when I\u2019m flying with colleagues.\u201d Another claimed that the number of hours he was expected to work was potentially illegal. He wrote: \u201cI SAY AGAIN. ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u2026 THIS IS LEADING IN A EVEN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION.\u201d Flydubai said it had \u201cnever and would never ask its crew to operate outside legally permitted hours\u201d. The airline said that prevailing winds had extended the flight time in this particular case, but that there was no infringement of flying rules. \u201cFlydubai\u2019s first priority is safety. We operate to the highest standards,\u201d the spokesperson said.     A Flydubai flight crashed at Rostov-On-Don, Russia, in March. Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock    The Guardian has seen the air safety reports of 413 Flydubai flights written in the two-month period. In more than 40 reports, pilots describe concerns about fatigue. In some cases they complain about being urged to work overtime \u2013 so-called \u201cdiscretion\u201d flying \u2013 when they have warned it could be unsafe to do so. The air safety reports also refer to incidents where, it is claimed:  One pilot\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d flying technique was criticised by an angry colleague who expressed serious concerns following a particularly harsh \u201cbounced\u201d landing.   A pilot conceded his plane had become uncontrollable and increased speed sharply during a period of severe turbulence.    A senior member of crew was reprimanded after falling asleep in business class during a flight \u2013 and nodding off again after he was woken.   A pilot complained his aircraft was unstable because 2,800kg of truffles had been placed in the wrong luggage compartment.  In March, Flydubai flight 981 from Dubai to Rostov-on-Don in Russia crashed in bad weather as it approached the airport, killing 55 passengers and seven crew \u2013 the airline\u2019s first fatal accident. In the aftermath, a number of theories were put forward to explain the incident, including pilot error and possible fatigue among the crew. The plane was flying in darkness during a storm which had forced the crew to circle the airport for two hours. An investigation into the exact causes is ongoing.           FlyDubai air crash kills 62 in Russia \u2013 video report    \u2018Extremely dangerous\u2019 Documents seen by the Guardian suggest some pilots feel they are being pushed too hard and are struggling to recover from punishing day and night flight schedules. One pilot wrote: \u201cIt is unsafe and unhelpful for crewing to continually ask the crew to go into discretion especially after the crew have said they don\u2019t feel safe to continue into discretion. Once the crew have made the statement \u2026 it should be taken as set in stone and not something to try and whittle away at! No one wants to cause additional delays, disruption and end up at an out station. If we felt safe to continue to Dubai we would have done so!\u201d He added: \u201cIt is unacceptable to apply pressure, however pleasantly it is done, trying to sweet talk a crew into doing something they have said they feel is unsafe is unprofessionally and extremely dangerous!\u201d The exasperation reflected in the documents is compounded when another pilot questions why Flydubai asks him for the names of crew members who refuse to extend their normal working hours into so-called discretion flying. \u201cI also have issue with the fact that [they] initially only had one concern and that was to obtain the names of those crew member(s) that considered not exercising their right to use discretion. This is irrelevant. I can only assume it was for unsavoury reasons and is poor practice that should be quashed by management.\u201d The airline said it only asked for the names of crew members when it was necessary to update schedules to ensure \u201ccrew has sufficient rest after the flight\u201d. Another pilot said he had been under \u201cextreme pressure\u201d since the crash and felt he was unable to return to work because he could not fly safely.     A Flydubai Boeing 737-800 on the tarmac at Dubai airport. Photograph: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images    But the documents suggest pilots who say they are too tired to work place a heavier burden on those still flying.  In the days after the March crash, a crew member noted: \u201cIn times like this where we are experiencing extreme disruption, it\u2019s easy to forget about limits, but they are there for a reason. We are often rostered close to the limit anyway, and the crewing department do need to be careful with what they are asking people to do.\u201d The variety of situations that pilots have to deal with are laid bare by other air safety reports. During one flight to Kiev in March, a passenger told the crew he had planted a bomb on board. The pilot wrote: \u201cHe was Russian, we were just entering Ukraine, he was very verbal about being a Putin supporter \u2013 do the maths!\u201d The plane landed and was surrounded by 200 special forces and military personnel, who wanted the pilot to order an emergency evacuation of the passengers. \u201cAt this point i had to refuse, since the whole situation was a getting a bit ridiculous. As i told them, we had been sitting on the taxi way for over 30 minutes \u2013 if there had been a bomb on board, it would most probably have been detonated already!!\u201d The pilot ordered a normal disembarkation and no bomb was found on the flight.   Related: How to contact the Guardian securely    The Guardian showed details from the documents to a senior captain and aviation safety expert who currently works for a European airline. The specialist, who asked to remain anonymous, said there were \u201ca higher number of fatigue reports than I would expect\u201d. He suggested the reports following the March crash could be \u201cindicative of a belief in the pilot group that fatigue could well have played a part in the accident\u201d. \u201cThe fatigue reports feature a significant number of complaints of both poor rostering practice (repeated changing from day to night duties or 24-hour rest periods \u2013 in which it is impossible to both rest after a long duty and before the next) and pressure from crew rostering to continue when the crew are complaining of fatigue. \u201cBoth of these clear trends \u2026 persist throughout the two month period. Any knowledgeable \u2018auditor\u2019 of these reports would immediately question whether safety management principles are being followed if such practices are condoned or even encouraged by the management of the airline.\u201d Flydubai statement Flydubai said it adhered to \u201call regulations set out by the regulator\u201d and that the company had developed a \u201cno blame\u201d culture so pilots could raise concerns without fear of reprisals. \u201cIn an open, transparent and confidential way staff are encouraged to report all instances that they believe may have safety related consequences. We investigate each of these air safety reports to conclusion to understand if they have any operational irregularities and any safety implications.\u201d Flydubai said any pilot who felt too tired to fly could withdraw from duty \u201cwithout any disciplinary consequence\u201d, and that the number of reports referring to fatigue was small. \u201cIf any of our pilots have any worries or grievances, there are a number of forums and avenues available to them to raise those problems. The welfare of our crew is of the utmost importance and we provide formal and informal support mechanisms. \u201cWe have always been committed to exceeding the regulatory standards by investing in safety, technology, training and procedures,\u201d it said. Flydubai is a state-owned airline flying out of the UAE, whose chairman is His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum. He also runs the Emirates airline and is president of the Department of Civil Aviation. Set up in 2008, it is Dubai\u2019s first budget airline with a fleet of 50 brand new Boeing 737 aircraft, travelling to more than 90 destinations. Until March, it had an unblemished safety record.

Franklin D, the hot favourite, held on to a fast-diminishing lead to win the Betfred Mile by a head and land a major gamble and may now join Big Orange, the Goodwood Cup winner, in pursuit of valuable prizes around the world.   Related: Big Orange lifts stayers\u2019 cup at Glorious Goodwood for second year    Days like these came around with some frequency for Gredley in the 1990s, when User Friendly carried his yellow and black colours to victory in five Group Ones including the Oaks and St Leger, and Environment Friend, a five-length Dante winner in 1991, took the Eclipse two months later. But modern Flat racing is all about strength in numbers and until Big Orange\u2019s emergence as a leading stayer Gredley\u2019s silks had struggled to compete at the highest level. Suddenly he is in a position to pick and choose between Group One targets for Big Orange and can even afford to be lukewarm at best about the possibility of sending him to the Melbourne Cup in November, in which he finished fifth last season. Gredley suggested after Franklin D\u2019s success here on Friday that he may work backwards from the Dubai Gold Cup on World Cup night next March when he plans Big Orange\u2019s schedule. Franklin D, meanwhile, will move into Group races after just lasting home against Master The World, who was in front a stride after the line. \u201cWe\u2019ll pencil in Dubai [for Big Orange] and try to work out something in between,\u201d Gredley said. \u201cThe horse has come back OK so, if he stays sound, we\u2019ll just work out where to go. I\u2019d like to go for a good mile-and-a-half race somewhere or maybe the Irish St Leger. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling out Melbourne but I\u2019m not ruling it in. It\u2019s a long way to go and you don\u2019t know what weight you\u2019re going to get. It\u2019s a fantastic atmosphere down there but we\u2019ll see.\u201d Michael Bell, Big Orange\u2019s trainer, seems more inclined to send the five-year-old back to Flemington Park \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re agreeing to disagree at the moment,\u201d he said \u2013 and may also look abroad for targets for Franklin D, who has improved significantly this season. An emphatic win in a handicap at Newmarket less than a fortnight ago ensured that Franklin D was the clear 4-1 favourite for the 19-runner Betfred Mile on Friday morning and support was relentless for Bell\u2019s runner throughout the day, all the way down to 7-4 at the off. Ryan Moore\u2019s mount was drawn against the rail in stall one, an ideal position, and he was settled in third place as the field started to turn towards home. He still had to sit and wait for an opening with two furlongs to run, however, giving his backers a few nervous moments, and while he grabbed a useful lead as soon as a gap appeared, he was all out to hold off Master The World at the line. William Hill suggested afterwards that Big Orange and Franklin D had combined to cost it \u201ca seven-figure sum\u201d over the last two days and, while bookies gain little from underplaying their setbacks, this was certainly one of the bigger blows landed by the punters this summer. \u201cHe just emptied out a bit in the last 100 yards because he\u2019d gone so hard early but from where he was drawn he had to,\u201d Bell said. \u201cRyan Moore is arguably the world\u2019s best jockey and he gave him a superb ride. We were lucky to have him on board and it\u2019s been one hell of a week. \u201cFranklin D\u2019s got a beautiful pedigree and he\u2019s a beautiful horse who at long last is fulfilling his potential. The Sovereign Stakes at Salisbury could be one option for him but he could also be an international traveller as he loves fast ground and he\u2019s won on a turning track. He\u2019s improving and, when horses start improving, there\u2019s quite a way they can go.\u201d Take Cover took the Group Two King George Stakes for the second time in three years, having finished a close second behind Muthmir 12 months ago, and is now on course to run in the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes at York next month. \u201cHe loves it at York and has won a couple of times there; he just hasn\u2019t had any luck in the Nunthorpe,\u201d David Griffiths, Take Cover\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cFirst time he ran there he hit his head on the stalls and last year he went under them. \u201cWe changed things a bit after last year so now he\u2019s last in and the blindfold comes off at the last minute.

She went anyway and, six days after landing at Islamabad airport, was found dead on the marble-tiled staircase of her cousin\u2019s house in Pandori, a tiny Punjab village filled with families that have one foot in Pakistan and another in Bradford. Kazam is convinced his wife is the latest victim of the epidemic of \u201chonour\u201d killings that has been sweeping Pakistan for years. More than 1,096 cases were reported last year, though the actual number of victims is likely to be far higher. Such crimes are often triggered by women defying centuries-old patriarchal codes and daring to make their own choice about who they marry, or how they live their lives. Shahid not only married a man of her choice, she also divorced her first husband, her cousin Shakeel, a man Kazam says she was pressured to marry in a lavish wedding in Pakistan in 2012. The marriage had been arranged when she was young and it is believed Shahid was expected to apply for a visa for Shakeel so he could join her in the UK. \u201cThe nearer [the wedding] day came, the more she didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d said a friend in Bradford. She went through with the marriage but was so determined not to become pregnant that she asked a British friend in Pakistan to help her get the contraceptive pill \u2013 hard to come by in rural Pakistan. Shahid eventually returned to the UK, where she sought a divorce via the Sharia courts and couriered the legal papers to Shakeel at his Pandori home. Her rejection of the marriage is said to have gravely insulted her family, who refused to recognise the divorce. They reported her missing to the police in November 2014 when she left the UK to live with her new partner, Kazam, in Dubai.     Shahid with her husband, Mukhtar Syed Kazam. Shahid\u2019s \u2018love marriage\u2019 to Kazam was said to have insulted her parents. Photograph: Supplied    Shahid met Kazam, a Pakistani living in Dubai, through mutual friends when he was visiting the UK. They fell in love and got married in September 2014. The family was never likely to approve. Kazam was an outsider; a member of the Syed clan rather than their own Choudhry clan and with no links to their ancestral village near the Mangla dam in Punjab. One of Shahid\u2019s friends, who did her hair and makeup for her wedding, said the bride-to-be was determined to get not just a nikkah (an Islamic marriage certificate), but also a legally binding UK one. \u201cThat\u2019s why they got married at Leeds town hall. She said to me: \u2018You never know when I might need this [marriage certificate]\u2019.I think that\u2019s probably one of the best decisions she ever made.\u201d Raising the potential for yet more disapproval from her family, Shahid converted to Kazam\u2019s Shia school of Islam \u2013 an act tantamount to renouncing faith for hardline Sunnis. According to several friends in Bradford, she was frightened about her trip to Pakistan. \u201cShe was scared that she wouldn\u2019t make it back,\u201d said one. Other Bradford friends said they were not surprised she took the risk of going to Pakistan if she thought her father was seriously ill. He had always doted on Shahid, the eldest of his three daughters. \u201cShe was her daddy\u2019s princess,\u201d said a friend outside the family home. Shahid had attempted to restore her relationship with the family on a return visit to Bradford in September 2015, the Guardian has learned. She was sufficiently worried that she asked a police chaperone to accompany her to a meeting with her own family. It didn\u2019t go well. Even with the officer present, the meeting became heated and one of her relatives received an official police harassment warning, West Yorkshire police said. \u201cShe was very smart, was Samia,\u201d said a friend in Bradford. \u201cThat\u2019s why she took the police officer with her. She thought they\u2019d hurt her or take her passport off her or both.\u201d  Kazam said his wife\u2019s visit to Pakistan this month was \u201cthe longest week of my life\u201d. It became apparent that Shahid\u2019s father, 50-year-old Muhammad Shahid, was not at death\u2019s door, he said. But it was not until the day before she was due to fly home that Kazam said he began to seriously worry about his wife\u2019s safety. The constant stream of instant messages she had been sending suddenly dried up, he said.     Kazam said his wife\u2019s visit to Pakistan this month was \u2018the longest week of my life\u2019 Photograph: Supplied    When he phoned her cousin, a man called Mobeen, Kazam said he was told Shahid \u2013 who he says was a healthy 28-year-old woman \u2013 had died of a heart attack. It was the first in a number of conflicting explanations of her death, including that she had fallen after an asthma attack. The local press carried a story claiming she had killed herself because she was depressed about not having had children, but the family have rejected this.  Aqeel Abbas, the investigating officer on the case, played down the likelihood of foul play, telling the Guardian on Sunday that there had been no signs of external physical injury on Shahid\u2019s body. However, it emerged days later through an autopsy \u2013 and pictures of her body seen by this newspaper \u2013 that Shahid has visible bruising around her neck. A source involved in the investigation said they suspected Shahid was poisoned.  Naz Shah, the local MP in Bradford who has written to the Pakistani authorities to demand an investigation into her constituent\u2019s death, said the development raised fears of a potential cover up. Kazam said he feared Shahid\u2019s family would use their local power to hush up the investigation. The family prospered enough in the decades since they first moved to the UK in 1955 to build large houses back in Pandori. Among the family businesses in Bradford is Oasis Limousines, a luxury car hire company where Shahid\u2019s younger brother Itezaz, known as Itty, rents out Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Ferraris. The Shahids had lived for years in a big, end-of-terrace house by Lister Park in the predominantly Pakistani Manningham area of Bradford, with a heavy metal gate and high hedge shielding the house from the busy road outside. Opposite is a parade of commercial properties, many of which are connected to Shahid\u2019s large extended family. One is Cartwrights solicitors where a cousin, 37-year-old lawyer Naheem Akhtar, is a partner. He was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of making threats to Shah. Akhtar did not respond to requests for comment, but was bailed along with a 32-year-old woman on Wednesday night pending further police inquiries. Shah\u2019s complaints dramatically raised the profile of a case that might otherwise have never gone further than the local Urdu language press in Jhelum district. The interior minister has demanded an in-depth investigation while the chief minister of Punjab has ordered a special committee of top provincial policemen to prepare a report into the affair within three days. The police have been keeping close tabs on her father, who was briefly arrested on Monday night and who has had his passport confiscated. Shakeel has also raised suspicions by fleeing the village and turning off his phone, prompting police to mount a search team. He reappeared on Thursday after being granted pre-arrest bail by the Rawalpindi high court but has not given a statement to police, who are anxiously awaiting the results of forensic tests. Shahid\u2019s friends in Bradford have already made up their minds. One, a friend from the gym which Shahid frequently visited, marched immediately around to Trafalgar House police station to give a statement. \u201cI told them: \u2018My friend has been murdered,\u2019\u201d they said. \u201cI have to get justice for her.\u201d", "title": "'I have to get justice for her': was this British woman a victim of 'honour' killing?", "sentences": ["They reported her missing to the police in November 2014 when she left the UK to live with her new partner, Kazam, in Dubai.", "Photograph: Supplied    Shahid met Kazam, a Pakistani living in Dubai, through mutual friends when he was visiting the UK."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-29T17:40:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/30/greggs-marks-spencer-food-waste-solidarity-fridges-frome-germany-india-spain-uae", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Environment", "Greggs", "Social enterprises", "Communities", "Society", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Food waste"], "article": "A fridge inside a brightly painted ex-public toilet block is helping a Somerset town\u2019s food businesses reduce their waste. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from something a bit weird to being normal,\u201d says Sheila Gore, owner of Frome Wholefoods.  Frome\u2019s community fridge was launched in April 2016 after the town council\u2019s resilience officer, Anna Francis, heard about solidarity fridges in Spain, where residents and restaurants can drop off food otherwise destined for the bin. Students from the Edventure school for community enterprise got it up and running, and one of them \u2013 Esther Deeks \u2013 now coordinates the project. Between 8am and 8pm every day, businesses and individuals can deposit edible food that would otherwise go to waste, and anyone can take it.

Before food is donated the giver must read a set of rules, including no raw meat or fish, but ultimately the responsibility is on the person taking the food. There is a disclaimer on the fridge warning people to make their own judgements on safety. Growing demand The fridge has been rapidly growing in popularity and Francis says they have been overwhelmed by the response. More than 1,000 items were donated to the fridge in June alone and nothing stays in there for long.  The biggest daily donation to the fridge comes from the local branch of Greggs. But participation from other chains has been making slower progress than Francis had hoped, largely because of the difficulty of getting access to the people making decisions at a national level. \u201cYou really need a champion within the business,\u201d she says.   Related: The homeless workers taking on Greggs, Eat and Pret a Manger    However, some bigger retailers are coming on board as word about the fridge spreads. Marks &amp; Spencer donates through neighbourly, a project which matches food initiatives with retailers who have surplus. The fridge team is also in discussion with the Co-op, Iceland and Asda about their local branches donating to the fridge.  The costs of the fridge, around \u00a38 a week for the rent of the space, electricity and other costs, are currently covered by the town council. In a bid to ensure the project\u2019s sustainability, Edventure is starting business sponsorship and a \u201cfriends of the fridge\u201d scheme for individuals.  Wendy Miller-Williams, who coordinates local food bank Fair Frome, describes the fridge as a \u201clifeline\u201d for some, particularly during weekends when referral services are closed. The fridge is complimentary to the food bank, which does not accept fresh produce.  But is the fridge just treating a symptom of a wasteful society which is leaving its poor and most vulnerable in food poverty? \u201cThat\u2019s an argument we\u2019ve come across a lot,\u201d says Johannes Moeller of Edventure. \u201cWe see it as a campaign as much as a service. The fridge makes food waste visible and public.\u201d In 2015, the UK produced 270,000 tonnes of potentially edible food waste. Meanwhile, more than 8 million people are struggling to get enough to eat. International solidarity fridges There are similar projects around the world, including Germany and India. In London, Impact Hub Brixton hopes to open a fridge this summer after raising more than \u00a32,000 in crowdfunding. Spain\u2019s solidarity fridge network, Nevera Solidaria, has gone from strength to strength since it began in April 2015, with nine fridges across Spain and more towns planning to join. The initiative, led by a voluntary group based near Bilbao, is open to everyone in order to reduce stigma and encourage neighbourly solidarity without the need for internet or smartphones.

I think that this is the beauty of the project; everybody can do it and nobody is going to point a finger at you,\u201d explains Ainhoa Crespo Gadea of Nevera Solidaria. Crespo Gadea estimates that as much as 90% of donations come from businesses such as restaurants and food shops.  In the United Arab Emirates, what began as a way to give during Ramadan with a few fridges rapidly scaled up when word spread through a Facebook group. \u201cIt grew to 200 fridges across four Emirates,\u201d explains Sumayyah Sayed, who developed the Sharing Fridge network after watching low income construction and garden workers struggling in heat of over 35 degrees. Donations from businesses have taken off \u2013 from big corporates to small independent restaurants. For example, a cleaning company offered to clean the fridges for free and one chef reportedly cooked 175 biryanis on a regular basis for more than three weeks, on top of his regular work. Sayed is excited about the potential of the sharing fridge movement. \u201cRight now the whole world is in pain and it\u2019s just lovely to see neighbours and communities coming together,\u201d she says.", "title": "Greggs and M&S join movement to donate leftover food to solidarity fridges", "sentences": ["Niaz Zomorodian giving food to local construction workers at her Dubai fridge."], "publicationDate": "2016-07-30T06:16:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/passengers-evacuated-after-plane-crash-lands-at-dubai-airport", "tags": ["Plane crashes", "World news", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Aviation experts are investigating whether faulty landing gear could have caused a plane to crash at Dubai international airport and burst into flames, killing a firefighter tackling the blaze, although all 300 passengers and crew were able to escape. The Emirates Boeing 777 was engulfed by intense fire, and black smoke billowed from its fuselage just after it crash-landed at 12.45pm local time (9.45am BST).  Passengers on flight EK521, which was travelling from Thiruvananthapuram in the southern Indian state of Kerala, and included 226 people from India and 24 from the UK, spoke of their terror as the plane hit the tarmac. Sharon Maryam Sharji told Reuters: \u201cIt was actually really terrifying. As we were landing there was smoke coming out in the cabin. People were screaming and we had a very hard landing.

We thank all teams that dealt with the incident.\u201d The Indian ambassador to the UAE, TP Seetharam, said many passengers were in shock and only one person, a crew member, had been taken to hospital.  Hundreds of thousands of Kerala residents work in the Gulf countries and Indians made up the majority of those on board. But the Indian state is also a popular holiday destination, for which Dubai serves as a connection, and there were 20 nationalities on board including the 24 from the UK, 11 from the United Arab Emirates and six each from the US and Saudi Arabia.  Dubai International airport, the Middle East\u2019s busiest, was closed for more than five hours as a result of the incident, causing many incoming flights to be diverted until it was reopened at around 6.30pm. But Emirates predicted that there would be an eight-hour delay in operations across its network. Video footage showed that the plane appeared to have come down on its belly without the use of its wheels, lending credence to the theory that the landing gear was at fault.  Monitoring site the Aviation Herald said that according to air traffic control recordings no emergency was declared by the aircraft but the control tower reminded the crew to lower the gear as it cleared it to to land.      The gutted fuselage of the Emirates Boeing 777. Photograph: EPA    Some people waiting for relatives said passengers had been informed there was a problem with the landing gear.  Iype Vallikadan, a reporter from Indian newspaper Mathrubhumi News, told the Associated Press that passengers said the pilot spoke to them as the plane neared Dubai, saying there was a problem with the landing gear and that he would make an emergency landing. Passengers said the cabin crew opened all the emergency exits of the plane and that all 300 passengers and crew on board the aircraft were evacuated within minutes of the landing. Aviation expert David Learmount suggested the heat \u2013 it was almost 50C \u2013 could have been a factor. \u201cIf you get a damaged wing and fuel comes out of it, it vaporises in temperatures like that and vapour is highly inflammable,\u201d he said.

The first fatal crash in the plane\u2019s 21-year history only came in July 2013, when an Asiana Airlines jet landed short of the runway in San Francisco. Three of the 307 people on board died, one of whom was hit by an emergency truck after surviving the crash.

Gone was the nibble off the seam exploited so well by Sohail Khan, and though there was cloud cover, particularly later on in the afternoon, there was little swing either for Jimmy Anderson and Chris Woakes in particular to exploit. Reverse swing was there none and the pace of the pitch meantime, while never pacy on the first day, was sluggish as if the groundsman had dressed it with Mogadon overnight. No movement when pitched up then and the ball slunk sullenly through when hammered in short of a length. The Pakistan batsmen painstakingly took advantage, carefully constructing their reply being mindful the game is scheduled for five days and a big first innings lead should be a priority. It would mean their wrist spinner, Yasir Shah, who played such an important defensive role first time around, could have free rein to attack in the second.   Related: Pakistan think-tank\u2019s pre-Test decisions are starting to pay off handsomely    For the most part, though, the England pace bowlers, lacking in penetration as they might have been, were still able to keep things in check. The score ambled along all day, breaking into a trot only when Moeen Ali was given a turn, although his appearance has always been a bugle call this summer when the seamers have largely held sway. By the close Pakistan had reached 257 for three, a strong platform although still 40 runs shy of England and vulnerable to the second new ball which is only 10 overs old. The day was dominated by a second-wicket partnership of 181 between Azhar Ali and Sami Aslam, not broken until half an hour after tea, after Anderson had claimed the wicket of Mohammad Hafeez with the fourth ball of the innings. When the 20-year-old Aslam was run out for 82 he was 18 runs shy of becoming the youngest opening batsman to score a Test century in this country. Azhar, though, was able to complete the 10th hundred of his Test career and got to within one delivery of being able to resume on the third morning. Unfortunately for him he chose the last ball of the day, from Woakes, to try and force off the back foot, the edge flying face high to Alastair Cook at first slip, who took an excellent catch, the more so for the timing of it: easy to have your mind on the dressing room. Azhar made 139 from 293 balls, with 15 fours and a six. Younis Khan, on 21, will resume instead with Misbah-ul-Haq. It was an important wicket for England. If discipline with the bat has all too often not been a strong point of Pakistan cricket, then the thrust of the day was the antithesis. Things could not have begun much worse for them. Spectators had scarcely had time to take their seats when Hafeez slapped Anderson\u2019s long-hop loosener to Gary Ballance at point, rather than scorching the turf on the way to the boundary. Any ideas this was a precursor to a Pakistan procession were disabused over the next four hours. Azhar has occupied the England bowlers before, in the UAE during the winter, when, over almost nine hours, he made 157 in the second Test in Dubai. There is nothing complicated about his method which is well-balanced; he moves into line readily, is neat off his legs and hip, and, until the very last, played with great discretion when not absolutely required to play a shot. A couple of times, against Moeen, as if for a bit of light relief, he opened his shoulders, belting him once over long on and scattering the beer-drinkers in the stand. Azhar offered two chances, neither of them easy but both of which, on a day when there was so little on offer, needed to be taken. In the morning, when 38, he had an uncharacteristic crooked little dart at Anderson outside off stump, the ball flying fast and shoulder high to Joe Root at second slip, who got his hands there but could not cling on. Later, on 69, and with the tea interval imminent, he blasted Moeen straight back at the bowler, the ball travelling at such pace that it burst through his hands; a wonder he had hands left. The England bowlers might have anticipated a day in which they had more success than the first-over strangle. The ball did beat the bat on occasion, perhaps more than the scorecard suggests, but it was drudgery.   Related: England v Pakistan: third Test, day two \u2013 as it happened    Anderson was not at his best and his general disgruntlement was only enhanced when he received a brace of official warnings from Bruce Oxenford for encroaching on to the line of the stumps in his follow-through; another and that is him done for the rest of the innings. His opening partner, Stuart Broad, was off target and appears to be relying heavily on pushing the ball into the right-hander, so that he needs to be careful he does not lose his away swing as a result, as happened to Anderson for a period of time a few years back. Nor was there joy for the other two seamers. Woakes on his home ground was lively enough, and sometimes skiddiness can be more effective on slow pitches, but he could not find the movement he craves until the second new ball and Azhar\u2019s indiscretion. Steve Finn ran in hard and generated some good pace, although his best length is a heavy one and any attempt to rectify that can lead to a floatiness. England\u2019s only other wicket was down to Pakistan enthusiasm and the athleticism in the field of James Vince. Azhar and Aslam had been proactive in looking for quick singles during their stand and they appeared to have a good understanding. Now though Azhar pushed one short towards cover point and set off head down. His partner responded, as juniors tend to do, but Vince swooped in, collected with one hand and had time to take aim and detonate the leg stump from the ground.", "title": "Azhar Ali puts Pakistan in control with superb century as England struggle", "sentences": ["Azhar has occupied the England bowlers before, in the UAE during the winter, when, over almost nine hours, he made 157 in the second Test in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-08-04T18:06:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/06/south-africa-coast-surf-intstructor-course-volunteering", "tags": ["Surfing holidays", "South Africa holidays", "Cape Town holidays", "Africa holidays", "Travel", "Learning holidays", "Group trips", "Gap year travel", "Water sports holidays", "Adventure travel"], "article": "It\u2019s a bright afternoon on Cape Town\u2019s Muizenberg beach and I\u2019m racing down the sand in a wetsuit, stopping to lunge or star-jump as coach Nikita shouts orders.

More people die taking selfies (falling off cliffs, being hit by trains), or from coconuts falling on their heads, than in shark attacks, he tells me. The buzz from catching a wave is amazing \u2013 and I soon appreciate the others\u2019 addiction to surfing. Staying a week or longer in each of the seven destinations means there\u2019s time to get out and do touristy things. We visit the penguins at Boulders Beach and hang out at a local market one evening. Climbing Table Mountain and hitting the nightlife are on the agenda too, as well as surfing Cape Town\u2019s more challenging spots, from Long Beach to Kommetjie.     Jennifer Snell with kids from the Waves For Change foundation. Photograph: no credit    But a big part of the programme is working on community projects in each location. In Cape Town, it\u2019s Waves for Change, a foundation started by an former TTR employee, Tim Conibear, which runs HIV awareness and youth leadership programmes in the townships, using surfing as a platform for education. We join the kids for a warm-up on the beach before they jump into the ocean to practise their surf skills with the help of the TTR group. Part of the deal is that the children must go to school, and attend after-school lessons at the project centre. \u201cThese kids come from the streets, from gangs and broken homes,\u201d says Tim. \u201cWe help them gain confidence, find a sense of belonging and learn important life skills \u2013 and they get a hot meal, too. There needs to be something cool to get them interested \u2013 and surfing has that cool factor.\u201d Our group will be back next day to help paint the shipping containers used as classrooms.     The beach at Plettenberg Bay. Photograph: Peter Unger/Getty Images    Sadly, I don\u2019t have the luxury of 10 weeks at my disposal, so the next morning I set off ahead of the group with Chris to check out a few of the other places on the itinerary. It\u2019s a beautiful drive to Plettenberg Bay, the next stop, and en route the group will get the chance to test the world\u2019s highest bridge bungee jump, at Tsitsikamma. \u201cPlett\u201d has a long arc of unspoiled sandy beach \u2013 and the accommodation, Albergo for Backpackers, is a great spot with an open braai in the evenings. Further along the coast, Jeffreys Bay is a surfing mecca \u2013 a stop on the world tour and backdrop to Bruce Brown\u2019s seminal 1966 surf movie The Endless Summer. (It was also the site where surf champ Mick Canning once got attacked by a shark but we won\u2019t dwell on that.) Island Vibe, the hostel used by TTR, sits on a bluff overlooking Kitchen Windows, one of J-Bay\u2019s most famous waves, and I can imagine the fun the group will have here.     Plettenberg Bayalbergo for backpackers    Etienne Venter, coach of the South African surf team, will be working them hard too. Swim training in local pools, video analysis of surfing techniques, lessons in surf etiquette and lifesaving skills are all taught along the way. \u201cThis is a turning point in their journey,\u201d says Etienne. \u201cThey\u2019ll really start to put into practice and fine tune what they\u2019ve learnt so far.\u201d Time will also be spent in township schools here, helping with maintenance and teaching, as well as with the Supertubes Surfing Foundation, a community-run conservation project with a brilliant recycling initiative. All too soon, it\u2019s time for me to fly home from Port Elizabeth, sad not to have time to visit the more remote destinations on the itinerary, but keenly aware how just being out in the ocean every day for 10 weeks must have a profound affect on a person. As they venture further around the coast the landscape will change again, the dramatic mountainous scenery of the Western Cape transforming into the more tropical, lush east coast.     Island Vibe hostel, Jeffrey\u2019s Bay    Chintsa on the \u201cWild Coast\u201d north of East London brings warmer waters (as the Indian Ocean heats up, wetsuits are cast aside), empty waves and the chance to visit game parks. Then they\u2019ll head to Coffee Bay in the Transkei, another Africa altogether, with traditional settlements and rolling hills, where accommodation is at the Coffee Shack camp, run by Dave Malherbe, one of the country\u2019s most successful competitive surfers. Durban, South Africa\u2019s \u201csurf city\u201d and Ballito, 45 minutes to the north, where the lifesaving and instructor exams take place, round off the trip. Weeks later, back in the UK, I email Jennifer to find out how the rest of the journey went. She qualified and is now teaching with Ticket to Ride\u2019s Newquay office over the summer, hoping to eventually work for a surfing or ocean conservation charity. Catching waves alongside dolphins, the beauty of the Transkei, visiting traditional Xosha families, surfing legendary Jordy Smith\u2019s home break, making lifelong friends \u2026 she\u2019s hard-pushed to name the highlight of the trip. \u201cI simply had the time of my life,\u201d she concludes. How to do it The trip was provided by Ticket to Ride. The next 10-week South Africa surf instructor course starts on 9 September and costs from \u00a35,445pp. Another course runs from 19 January 2017 at \u00a34,995pp. The price includes airport transfers, accommodation, local travel, surf coaching, ISA level 1 surf instructor and surf lifeguard qualifications, and visits to tourist attractions (excludes flights).

Take an early, horrific, double lesson with my year 11 class: I\u2019d spent hours planning and preparing little cards for a matching exercise, but within 10 minutes the cards were stamped, scrunched and thrown all over the floor.  Tom was looking at his phone. David and Oliver sent my coffee flying while practising rugby tackles. When Ahmed came in late, he swore. But his voice was drowned out by Tobias and Henry chanting \u201cAllahu Akbar!\u201d. I told them that their behaviour was unacceptable and forced them to apologise, which they did, albeit half-heartedly. I held my nerve and dealt with each new disruption in turn, calmly reasserting the rules. I was starting to win the battle, until Oliver sneered: \u201cI don\u2019t have to do what you say. My father pays your wages. And anyway, I don\u2019t take orders from a woman.\u201d Just then, my eyes meet those of another \u2013 impeccably behaved \u2013 student; his were pleading, mine were apologising. At the next staff meeting \u2013 the air rank with eyerolls and passive aggression \u2013 a young maths teacher asked for advice on a challenging class, as he was having trouble controlling them. Suddenly the carpet became an object of fascination for everyone else in the room.

But he didn\u2019t see me; his eyes were fixed on the table. Requests for help continued to go unanswered. By the time my first parents\u2019 evening came around, my questions about how to manage the meetings had all been waved away and I was forced to jump straight in.

We discussed our experiences, bleary-eyed, as we were urged to breathe, drink warm milk or try some yoga when we were feeling overwhelmed.  But the reality quickly emerged: we hadn\u2019t even finished the course and some of us were already running for the hills. Hannah was setting up her own business as a personal trainer; Scott was looking into tutoring in Dubai. A variety of other exit strategies were discussed over the day. I wrapped up the year with a placement at a state comprehensive. On the last day, my group of eager, impeccably behaved year 7s crowded around to give me a card they had all signed.

About the size of a plate, they whipped through the track of the second annual National Drone Racing Championship, piloted by racers in goggles standing a few yards away. Friday was a practice day at the drone race, a sport that\u2019s still in its infancy. But this weekend\u2019s event is its big moment. For the first time in drone racing\u2019s short existence, the competition will be broadcast on ESPN. \u201cWe\u2019re all really excited to have something to crown the industry and show what this is all about,\u201d said competitor Zoe Stumbaugh, who began drone racing about two years ago. But the cameras also add a degree of pressure. \u201cIs it going to be a huge sport that explodes or is something else going to happen to it?\u201d Ken Loo, Stumbaugh\u2019s team-mate on team AirVuz, said. \u201cThis is the first televised event where a big network is picking up the coverage, so it\u2019s gotta go well.\u201d The national championships, hosted by the Drone Sports Association and sponsored by GoPro, will be broadcast live on ESPN3, the network\u2019s online channel, and as a package on one of its cable channels. The event can also be watched live for free. Stumbaugh, Loo and about 100 mostly male fellow competitors, known as pilots, arrived with multiple X-shaped quadcopters dangling off their backpacks or carrying winged, plane-like drones for the event. Participants of all ages came from around the country toting their gear. Sorell Miller, 12, and his father, Conrad, 37, came from Boise, Idaho, for the event. The pair recently joined the same team as Stumbaugh and Loo and have a bit of a rivalry. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to beat him,\u201d Miller said of his father. He beat his father in his first race in Oregon last week, the pair said. Pilots can participate in four events \u2013 an individual race, team relay, freestyle and flying wing. The actual competition takes place on Saturday and Sunday, while Friday was spent checking equipment and setting up video feeds. Practice commenced late on Friday afternoon. Racers stood under a tent in the center of the track wearing first-person view (FPV) goggles that enabled them to see out of the cameras on their drones. Controllers in hand, they sped their small drones through large hooped obstacles. The drones raced for about three minutes \u2013 as long as their batteries allowed \u2013 with a 60mph speed limit. Crashes are infrequent but painful \u2013 Loo said \u201cit\u2019s like his baby going down\u201d. Other pilots followed along through their own goggles or on sometimes-shaky video screens.     Racers wear first-person goggles to let them see out of their drones\u2019 camera. Photograph: Nicole Puglise for the Guardian    Drone Sports Association chairman Scot Refsland walked through the course with pilots beforehand, explaining its U-shape and vertical as well as horizontal obstacles. Weather will be another obstacle \u2013 as wind whipped through the track, knocking down a hoop. Rain is expected for the weekend, but an event official said they built time into the schedule to wait for bad weather to pass. Refsland emphasized that the race wants to be \u201cspectator friendly\u201d \u2013 a challenge for the small, fast-moving sport \u2013 and that they\u2019ll bring the action as close to the live audience as possible. To the side of the track was a VIP tent and some bleachers to watch.  The first national drone racing championship at the California state fair last year had only a handful of spectators, according to Quartz. But Stumbaugh said she thought a crowd would show up for the races this weekend, since the event was promoted more. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazingly huge event with the best pilots in the US,\u201d she said. As a mark of the sport\u2019s increasing popularity, the Drone Sports Association is one of multiple leagues that have formed around the sport. The Drone Racing League, by contrast, doesn\u2019t aim to have spectators, but rather compiles a video package of its races. Last year\u2019s competition in Dubai was particularly high stakes, with a prize of $1m. This event winner will go on to compete in an international tournament staged by the Drone Sports Association in Hawaii later this year. Loo and Stumbaugh are two of the many racers with a moderate social media presence, as YouTube and Instagram have become even more important to its livelihood. Loo said he never used social media until he built his first drone in 2014. He said he uses the platforms for promoting sponsors and getting the word out about drone racing.  \u201cI want this to become an everybody hobby,\u201d Stumbaugh said. She praised the sport\u2019s accessibility for all types. She built her first drone after being bedridden due to a medical condition and said flying a drone was \u201cthe most enabling thing\u201d she had ever done. \u201cIt was an instant turnaround from being depressed, stuck in bed, to I can fly free,\u201d Stumbaugh said. \u201cThis is the only sport where its a really even playing field.

The large and enthusiastic crowd of mostly once-a-year racegoers produced by far the biggest cheer of the day for the 33-year-old, who said later that she nearly fell off in her post-race celebrations, punching the air and blowing kisses to all. \u201cOh my God, it was amazing,\u201d said Turner, who was persuaded to stay and talk to reporters in the immediate aftermath when her instinct was to respond immediately to a call from the stewards\u2019 room. The officials, after all, merely wished to give her a four-day ban for overuse of the whip, to be served a fortnight from now, when she has no intention of race-riding. Despite this success and the renewed connection between Turner and her followers, this really is not the start of a lasting return to action for the most successful female jockey Britain has produced. There was a delicious moment when that question was put to her, for the umpteenth time in the week, by the broadcaster Matt Chapman in an interview that was going out live over the racecourse loudspeakers. \u201cI can\u2019t because I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Turner replied and kept her straight face while some of the media folk around her turned puce with excitement. Chapman, however, has been to the circus before. \u201cLast time you used that line, it was going to be twins,\u201d he said. Speaking more plainly, Turner said: \u201cNot every day is like this. This has always been my favourite day of the year and if it was like this every day, then of course I\u2019d be riding. But the day-to-day slog of the whole thing, it\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve kind of lost the spark for those days and to be at my best you need that. So I\u2019m just taking days like this instead.\u201d There could be another brief comeback for the Leger Legends race at Doncaster next month. Early Morning\u2019s backstory rather added to the fairytale aspect of this result, this powerful-looking grey having had what seemed to be a career-ending injury two years ago when he fractured his cannon bone.   Related: Hayley Turner confirms retirement at end of turf season at Doncaster    \u201cHayley gave it a beautiful ride,\u201d said the winning trainer, Harry Dunlop, who laughingly admitted to some qualms when his horse was allotted Turner in the random draw for mounts. \u201cI was a bit unnerved because she obviously hadn\u2019t ridden that much but she\u2019s ridden me a big winner before, a long time ago. I think it\u2019s incredible what she\u2019s done.\u201d But there was no repeat of last year\u2019s wildly popular success for the Girls team, who finished third this time after a couple of tactically disappointing rides from Josephine Gordon and Emma\u2011Jayne Wilson. They were not alone in that regard, since the circumstances of this event, with jockeys riding unfamiliar horses at a circuit some do not know well, lead to things going wrong for a fair portion of runners. Kenichi Ikezoe did not fare well, looking weak in the finish to the stayers\u2019 race in which his favourite was outbattled by a 25-1 shot. Later, he went off far too quickly in the Classic. Frankie Dettori, who came here seeking the two winners that would take him to a total of 3,000 in Britain, extended his oddly poor Shergar Cup record with five unplaced efforts and set off far too fast in the closing sprint. Dettori is now expected to take a short break, returning on Friday evening at Newmarket. The 49-year-old Frenchman Thierry Jarnet took the Silver Saddle, his two wins here being his first in Britain for 21 years. Also impressive was Gavin Lerena, from South Africa, whose acute judgment of pace brought him victories at odds of 25-1 and 10-1, helping to securie the cup for the rest of the world team. Lerana hopes to find a couple of rides at Newmarket later this week before flying home. With a crowd of almost 30,000, the Shergar Cup is a continued success, despite the resentment it attracts from some diehard punters. Ascot\u2019s chief executive, Guy Henderson, said much of the credit was due to an enthusiastic sponsor in Dubai Duty Free but added that the competition format is clearly working for those who come through the gates; after Royal Ascot, the Shergar Cup produces Ascot\u2019s highest percentage of rebookings each year. The day was not a great success for Silvestre De Sousa, even though he captained the winning Rest Of The World team. The Brazilian is working hard in an attempt to retain his title as champion jockey but is going through a quiet spell and couldn\u2019t get a winner here. Worse, he was unseated after the line in the first race and lay winded on the ground for some minutes. He was able to take his rides through the rest of the card but said the fall had left him with a sore shoulder.", "title": "Hayley Turner\u2019s Shergar Cup triumph boosts Ascot event\u2019s success story", "sentences": ["Ascot\u2019s chief executive, Guy Henderson, said much of the credit was due to an enthusiastic sponsor in Dubai Duty Free but added that the competition format is clearly working for those who come through the gates; after Royal Ascot, the Shergar Cup produces Ascot\u2019s highest percentage of rebookings each year."], "publicationDate": "2016-08-06T17:09:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "US news", "US politics"], "article": "Fresh flowers appeared this week at the simple marble headstone of Humayun Khan, an American Muslim killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq in 2004.

Photograph: KHIZR KHAN    This sombre, serene oasis overlooking the Potomac river might also prove the graveyard of Donald Trump\u2019s ambitions for the US presidency. The tributes to Khan, an army captain, reflect how in the eyes of many Americans, this was the week when the bombastic tycoon finally went too far. He has got away with insulting women, Mexicans, Muslims and fellow Republicans and once bragged: \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\u201d But when he took on the grieving parents of a war hero, he crossed a line.  It began at last month\u2019s Democratic convention when Khan\u2019s father, Khizr, excoriated Trump and asked, \u201cHave you even read the United States constitution?\u201d while brandishing a copy above his head. Trump, as is his wont, blasted back. He insisted that Khizr had \u201cno right\u201d to criticise him, claimed that he too has made \u201ca lot of sacrifices\u201d, and wondered aloud why Ghazala Khan had stood silent beside her husband. \u201cShe had nothing to say,\u201d Trump told ABC News. \u201cMaybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say.\u201d But the political ploys that have served him so well appeared to backfire this time. The Khans toured TV studios, explaining that grief had overwhelmed Ghazala when she saw a photo of her son \u2013 and then the couple calmly upbraided the Republican nominee\u2019s character. Barack Obama dismissed him as \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency. Numerous military veterans and members of his own party turned against him. Some polls showed his rival, Hillary Clinton, with a double digit lead. There was a sense of the wheels coming off: a Trump train wreck. His nemesis was a man he never met and never will. Today there is only the headstone, inscribed with an Islamic star and crescent, standing among dozens of Christian crosses of other veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan in the cemetery\u2019s section 60, the plot called \u201cthe saddest acre in America\u201d. Who was Humayun Khan?   Related: Military veterans demand Republicans unendorse Trump and his 'ignorance'    His parents met at Punjab University in Lahore, Pakistan, then moved to Dubai, and he was born in the United Arab Emirates on 9 September 1976. When Khan was two, they followed so many other hopeful immigrants to the US \u2013 \u201cif it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America,\u201d Khan said in July. The family started in Houston, Texas, then settled in Silver Spring, Maryland, where Khizr worked at a mortgage company and law firms. \u201cIt was literally the same story with the rest of the immigrants who came empty-handed,\u201d Khizr, a 66-year-old lawyer, told MSNBC. \u201cWe rented a $200 apartment, one bedroom apartment, with the family and started the life. But we were looking forward to the goodness of the country and the values.\u201d The Khans have fond memories of their naturalisation ceremony, in which they swore an oath of allegiance and pledged to uphold the US constitution. \u201cI just have such a soft place in my heart whenever I see United States flag,\u201d Khizr added, choking with emotion. \u201cIt means so much to me. And I can tell you the reason ... whenever I see these ceremonies and the expressions of the people\u2019s faces, it reminds me when we first came to this country with hope and with belief that we will make it and it will get better. \u201cAnd with that hope in the ceremony, I was just beside myself [with] what is about to happen: I\u2019m going to get the rights that no other country grants to its immigrants except this good nation.\u201d The couple retains the idealism about their country that jaded local residents often lack. In a 2005 interview with the Washington Post, Khizr recalled that he used to take his three sons to the Thomas Jefferson memorial and make them read the inspiring words inscribed there. Humayun, the middle child, loved reading about Jefferson, and later quoted him in an essay that helped secure his place at the University of Virginia. Before that, he graduated from the John F Kennedy High School in Silver Spring. \u201cHumayun was always dependable,\u201d Ghazala wrote in an op-ed this week. \u201cIf I was vacuuming the house and he was home, he would take the vacuum from my hand and clean the house. He volunteered to teach disabled children in the hospital how to swim. He said, \u2018I love when they have a little bit of progress and their faces, they light up. At least they are that much happy.\u2019 He wanted to be a lawyer, like his father, to help people.\u201d At university, he majored in psychology and planned to attend law school. But he also joined the Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (ROTC) and, after graduating in 2000, told Khizr that enlisting in the army felt like the natural next step.     The gravesite of Humayun Khan in Arlington, Virginia. Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images    Despite their reservations, the couple were gratified by the sight of their son in an American uniform. \u201cAfter we pinned him his lieutenant bars after commissioning,\u201d Khizr said, \u201cwe got the first salute from him and it meant the world to us, looking at our young son in the uniform of this beautiful, beautiful place where we have made home. And the pride in his eyes and happiness and joy on his face was just amazing.\u201d   But in 2003, George W Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq over what proved to be nonexistent weapons of mass destruction. Many tens of thousands of people have since been killed, including more than 4,000 US soldiers. The reverberations, including the rise of the so-called Islamic State extremist group, still haunt the US and the world. Khan last spoke to his parents on Mother\u2019s Day, 2004. Ghazala told her son, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be a hero. I want you to return back to me safely,\u201d according to the New York Times. Khan replied: \u201cOf course I will. But mother, you should know I have responsibility for these soldiers, and I cannot leave them unprotected.\u201d Khan helped Iraqi civilians find work for $5 an hour patrolling the streets of Baquba base, north-east of Baghdad. He belonged to a logistics unit, the 201st Forward Support Battalion, which guarded the gates of a base known as Camp Warhorse. The mood was tense. Several innocent Iraqis, driving to work at the base, had just been killed or injured at the gates for failing to heed warning signs and guards. On the morning of 8 June 2004, the gate guards alerted Humayun to an orange-and-white taxi moving slowly moving towards the base. He yelled for everyone to hit the ground, then walked 10 steps towards the taxi with his arm outstretched, gesturing to halt. The driver detonated his explosives before the car could ram the gates or nearby mess hall, where more than a hundred soldiers were at breakfast. Khan and two Iraqis were killed. As of last December, he was one of 14 American Muslims who have died serving the US since the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001. Khan, 27, was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star and buried at Arlington, in a service under a hot midday sun that included the Nimaz-e-Janaza, an Islamic funeral prayer. His girlfriend, Irene Auer, from Germany, told the Post that day: \u201cWhenever I was upset, he always found the right words. He always calmed me down. He was perfect. He was the most wonderful person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d  Decorum, politics and respect for the dead that transcends culture have long put killed soldiers and their families beyond reproach. Clinton, who has been bitterly condemned by a woman whose son died in the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, has been painstakingly sympathetic. Trump charged forward like a bull in a china shop, crashing and smashing his way through every taboo. On Tuesday, after days of criticising the Khans, he boasted how a veteran had given him a Purple Heart, which he had \u201calways wanted\u201d.  Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who was the Republicans\u2019 2008 nominee, was unsparing. \u201cWhile our party has bestowed upon him the nomination,\u201d he said this week, \u201cit is not accompanied by unfettered licence to defame those who are the best among us.\u201d A group of veterans gathered on Capitol Hill to petition McCain and other Republican leaders to withdraw their endorsements of Trump. They included Mickiela Montoya, who served in Iraq in 2004. \u201cDonald Trump has attacked every single one of my identities,\u201d she said, describing herself as a woman, veteran, Latina and mother. \u201cTrump is trying to change the definition of what it means to be an American.\u201d The last non-politician to win the presidency was Gen Dwight Eisenhower, who took the unconditional surrender of the Nazis. Trump is a former reality TV show host who received five deferments from the Vietnam war draft: four for university and one for health (\u201cheel spurs\u201d). Trump also once said that avoiding venereal diseases had been his \u201cpersonal Vietnam\u201d.   trump clinton polls   Galen, 69, a veteran of the national guard who went on to be press secretary to vice-president Dan Quayle, will not be voting for his party\u2019s nominee. \u201cWe treat fallen servicemen with a great deal of respect and their families with a great deal of compassion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political and social faux pas to do anything to disagree with that. What Trump did was violate this compassion rule.\u201d \u201cTrump had such tin ear,\u201d Galen added. \u201cAll he had to do was say, \u2018I\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your son,\u2019 and that would have ended it. Instead it\u2019s gone on for a week.\u201d Indeed, history might judge Khizr Khan\u2019s seven-minute speech in Philadelphia as the turning point in this year\u2019s presidential election: the moment that Trump was finally unmasked. \u201cHave you ever been to Arlington cemetery?\u201d Khizr asked, a question that remains unanswered.  \u201cGo look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities.

Dharamsala, where the iced crags of the Himalayas loom behind the stadium like hired muscle. The Basin Reserve, built inside a massive traffic roundabout in Wellington. Southampton\u2019s Rose Bowl, where half the grandstand is a Hilton hotel. Concrete slabs in Samoan villages on Savai\u2019i, where the bat is a triangular club and the ball made from strands of twisted rubber. The Pallekele ground outside Kandy surrounded by wave-form hills, mist and showers winding between, a gentle environment to regard whenever the environment itself has stopped play.   Of all these, the most striking might be the most recent. From Kandy you wind down west from the hills, narrow roads choked with buses and people and trishaws, then you kiss the outskirts of Colombo before bending south and hitting the large modern freeway that speeds you to Galle. This is Tony Greig\u2019s freeway \u2013 apparently in 2011 the man with the hat was given presidential dispensation to use the as-yet unopened road, while everyone else took the winding coast route.   The thought of Greig driving a vehicle reflexively brings one line to mind: \u201cI don\u2019t hold a grudge, Bill. For me, a grudge is nothing more than a place to pork your cor.\u201d Echoes from the past. But then that whole tour looks spectral now, the era gone: a president named Rajapaksa, Greig on television, Peter Roebuck on radio, the series on ABC, Michael Hussey batting, Australia winning in Asia, Nathan Lyon having hair.  Down the end of Greigy\u2019s motorway lies Galle. The day we arrive we\u2019re running late for the Australian coach\u2019s press conference, worrying as the GPS shows we still have to cross the city. That takes about seven minutes. Turns out it\u2019s not a big place. It sprawls along the beachfront, sand and waves and lean-to shacks for shelter. Built over the memory of the 2004 tsunami, the whole town hums with fragility.    Related: Sri Lanka wrap up series against Australia with victory in second Test     The ground is right in the middle. A couple of low stands, the rest made up of grass banks. These are jammed full by the last session each day, the locals singing in clumps, the visitors doing their best to survive numerous cans of 9% beer. If you\u2019re broke or passing by you can still watch play through the chainlink fence. Or there\u2019s another option, the thing that makes the ground special.   From the stand, down to the south-west corner, you can see the ocean, heavy surf bashing onto the shore across the road. To the left, the bulk of Galle Fort begins. Its current stone iteration was started by the Dutch when they overran the Portuguese in 1640, and the massive walls indicate how little they wanted to give it back.   This mottled mass of granite and coral, metres deep and metres high, faces the entire south side of the ground. Behind and over it, the famous clock tower bristles with scaffolding, as though attended by an arachnid geometrist. Flags starched sideways by the stiff sea breeze. All along the ramparts, the space for soldiers and cannons is now covered in grass, and consequently in people, lying back, eating, reading, flying Sri Lankan kites. On match days, mostly watching the cricket, from the perfect vantage point.  The wall didn\u2019t get much action in the Test just gone \u2013 barely lunch on day three before Australia were boxed up and packed away. After such a loss people love blanket statements, issued with all the certainty of hindsight.  The 1999 Test matched the one just completed, in that Sri Lanka lost a wicket first ball before recovering to 296. The Australians did a better job, making 228, but rain killed the contest. Rangana Herath \u2013 the destroyer of 2016 \u2013 made his debut. In 2011, Australia made competent scores of 273 and 210, which became match-winning given Lyon and Shane Watson took down Sri Lanka\u2019s first innings for 105.  The 2004 Test was a classic comeback, down by 161 on the first innings, before hundreds from Damien Martyn, Matthew Hayden and current coach Darren Lehmann secured a 352 lead. The visiting spinners prevented the chase, Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill taking nine in the innings. Across the match, Muttiah Muralitharan took six cheaply, then five expensively, Warne took five expensively then five for a bargain. In a beautiful display of spinner synchrony, Murali had Warne stumped for a duck and MacGill out first ball, then in his two innings was caught second ball off Warne and stumped first ball against MacGill.

Photograph: Ishara S.kodikara/AFP/Getty Images     Those results sat in the context, before this series, of 13 Tests played in Sri Lanka over the course of 33 years for one defeat \u2013 and that in the nine-man match in 1999 after Steve Waugh and Jason Gillespie were taken to hospital. It\u2019s easy to say that Australia can\u2019t play in these conditions. Except they can, and recently enough they did. If ever this series looked a foregone conclusion, it was in the opposite direction, given Sri Lanka\u2019s recent frailty and Australia\u2019s record. Then along comes this team, one spooked by demolitions against India and Pakistan, and whose cancelled tour of Bangladesh last October increasingly looks like a dodged bullet. In less than six days\u2019 worth of cricket, what had been inevitable was firmly \u2026 evited?  As far as the batting goes, there is little more to be said. As in Dubai, as in Sharjah, as in Kandy, a succession of batsmen were spooked by balls that spun and were out to balls that didn\u2019t. The defining image of this series will be Usman Khawaja, bat raised in a leave, watching the ball into his stumps like a kid watching a lost balloon ascend to the troposphere.   Steve Smith was so bereft of positives that a few dicey Adam Voges reverse sweeps straight to point and a couple of Mitchell Marsh clouts over the infield were deemed by the captain to be signs of evolution, courage and intent. Perhaps from the change room; from the commentary box they looked like throes of desperation, lost Alaskan hikers thrashing their waterproof jackets at a distant Cessna.   Bowling is generally more difficult to assess. No scorecard reflects the mass of variables behind each performance. It\u2019s not so hard to find the difference though, when Australia\u2019s specialist spinners took six wickets and Sri Lanka\u2019s took 18. The hosts took theirs at 13.2 runs a pop, the guests at 48.5. If you\u2019re a left-arm orthodox specialist, it\u2019s probably not a good sign when you\u2019re dragged for a part-timer delivering the same variety. That\u2019s the indignity Jon Holland suffered, replaced by Adam Voges at one stage in his second innings.   It was part of Holland\u2019s general suffering in his first Test. With the bat, he was twice nought not out. With the ball he fluked one wicket per innings, the first lbw from a missed full toss, the second from a reverse sweep edged into the stumps. The words \u201cclassic dismissal\u201d were not heard on commentary.   Including part-timers, Australian Test debutants have bowled in 141 innings. In his second, Holland was thrashed for the third-worst economy rate among them, going at 6.9 an over. One man ahead of him is of course Bryce McGain, attacked so ruthlessly by South Africa to the tune of 8.27 an over. The other is Voges, who bowled two overs on debut for 15 runs. Holland\u2019s other innings ranked 16th, at 4.26 an over, just ahead of the second innings of Steve O\u2019Keefe\u2019s debut.    Related: Sri Lanka\u2019s unheralded side manages what its most distinguished could not | Geoff Lemon     Mind you, Holland is part of a trend of Australian spinners having a torrid welcome that often doubles as their farewell. McGain\u2019s tale. Xavier Doherty\u2019s 0-107. Beau Casson\u2019s 0-43 and 3-86. O\u2019Keefe with 2-107 and 2-112 in the Emirates. Brad Hogg\u2019s 1-69 in Delhi. Ashton Agar, 0-24 and 2-82. Cameron White, 0-39 and 1-49. Michael Beer, 1-112.   MacGill\u2019s 2-112 in the first innings against South Africa, then 3-22 against pinch-hitters chasing declaration runs. Warne\u2019s famous 1-150. Nathan Hauritz, barely used and flattered by 3-16 against the tail in Mumbai, but returning 2-87 in the second innings even as the wicket fell apart and Michael Clarke entered the frame with 6-9. Even Jason Krejza, with his 12-wicket debut match in India, was tapped for 358 runs in getting them.   The exception is Lyon, peculiarly at this same Galle ground, where he took 5-34. That was also the last Test that Australian won in Asia. Lyon\u2019s second debut innings was on trend, 1-73 at 3.68 per over. That\u2019s the trend he carried over into this match.  Only Mitchell Starc in any way grasped how to play at Galle. His first innings figures of 5-44 disprove the aphorism I would like to employ, because here I am writing home about it. But not all figures starting with \u201cfive for\u201d reflect a blistering spell. Actually on the first morning Starc dished up two flaky breakfast pastries, but Sri Lanka\u2019s woeful openers have mustered 30 runs in the series across eight single-figure innings. Presented with a Danish, they responded with something rotten. He finished the innings along with the stumps of two tailenders, not the hardest task given his repertoire. Only the middle wicket of Kusal Mendis required a seriously good ball to a seriously good batsman.   But Starc\u2019s efforts in the second innings were a purer display of skill: pace, movement, aggression, outside edges, his trademark splattering of stumps late in the day coming as the icing on a more substantial cake. His 5-44 had become the second-best return by a seamer at Galle, but there were 22 better performances by spinners. Second time his 6-50 leapt to eighth overall. Only a few efforts by Herath, Murali, Ravichandran Ashwin and Yasir Shah lie ahead of him. He\u2019d also returned the second-best figures in an innings by an Australian against Sri Lanka, with 11-94 the best in a match.   Which goes to show that breaking records doesn\u2019t mean much if players work alone. When a game starts sliding away from a team, it can landslide. Plenty of touring sides have endured these in Australia, but even Sri Lanka\u2019s thrashing in Melbourne on their last trip didn\u2019t have a day quite as abject as Australia\u2019s second here: eight wickets before lunch, two sessions of being merrily carted, then back to lose three more wickets in six overs by stumps.  There is one Test left to find some answers, develop different ways to play, show up the fatalism that says all this was doomed to transpire. The Sinhalese Sports Club pitch in Colombo has often been a batting paradise, but local sources say it can be prepared to take spin. No doubt it will. A few early tremors and things could get ugly.

He was the Voice \u2013 when he sings, he\u2019s in your spirit. I can honour that, but I can\u2019t replicate it. His western audiences didn\u2019t even understand the languages he performed in, but their responses? Mindblowing.\u201d In PR terms, it seems a car-crash admission; Khan is on course to sell out the O2 arena this weekend for the second time, with a three-hour performance of devotional music (qawaalis), poems (ghazals) and film songs. He headlined the Nobel peace prize concert two years ago, and breezily credits himself with bringing the album format back to life in his native Pakistan. With his numerous appearances on chatshows, judging panels and major film soundtracks, the 42-year-old has built a reputation as the subcontinent\u2019s most popular singer. Faisalabad-born Khan comes from a family steeped in six centuries of qawaali tradition, but is best known to contemporary audiences as nephew to Nusrat. The latter was a transcendental force who would perform sitting cross-legged on a rug and routinely bring audiences, literally, to their knees. \u201cIn our century there have been only one or two voices like [his]\u201d, wrote the critic Geoff Dyer in 1994, \u201cvoices that rend the soul even as they soothe it.\u201d     Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in 1989. Photograph: Tim Hall/Redferns    Twenty years ago this summer, Rahat was performing with his uncle on what would be their last US tour together; Madonna and Michael Stipe turned up to their LA shows, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins to New York. Massive Attack remixed one of Khan senior\u2019s greatest qawaalis (Dama Dam Mast Qalander) into a dubby club edit; producer Rick Rubin signed up \u201cthe master\u201d to his label, American Recordings. Less than a year later, at 48 years old and reportedly weighing more than 21 stone (300lb), Nusrat was dead. Collaborators, including Peter Gabriel and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, lined up to champion his legacy. Rahat, then 23, was expected to quietly carry on the family tradition: a stoic commitment to devotional music. No one expected him to become a blockbuster entity in his own right. \u201cThat journey hasn\u2019t been easy,\u201d he says, looking over the canal from the Guardian offices, \u201cit\u2019s hard for artists to get real respect at home. There is little value placed on what we do.\u201d India, he says, has been kinder, which goes some way to explain the 100 or so songs he has recorded for the film industry there, among his 16-album discography. \u201cThe first song I wrote myself was Sab Jhoote [It\u2019s All Lies]. That was just three years ago, in Manhattan, coming back from a show and fed up with my management and the industry.\u201d Khan switches back and forth between English and Urdu as he speaks. After such disillusionment with the music industry, how does he trust anyone? \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who is fake and who is true, who is playing politics and trying to stab you in the back. You\u2019ve got to be careful.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound much fun. What about actual politics? He must get courted by the nation\u2019s ruling elite, or have an opinion on Pakistan\u2019s political weather? \u201cMy responsibility is to the music and the industry. I stay in my lane. You\u2019ve got to keep laughing, greet them politely and play the game. That\u2019s the way to deal with them.\u201d     Rahat Fateh Ali Khan on stage.

If you have ever wondered what it\u2019s like to jump from one Dubai skyscraper to another in a car \u2013 and more importantly, what it means about your relationship with your mother \u2013 this is the hot metal cinematic experience for you. And, yes, obviously I\u2019ve watched them all. But that\u2019s not important right now, because there is beef on the set of its newest iteration, Fast 8. Chances are your response to that is: \u201cUm, yes? The movie stars Vin Diesel, The Rock, Jason Statham, Ludacris, Scott Eastwood \u2026 Self-evidently there is beef. It is a beef farm. Or rather, a mechanically recovered beef processing plant, where you would probably rather not partake of the wares on offer.\u201d Yet wait \u2013 because I\u2019m not talking about that kind of beef. This is the other beef: aggro beef, conflict beef, the kind of beef where franchise star The Rock posts a late-night, lengthy social media rant this week, and it isn\u2019t just a stream of tenuously coherent hashtags like #30repsaminute #projectburn #justbringit #bloodsweat&amp;respect #crushthefear #betterneverstops #bringonthegreat. (Actually, the last two are the most recent official slogans for Team GB \u2013 I believe they use The Rock\u2019s discarded workout tweets as their official branding agency.) And so to The Rock\u2019s 95 Theses. Beneath a short clip of him throwing some chap against a wall, he began by saluting the movie\u2019s crew and \u201cmy female co-stars\u201d. \u201cMy male co-stars however are a different story,\u201d he went on. \u201cSome conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don\u2019t. The ones that don\u2019t are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses.\u201d Oof. As Bismarck once pointed out, those who like sausages and enjoy the Fast &amp; Furious franchise should never see either being made. But there was more, including an insight into The Rock\u2019s process for which Inside the Actors Studio would kill. \u201cWhen you watch this movie next April,\u201d The Rock revealed, \u201cand it seems like I\u2019m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling \u2013 you\u2019re right.\u201d Clearly, cinematic historians will come to view this post as the Hearts of Darkness to Fast 8\u2019s Apocalypse Now. In the meantime, I hope The Rock takes a crumb of comfort from the fact that he is in a line of work where he is able to channel his raging desire to throw people into a wall into the role of a raging man who throws people into a wall. More pressingly, though, what of said co-workers? If anything, the international media have underplayed the outburst, reporting simply that it \u201csent shockwaves round the world\u201d, and declaring that The Rock\u2019s fellow Fast 8 stars were furious that \u201cthey are all suspects\u201d. Quite. There were still several days of filming left. They didn\u2019t know whether it was their ass being watched for signs of candy. I can\u2019t even imagine the strain of living in that type of paranoia-inducing closed environment, let alone shooting a scene where a car has to headbutt a Chinook, and you daren\u2019t even ask what your motivation for screaming NOOOOOOOOOO is, in case you\u2019re being scoped. That set can have been nothing less than the panopticon of candyassery. Consequently, some of The Rock\u2019s co-stars broke early and in ways that were painful to watch. Tyrese Gibson was so anxious not to be identified as the candy ass that he posted a film of The Rock singing to his young daughter accompanied by the observation: \u201cA man wouldn\u2019t be singing with his heart and soul to another man\u2019s little angel if he had a problem with her dad.\u201d I literally can\u2019t think of a more candy-assed reaction. But Tyrese didn\u2019t seem to be the candy ass in question. After a couple of days of fevered speculation, reports finally zeroed in on the candy ass in question \u2013 and, would you believe, it is said to be none other than Vin Diesel himself. Clearly, this is a lot to take in. This, after all, is Vin Diesel \u2013 real name Mark Sinclair \u2013 who, from the get-go, selected the pretend surname Diesel over something flashy like Vin Petrol or Vin Gasoline. That sent a humble message. It suggested he was hard-working, might retain his value better over time, but mainly represented a sensible, cheaper choice for the economically minded auteur. And I\u2019d like to think Vin\u2019s canon has borne that out. But now \u2013 well, has there been a higher-camp movie feud in years? On screen, these tattooed hardmen may square up tit-to-tit, a stack-heeled Diesel in the honorary Bruce Willis vest that hasn\u2019t been washed since Die Hard, and The Rock in some sort of wired-up gilet that says: \u201cI\u2019m a law-enforcement operative who understands that sometimes rules have to be broken.\u201d (Incidentally, given the height difference between the two, I\u2019m not sure how the eye-to-eye contact is achieved. In Hollywood days of yore, some short actors used to stand on steps to tower over their female co-stars, but Alan Ladd made the Boy on a Dolphin crew dig a hole for Sophia Loren to stand in. Is Vin on a box or is The Rock in a hole? I\u2019d appreciate someone from the set getting in touch to clarify.) Anyway, off-screen the story is surely different. The pair are \u2013 how to put this kindly? \u2013 actors.

Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, was strangled to death while visiting her family in northern Punjab last month. Her husband, Mukhtar Syed Kazam, said he believed his wife was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage. Shahid\u2019s first husband, Mohammad Shakeel, her father, Mohammad, and another cousin who are suspected of her murder are all on the run, according to Pakistani police. It is alleged that Shahid, 28, had been tricked into travelling to Pakistan in July and killed for divorcing her first husband and remarrying against the wishes of her family. The case, which has been highlighted by the Bradford West MP Naz Shah, has become a priority for Pakistan after the country\u2019s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, announced that he had ordered a rapid investigation. The Guardian has learned that a journalist in Pakistan, who has been investigating Shahid\u2019s death, has made a formal complaint to police after allegedly receiving death threats from a British man. Raja Waqar said he received five disturbing phone calls in which he was told he would be killed and his children would also be harmed if he continued to pursue information about Shahid\u2019s murder. During the phone calls, the longest of which is said to have lasted eight minutes, Waqar said he was told: \u201cIf you carry on doing this I\u2019m going to kill you and your children.\u201d Waqar, who works for the AAJ TV station in Karachi, says he began receiving calls from a British mobile phone number on 24 July. The calls, from a man who only identified himself as Ali, continued for two days and became increasingly disturbing, he said. Speaking from Pakistan, Waqar said: \u201cWhen I started covering this story I started receiving threats from a man called Ali. He was ringing on an English mobile number. \u201cHe asked me why I was covering the story and I told him that as a journalist in the area for the past 15 years, it was my duty to cover the story and that I had smelled that this was not a natural death. \u201cHe told me to drop the story and when I refused he said he was going to kill me and my children.\u201d Waqar was told by his bureau chief at the TV station to contact the police and filed a complaint in writing. He said: \u201cThis was my assignment and I was not going to allow him to threaten me. But after he kept calling and telling me to stop I had to call the police. He told me to leave it because Samia was not my sister but it was very clear to me that she had been murdered- I have no doubt about it.\u201d A West Yorkshire police spokesman said: \u201cWe are aware of a report of a Pakistan-based journalist who has allegedly been receiving threats. They have reported this matter to the Pakistani police.\u201d He added: \u201cWest Yorkshire police is currently reviewing all previous contact with Samia Shahid, including any alleged criminal offences and the action taken as a result. Her death remains a matter for the Pakistani authorities and we are continuing to liaise with them and with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\u201d Shahid returned to Bradford from Dubai, where she had been living with Kazam, her second husband, last September to try to build bridges with her family. She asked a female police officer to chaperone her to the family home in Manningham, Bradford, after allegedly being harassed by one of her relatives who wanted her to return to her first marriage. West Yorkshire police confirmed that a man received a harassment warning following the meeting but the force declined to identify the offender. Shahid\u2019s friends in Bradford said the beauty therapist was not frightened for her life but was increasingly stressed about what some relatives were telling her mother and father. \u201cI could tell from her Snapchats that she was really affected by her relatives saying stuff to her family, her parents,\u201d one friend said. \u201cShe was saying \u2018People can\u2019t keep their nose out of things\u2019.\u201d She added: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a scared person. It would take a lot for her to fear stuff. She felt, \u2018Why are they doing stuff like that?\u2019 but I don\u2019t think she was scared because she is a strong person in her character. \u201cShe was just stressed for her family \u2013 she didn\u2019t want her parents to be stressed out because of what her relatives were doing. That was her main concern [rather] than being scared for herself.\u201d Shahid\u2019s family in Bradford claimed she had died from natural causes on 20 July and police initially said there were no visible injuries on her body.

A 19th-century oratory designed to resemble a Greek-Doric temple; a disused Victorian brewery beneath which there lies a lake some 40ft deep; a long abandoned art deco cinema, its ruby interior frozen in time as if its patrons, dressed in their Saturday best, might return at any moment: these are just a few of the city\u2019s more extraordinary buildings, beautiful and mournful in almost equal measure. And also, more to the point, empty and available. But therein lies the catch, of course. If art is not to be upstaged by architecture, the work must either be truly extraordinary, or so powerfully bound to its site that the two can hardly be separated.    At my feet swirled little piles of litter: plastic bottles and cigarette butts, receipts and ringpulls    Alas, this is a principle the directors of the Liverpool Biennial, now in its ninth \u201cedition\u201d, have more or less ignored, if it was ever in their minds at all. Much of the work they have commissioned (44 projects on 22 sites, for the bargain price, I was told, of \u00a3800,000) is not only of dubious quality, but so barely in conversation with the structures that house it as to be insulting \u2013 a state of affairs that seems, at least in part, to stem from the decision to present the whole thing as a series of \u201cepisodes\u201d. In other words, where there might have been one overarching theme, or none at all, the art is bunched clumsily under six different titles: Ancient Greece, Chinatown, Children\u2019s Episode, Software, Monuments from the Future, and Flashback. The first two connect directly to Liverpool, a city whose great 19th-century architects, John Foster (designer of the aforementioned oratory) and Harvey Lonsdale Elmes (St George\u2019s Hall), created for it a wondrous neoclassical cityscape, and whose Chinese community is the oldest in Europe; the third speaks to the need for a programme like this to be educational. But the thinking behind the others remains obscure even after you\u2019ve struggled through the waffle in the official guide (\u201cflashbacks can rupture established narratives\u2026\u201d). Why did anyone imagine this might be a good idea? It\u2019s an organisational and intellectual mess.     The Oratory, by John Foster, in Liverpool. Photograph: Oleksander Burlaka    And the mess doesn\u2019t end there. I went first, in a great rush, to the Oratory, at the entrance to the Anglican cathedral, which I\u2019ve never found open before \u2013 and if I was disappointed by the new work on display (its well intentioned but visually tedious centrepiece is a video, Rubber Coated Steel, by Lawrence Abu Hamdan, based on audio files recording the disputed killing of two boys in the occupied West Bank), I was swiftly charmed by the funeral monuments that are (permanently) kept there. \u201cHER ONLY DESIRE FOR HERSELF WAS THAT AT THE RESURRECTION HER LORD MIGHT SAY \u2018SHE HATH DONE WHAT SHE COULD,\u2019\u201d it says, beneath an angel carved in memory of Agnes Elizabeth Jones, who nursed the workhouse sick. But then I looked down. At my feet swirled little piles of litter: plastic bottles and cigarette butts, receipts and ringpulls. And it seemed to follow me around, this detritus. Only when I arrived, much later, at Tate Liverpool, whose Biennial gallery appeared not to have been swept in days, did I discover that this was not really rubbish, but a piece entitled What the Living Do, by an American artist Jason Dodge. Wow. If such a bit of mindless decadence appeared in a satirical novel about the contemporary art world, wouldn\u2019t you feel the writer had gone way too far?     Krzysztof Wodiczko\u2019s Homeless Vehicle: \u2018You find yourself thinking, if only momentarily: this could work\u2026\u2019 Photograph: Jon Barraclough    From the Oratory, I ducked into the lovely old ABC cinema on Lime Street, where a collection of seemingly random sculptures and assemblages loitered in the gloom while various unfathomable films (by Samson Kambalu, and Fabien Giraud and Rapha\u00ebl Siboni) played on; and then I headed for FACT on Wood Street, where a survey of work by the Polish-born artist Krzysztof Wodiczko, explores human displacement. This was better. What\u2019s disturbing about his Homeless Vehicle (1988), a metal cylinder balanced on a trolley in which a human being can sleep, eat and store his few possessions, is that you find yourself thinking, even if only momentarily: this could work. It is, then, a piece that first provokes and then shames, leaving you with a queasy sense of your own complacency.     \u2018Feeble\u2019: Betty Woodman\u2019s A Visit to Rome (2016), installed at George\u2019s Dock. Photograph: Joel Chester      It's grotesquery for grotesquery's sale, The League of Gentlemen minus the wit    Unfortunately, my newly stirred mood didn\u2019t last long. A Visit to Rome (2009), a bronze fountain by the American artist Betty Woodman, which supposedly nods not only to classical imagery but also to Matisse and Picasso, looks so feeble \u2013 not so much primitive as rickety \u2013 dwarfed as it is by the George\u2019s Dock ventilation tower, the art deco marvel of Portland Stone the architect of which, Herbert J Rowse, was influenced by the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. And then there was the display upstairs at the nearby Open Eye gallery. Rain Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian are three Iranian artists who live together in Dubai, and who make sculptures \u2013 I use the term loosely \u2013 and performance art. In this instance, they\u2019d dressed up as three \u201csubmersibles\u201d, Anti-Catty, Space Sheep and Princess Rambo, and then filmed themselves at play. One goofs around with a load of animal trotters. Another, in a frilly dress and a pig mask, keeps giving birth to a watermelon. It\u2019s grotesquery for grotesquery\u2019s sake, like something out of The League of Gentlemen, minus the wit and the drama.     \u2018A cat\u2019s cradle of laser beams\u2019: Rita McBride\u2019s Portal (2016) at Toxteth Reservoir. Photograph: Joel Chester    Things only picked up when I headed out of the city centre in the direction of Toxteth (by this time, I\u2019d visited 10 of a planned 14 sites). Cains Brewery is, I think, a missed opportunity, its cavernous canning hall having been filled with a muddle of too-small stuff connecting to a number of \u201cepisodes\u201d: more of Dodge\u2019s garbage, more repulsive bewilderments courtesy of Rain Haerizadeh and co, and Outdoors (2016) by the Indian artist Sahej Rahel, a mass of roughly worked and fantastical clay sculptures that \u201cbelong within a burgeoning mythology\u201d. But I enjoyed seeing Rita McBride\u2019s (another American) installation in the dank dark of the Victorian Toxteth Reservoir, a cat\u2019s cradle of laser beams that somehow hints at time travel, and I adored the Italian artist Lara Favaretto\u2019s Momentary Monument \u2013 The Stone (2016), which stands among boarded-up terraces in Rhiwlas Street. This piece, a huge block of granite, is \u2013 at last! \u2013 deep in conversation with its context. Like the street around it, its only entry point is a letter box-like slot; its future, in common with that of the terraces before they were finally saved (they\u2019re shortly to be renovated), lies with the wrecking ball that will destroy it once the Biennial is over. In its simplicity there is abiding strength, and it brought a lump to my throat. As to what local people make of it, though, I cannot say. In the late afternoon sunshine, two small boys arrived on their bicycles. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said one, settling to sit, rather pertly, on a nearby doorstep. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d I said, aiming for nonchalance.

The colt beat Vadamos in a hot renewal of the contest by an official half\u2011length but in fact won with authority. Fahey, who said Ribchester was the best horse ever to be seen at his North Yorkshire stable, was also scoring a notable landmark by winning a Group One prize for Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin operation \u2013 an achievement disappointingly infrequent for Godolphin\u2019s in-house training establishments at Newmarket. The celebrations at Malton were heightened by the success coming just before the start to the big Ebor festival at York on Wednesday. Local excitement had already been raised by David O\u2019Meara\u2019s stable \u2013 seven miles east of York \u2013 winning the Arlington Million in Chicago on Saturday evening with Mondialiste, ridden by Danny Tudhope. Back in eighth place at Arlington was the Newmarket-trained Godolphin runner Tryster, whose jockey, William Buick, could well have been in a disconsolate mood during an overnight flight back across the Atlantic. Partnering Ribchester at Deauville would have changed all that. Buick has been particularly determined to reward his Dubai-based employers since returning at the start of August from a 30-day ban imposed in France. \u201cIt\u2019s a great thrill to win one of the most prestigious races in France and it shows that he might have been unlucky in the Sussex, when I didn\u2019t ride him,\u201d Buick said. \u201cWe were going away at the finish. He is one of the best milers I\u2019ve ridden, for sure.\u201d Fahey said: \u201cRibchester\u2019s incredible and came here in top form. Next year he could be the real deal. He\u2019s the best we\u2019ve ever had, he\u2019s got everything. He has a lot of class and a lot of speed. It looked like he was going to win easily, but he had to battle a bit, and that\u2019s good as it will help him to mature. \u201cWe were very worried about the [low] draw, because the ground appeared to be a fair bit quicker on the far side, but needn\u2019t have been. He will probably go to Ascot now for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.\u201d   Related: Mondialiste wins Arlington Million for British trainer David O\u2019Meara    Galileo Gold, a brilliant winner of the 2,000 Guineas and the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes, was a warm favourite at Deauville but finished eighth of the 11 runners. He took up the lead soon after the start and failed to settle for Frankie Dettori. Harry Herbert, the racing manager for the owners Al Shaqab Racing, said: \u201cHe was just too free early and had no cover. Ideally it would have been nice to follow something, but he got very lit up and ran with the choke out. \u201cHe was very relaxed before the race, but completely out of rhythm in front on a straight track, where there\u2019s nowhere to hide. Let\u2019s see how he comes out of it, but I think he can have a mini-break and then we can look to run in the QEII.\u201d It was Andr\u00e9 Fabre\u2019s Vadamos that proved the biggest challenge to Ribchester, but the five-year-old could not match the finishing speed of Fahey\u2019s charge. At York, officials reported the advance going for the four-day Ebor meeting as good-to-firm and said the track had been watered. The big race on Wednesday is the Group One Juddmonte International Stakes over 10 furlongs. The hot favourite at 5-4 is the Roger Varian-trained Postponed, with Godolphin\u2019s Hawkbill, trained by Charlie Appleby next in at 7-2. There are plenty of others with chances. Among the rank outsiders is Almodovar, whose shrewd trainer, David Lanigan, was clearly of the opinion on Sunday that his four-year-old, priced around 25-1 and 33-1, should not be regarded as a no-hoper. Almodovar ran very well at Royal Ascot, over 12 furlongs, Lanigan said, but had not stayed the trip: \u201cThat took a bit out of him, which is why he hasn\u2019t run since.

It is traditional for any Olympic Games to be followed at a seemly distance by photo-stories detailing the slide into disuse of the various eye-wateringly expensive venues in the host city. In the case of Rio this seems to be happening concurrently, live on air alongside the marquee track and field events. Banks of empty seats are visible at every venue for every event. Even strategically placed TV cameras can\u2019t disguise it, as they often do. As the opening session of the athletics competition began last Friday, there were more media than spectators in the stadium, giving it the flavour of a Test match relocated to Abu Dhabi or Dubai for security reasons. Whose fault is this? Contrary to the title of a standout movie even among Michael Caine\u2019s remarkable 1980s oeuvre, I cannot Blame It On Rio. (Reminder: what a motion picture). Call me old fashioned, call me off-brand, but I still think of \u201cRio\u201d as a city of more than six million people, huge numbers of them destitute, rather than an Olympic organising committee. The latter is responsible, the IOC \u2013 as the old hands in all this \u2013 more so. Its profiteering mega-event has never looked more distasteful or exploitative.   Related: Empty seats all around Rio 2016 Olympic Stadium as athletics get underway    Any pre-Games suggestion that you simply could buy in Rio\u2019s fabled \u201ccarnival atmosphere\u201d has been proved wrong as never before, and organisers do not even appear to be able to make good on a wan promise to open the empty seats up to schoolchildren. Can tickets for Rio Olympics literally not be given away? It is unclear, but seems to be the case. The problem is variously denied, ignored, described as one of VIPs not turning up because of security or refreshment delays, or only turning up for one event in a long session. Most recently, the organising committee had a new excuse, saying that a lot of people were buying tickets but only using them to have a look around the Olympic Park, leaving before they\u2019d seen any sport. (If you\u2019re near a TV camera, do a WTF-tinged sideways glance at it now.) A colleague over in Rio describes local bars with TVs all pointedly tuned out of the Olympics, unless it is for Brazil\u2019s participation in the football tournament. Which principled stand I admire hugely. In their city, the varying degrees of scandal that attend every major modern sporting event could not be more infuriatingly obvious. The sporting industrial complex isn\u2019t pretty at the best of times in booming first world locations. In Rio it plays out like a particularly hallucinogenic question in Family Fortunes. We asked 100 people in Rio to name something they wanted, to which the answers were obviously things like \u201csanitation\u201d and \u201cfood\u201d, but the imbecilic contestant hazards: \u201cA canoe slalom venue?\u201d The recherch\u00e9 nature of many Olympic sports and the specific facilities they demand read like especially vicious satires on late-stage capitalism when you consider the appalling deprivation so nearby. For my own part, to survey the future white elephants deserted even during competition is to be slightly reminded of being on the most recent general election trail, where (aside from the SNP) the major parties shunned contact with the real public in favour of \u201crallies\u201d in sanitised, non-public spaces like business parks, or closed factory floors. It all felt like a pseudo-event \u2013 something that would not happen were the TV cameras not there. As the vast, vast majority of humans who don\u2019t travel to World Cups or the Olympics, but watch them on TV, will always tell you: these things could really be happening anywhere. Apart from the gorgeous sweeping camera shots of the various cities used to frame coverage, what is local about the Olympics any more? Certainly not the audience. The obvious solution would be so detrimental to the real business of the Olympics \u2013 money-grubbing \u2013 that it is never arrived at. Yet the Olympics are in this age permanently dysfunctional on the road. There is no decent or realistic moral argument for not permanently homing the summer Games in Greece (and the winter ones somewhere sensationally rich and alpine). The winners in this would include the Greeks, and all the future non-host cities who would save billions. The viewing public would barely notice.   Related: Rio 2016 Olympics: best ever away Games for Team GB is 'worst flop' for China \u2013 live!    Alas, the major losers in this arrangement are an all-powerful cabal. They include the zero-tax IOC, local politicians/presidents of varying degrees of corruption and megalomania, who use the Olympics to clamber inside the dictatorship simulator and be the version of their country they\u2019d be if they weren\u2019t repressed by quotidian encumbrances such as a constitution (traditionally overridden for a Games). Or, indeed, who use them as the curtain-raiser to annexing the Crimea. Also on the list: construction firms and their opaque contract inducements, and the global class of corrupt officials who use these five-star hospitality events to do their ghastly business.

How the hell did they pull that off?   But pull it off they have, and how. The professional darts circuit stages a hugely-supported, high-rating, broadcast-live-in-several-countries world series of darts. It\u2019s a made-for-television mega-operation with raucous tournaments in Dubai, Shanghai, Auckland, Glasgow, Perth and Tokyo.   We\u2019re here at \u201cThe Star\u201d in Sydney among upwards of 1500 merry Sydney-siders dressed as convicts and pirates and super heroes and Ghostbusters. Friday and Saturday they\u2019ll get 2000 \u2013 as good as sold out. The format pits a travelling top eight of darts champions against the host country\u2019s best local talent. And for one Tasmanian 21-year-old, it means tossing arrows against a legend.  Corey Chadby is the \u201cnew sensation\u201d of Aussie darts because he\u2019s 21 and very good. His old man was a darts player and his old man before him, and there\u2019s a huge mob of family up from Tasmania in \u201cTeam Cadby\u201d T-shirts. They call him \u201cThe King\u201d. His darts are 24 gram tungsten torpedoes. And if he continues on his current trajectory, he\u2019s Aussie darts\u2019 next big thing.  Yet it wasn\u2019t until five years ago that Chadby was allowed to play competitively. \u201cMy father wouldn\u2019t let me play until I was sixteen, until I could count and chalk,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been basically throwing darts since I was five years old.\u201d  Cadby competes on the Dartplayers Australia (DPA) tour, from which he wins an income capable of supporting his little family \u2013 partner, two-year-old, 7-month-old. Not bad for a 21-year-old travelling Australia throwing little spears.  Yet the real money is in Europe. It\u2019s in his plans. \u201cThat\u2019s the dream, mate,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s everyone\u2019s dream. So I\u2019m going finish off the Aussie circuit and have a word to the missus. In the DPA, you travel all over Australia. It\u2019s a good experience though you get sick of planes. \u201cBut mate I\u2019ve lived off it the last 12 months. It supports my family, that\u2019s the main thing.\u201d  So what\u2019s the plan? \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep playing like I am, and keep practising. And let the darts do the talking.\u201d     Phil \u2018The Power\u2019 Taylor hams it up before the Sydney Darts Masters. Photograph: Pacific Pres/REX/Shutterstock     Cadby trains every day, looking to get down from 501 in the least number of three-dart throws. He\u2019ll do that for an hour, then take a break. Then he\u2019ll practice for another hour. That\u2019s his day. Unlike the cliche of the heavy-drinking arrow man, Cadby keeps largely to himself. \u201cI\u2019m a family man,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t go out much.\u201d   And good luck to him \u2013 because he\u2019ll need it. For tonight, in his first time on television, he\u2019s about to take on the awesome Phil \u201cThe Power\u201d Taylor, the greatest darts player there\u2019s ever been. Even non-darts folk have heard of The Power; sixteen-time world champion; eleven World Grand Prix titles. He is the Bradman, Jordan and Gretsky of darts. And he looks like a lawn bowler from Woy Woy.  We head out among the crowd of Mormons and Trumps and Space Rangers and nuns and Tellytubbies to watch the first match: local boy Rhys Mathewson \u2013 aka \u201cMuffo\u201d: 21g Spectres, resident of Hoppers Crossing near former state research farm at Werribee \u2013 taking on James \u201cThe Machine\u201d Wade and his 20g Unicorns.   The pair trade 180s, and the caller man\u2019s larynx rasps long into the night: \u201cOne hundred and eiiiiiggghhtttyyyyyyy\u201d. It\u2019s like he\u2019s giving birth to something. Something very big. And up they go, the Wallies and Ghostbusters and that alien dog thing from that \u201880s show, ALF, all leaping about in the way of these things. And it\u2019s good to be at the darts.  Things go to script in the match with The Machine out to a 5-2 lead in the best of 11 sets. But he misses a match-winning dart and our man Muffo wins the next three legs to square it up 5-all. When Mathewson hits his fifth 180 of the match followed by double-20, it completes a sensational win for the local lad, knocking off one of the big boys 6-5. It\u2019s the first time this world tour season one of the challengers has knocked off a champ. The Australian media dude in the room punches the air repeatedly. Seems it\u2019s kind of a big deal.   Related: Away Days: boxer Joseph Parker's Rumble in Paradise thrills Samoa     \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Mathewson tells compere Paul Gow afterwards. \u201cI felt comfortable up there and I wasn\u2019t nervous, but usually when you miss your doubles against James you don\u2019t get another chance. I thought I was in trouble at 5-2, but fortunately he gave me a chance and I took it. It\u2019s amazing for me.\u201d  A few matches later, the one we\u2019ve come to see \u2013 The Power versus The King. Cadby comes out through a ruck of punters. He\u2019s hugging mates, waving, urging on the crowd. How about this for a young man? First time on television in front of a crowd a hundred times bigger than anything he\u2019s ever known. But he\u2019s into it, this big chunk of Tasmania with his Travis Bickle haircut and voluminous shirt. \u201cCome on!\u201d he urges the people. And come they do, bubbling about like so much fizzy drink.  And here cometh The Power, and the joint loses its mind. \u201cThere\u2019s only one, Phil Taylor,\u201d they sing to acclaim the great man, dancing about and drinking beers and revelling in the craic. Taylor takes the stage, waves, slightly stooped, shirt untucked, ambles up for his first three throws and boom \u2013 \u201cOne hundred and eightyyyyyyyyy,\u201d yells the raspy-throated announcer man, and the joint is a cauldron of sound.  When Cadby answers with his own \u201cOne hundred and eightyyyyyyyyy\u201d and punches the sky, his supporters are up as one. \u201cCome on Corey! Smash him!\u201d implores one mate. \u201cSmash hiiiiim!\u201d And so it goes, the pair of arrow-men trading 180s as Mormons dance with Power Rangers and groups of nuns scull beer and cheer. The air is thick with irony and incongruity. It\u2019s great.  Eventually, and though Cadby has his moments, The Power cleans him up, six legs to three. Cadby souvenirs the board and asks for a photo with Taylor. There\u2019s some chat with media before we corner him out the back. He\u2019s still sweating slightly. He looks his 21 years. But he\u2019s smiling still.   How was that? He shakes his head. \u201cMate, 21-year-old and I\u2019m playing against the greatest darts player there\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s unbelievable, mate. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d  That it is.

Related: Nawaz Sharif in the driving seat in battle to be Pakistan's PM    Heritage campaigners launched a legal bid to block work on the Orange line project in January after learning that concrete elevated tracks would swoop past the 17th-century Shalimar Gardens, spoil views of the four-towered Chauburji gatehouse and carve off the front lawn and porch of the Raj-era General Post Office. Even if the court\u2019s decision is overturned on appeal, it is a blow to the ruling faction of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) led by the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, which had hoped to complete work on the flagship project in time for its re-election bid, likely to happen in 2018. The government is also keen to prove to China that it is able to execute big projects.

After releasing 2011\u2019s Human Revolution \u2013 a lavishly depicted near-future thriller \u2013 to widespread critical acclaim, developer Eidos Montreal\u2019s follow up, Mankind Divided, picks up the exact same threads that its predecessor left tantalisingly unanswered five years ago. \nThis is a tall order and its makers clearly recognise it, front-ending the game\u2019s campaign with an almost laughably long 12-minute recap to bring you up to speed on everything Deus Ex. Protagonist Adam Jensen returns \u2013 still half-Lagerfeld, half-Motorola Razr \u2013 working as a special agent at Interpol two years after the events of Human Revolution. Like many, he\u2019s coming to terms with the devastating aftereffects of The Incident \u2013 a cyber-attack that deliberately caused the bio-technologically \u201caugmented\u201d population to turn violent against their will, leaving millions dead. It was a global catalyst, accelerating the divisions between the human and augmented populations, but as thematically charged a setup as this is, Adam and his world can\u2019t help but feel outdated. \nMankind Divided is undeniably beautiful, soaked in the neon golds and vibrant lights that made its predecessor such a striking spectacle, but its weak opening results in a slow start that never quite gains the momentum it needs. When it does finally get going, some shoddy voice work and awful facial animations make for a game that fails to convey the societal and racial messages that its strong writing attempts to. \n \n  \n  \n  After a pre-credits mission in Dubai sets up the game\u2019s central conspiracy, you relocate to Prague. \n  Photograph: The Guardian \n  \n \nWorse yet, it offers very few notable opinions on its focal prejudices, and the best it seems to do to force home its messaging is interrupt you with annoying documentation checks between metro stations. There\u2019s racist graffiti on the walls, slurs get shouted as you walk through the streets, but the overall result is a social commentary that feels, at best, lacking conviction. \nAfter a pre-credits mission in Dubai sets up the game\u2019s central conspiracy, you relocate to Prague; a rich, multifaceted hub full of apartment blocks, a bank, abandoned theatre and underground anti-terrorism facility. Prague never imposes the same visual impact as Human Revolution\u2019s depiction of Hengsha or Detroit, but it is explored and revisited several times in different visual states over the game\u2019s 20-25 hours, and it\u2019s a veritable playground of stuff to do. Between the various metro stations that transport you to each corner of the capital, you\u2019ll find multiple side quests that are multi-part branching path adventures in themselves. There\u2019s a bank break-in to dig up dodgy info on one of the game\u2019s main mega-corps, and an investigation into an underground cult \u2013 finding every possible side story is a completionist dream, and the game makes pursuing these optional plots worthwhile with some great moments that rival the main story. \nThere are a couple of mainline departures from the Czech capital; an infiltration into Golem City \u2013 a cramped, higgledy-piggledy ghetto for the augmented that is by far the game\u2019s most interesting setting \u2013 as well as a recon mission to a facility in the Swiss Alps and a rescue mission in London. Despite these four locations, each far larger than anything in any Deus Ex previously, Mankind Divided doesn\u2019t feel half the grandiose globe-trotter that Human Revolution was. In some ways, this works in the game\u2019s favour, grounding itself to focus its story. In others, it results in a game that\u2019s half-baked, especially after proceedings aren\u2019t so much cut short as they are forcefully cauterised, resulting in the most telegraphed setup for a sequel since 2004\u2019s Halo 2. \n \n  \n  \n  Despite an improved control scheme, combat is still the least enjoyable way to play. \n  Photograph: The Guardian \n  \n \nBut, despite its terrible non-ending and the uninspiring boss fight that triggers it, the game still frequently finds immense strength in its moment-to-moment play. Mankind Divided retains the series\u2019 mechanical tri-force of stealth, hacking and combat, but it does a much better job of blending these different styles \u2013 even if you want to play stealthily, for example, you\u2019ll benefit from investing upgrade points into combat and hacking abilities to benefit from different routes that these styles allow. \nAfter setting up a narrative hard-reset of Adam\u2019s abilities, the resulting blank slate lets you experiment with the huge variety of augments and weapons. There\u2019s an invisibility cloak, smart vision for seeing through walls, a set of rebreather lungs for gas immunity, a social enhancer to open up more conversational options at certain points in the game, and lethal and non-lethal weapons aplenty. There are also new \u201coverclock\u201d augments, too, which Jensen uncovers when he undergoes surgery at the beginning of the game, including a gauss wrist attachment that sends enemies flying, a long-range taser, and a remote hacking tool that\u2019s incredibly useful when you\u2019re in a sticky spot. Coupled with your existing playthings, these eight over-clocked augments elevate Mankind Divided\u2019s depth beyond the strong foundations that Human Revolution laid out. \nThis leads to a more fluid role-playing experience, but one which suffers from many of the same pitfalls as its predecessor. Despite an improved control scheme, combat is still the least enjoyable way to play, and shooting just isn\u2019t as satisfying as it needs to be to become your primary choice. Similarly, hacking is still really empowering, allowing you to turn the tide by sabotaging turrets, controlling cameras remotely and manipulating walker robots to turn on your enemies, but the mini-game with which you hack terminals and computers isn\u2019t fun enough to justify how often you\u2019ll be doing it. \n \n  \n  \n  The multitude of options at almost every other stage of the game apart from the ending is impressive. \n  Photograph: The Guardian \n  \n \nRegardless of this, the open-ended nature of almost all missions means that you\u2019re rarely punished for whichever way you want to play \u2013 you will find that in moments where you have to hack something, for example, it won\u2019t require any upgrades to get past cybersecurity \u2013 and this makes for a game that begs to be played, manipulated and re-explored on several occasions, even despite its uneven core mechanics (something that the game\u2019s New Game Plus encourages, too). It\u2019s a disappointment that the game\u2019s biggest moments don\u2019t seem to have the multitude of outcomes that some of its smaller missions do; its grand finale seems to be the same no matter what your endgame decisions might be, but the multitude of options at almost every other stage of the game is impressive. \nAs a completely separate component from the main story, Breach mode adds time-trial style challenges. It\u2019s by no means a worthy replacement of, you know, the end of the story, but Breach has some cool ideas, online leaderboards and exclusive augmentations that aren\u2019t featured in the main game. \nIt\u2019s a shame that in a world obsessed with the conflict between man and machine, Mankind Divided\u2019s characters feel more robot than human. Hopefully, Eidos Montreal has strong post-release support planned to fill in the absent third act. Regardless of this, the game\u2019s broad level of creative opportunities, memorable infiltrations and beautiful attention to detail in such a visually interesting world make for a game that\u2019s fun to experiment with again and again, despite its structural cracks. \nPS4, Xbox One and PC; Pegi 18.

In contrast, in Rome you can pay up to \u20ac7 per person per night, he says, which works out at more than \u00a380 for two people if you\u2019re staying for a week.  It\u2019s generally hotels that charge city tax, according to Atkinson, as \u201csmall private accommodation tends to be exempt and stays at Airbnb seem to avoid it in some places, although Paris is one city where it must be collected\u201d. Once again, there are quirks in the system: in some places, including Cologne and Berlin, business travellers are exempt from the tax, and in Italy children under 14, (or 16 in some places), can be exempt.    In some cities payments go to supporting the local tourist industry and developing it, such as in Cologne    While you may think this is a sneaky way for hotels to boost their coffers, the money doesn\u2019t go directly into their pockets, although where it goes varies too. \u201cIn some cities payments go to supporting the local tourist industry and developing it, for example, in Cologne,\u201d says Atkinson. But in Italy the tax is used to \u201craise revenue for hard-pressed government departments\u201d.  In the Catalonia region of Spain where city tax has been in operation since 2012, it has raised a total of \u20ac126m, which has been split between the Catalan Tourism Agency, local tourism boards and town halls. Since July, the Spanish government has charged a new \u201ctourist tax\u201d on hotel stays in the Balearic Islands, which include Mallorca, Ibiza, Formentera and Menorca. It\u2019s charged at a rate of up to \u20ac2 per person per night, depending on the type of accommodation, and is collected by the hotel. The upper rate applies to four- and five-star hotels; you may only pay \u20ac1 a night if you\u2019re staying in a basic holiday apartment.  As city tax isn\u2019t an issue in the UK, holidaymakers heading abroad may easily be confused about whether it has already been included in their holiday price if they\u2019ve booked a package deal, or whether they need to save some money to cover this. Sean Tipton from ABTA, the group representing travel agents, says the basic rule is that \u201cany locally collected taxes, which includes city tax, won\u2019t be included as part of your package\u201d.

Budget flight company Jet2.com confirms that the tax isn\u2019t included in its city breaks packages and should be paid locally at the hotel. It says it warns customers upfront: \u201cWe notify customers when they book, and they have to tick a box to say that they\u2019ve read this.\u201d Details are also contained in Jet2\u2019s terms and conditions. Both Thomson and First Choice also say city tax (if levied at your destination) isn\u2019t included in package prices, adding, \u201cwe advise customers they are chargeable on arrival rather than included in the package price\u201d. If you\u2019re booking accommodation independently, check you read the hotel\u2019s website carefully, including details of any city tax charges. While these should all be listed \u2013 sites such as Booking.com put details alongside the room listing \u2013 it can be possible to spot the room rate, think you\u2019ve got a bargain and forget to factor in the extra costs. In most cases you can pay any tax due on departure, by cash or card. While city tax isn\u2019t an issue in the UK, Camden council did propose a form of a tourist tax last year to help with street cleaning, in the wake of government cuts.

After 13 games of the 1965-66 season the Robins were toiling in the middle of what was then called the Third Division and particularly underwhelming in attack, where they averaged precisely one goal per game, the second-worst record in the league. And then, suddenly, everything changed. To say they clicked would be to massively downplay what happened next, a transformation so extraordinary it would have Clark Kent demanding a smarter outfit and a better phone box. In their next five home games Swindon ran riot, scoring 25 times, before abruptly returning to normal once again. York were thrashed 6-0 on 19 October, Peterborough beaten 3-0 four days later, and the next visitors, Reading, suffered a 5-0 hiding. The No9, Jimmy Lawton, was in top form while Don Rogers, who scored once against Posh and hat-tricks in the other two games, was irrepressible. When Lawton strained a hamstring a day before the visit of Merthyr Tydfil in the first round of the FA Cup in November they were forced to change their front line, but the young reserve Keith East turned out to be better still. Thrown into the team at short notice he scored four times in a 5-1 win, and then proved it wasn\u2019t a fluke when, during the visit of Mansfield the next week, he managed five. Lawton did not play again until April, by which time East had 24 goals to his name.   Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend    It was the kind of achievement that always attracts interest in a young player, and towards the start of the following season top-flight Fulham moved in, only to move out again when Swindon increased their asking price at the last minute. Player and club fell out and in the end East went north, to Stockport County, who were on an ultimately successful title-winning charge in the Fourth Division. \u201cKeith East, a 22-year-old Swindon Town centre-forward, was transferred yesterday to Stockport County at an undisclosed fee,\u201d the Guardian reported. \u201cEast has played nine times for the first team this season and scored twice.\u201d It was the first time the Guardian had ever reported a transfer being concluded for an undisclosed fee. (The Times first applied the phrase to Harry Hood\u2019s move from Clyde to Celtic in 1969. The Mirror did not use it in the context of football until 1973, and that was in announcing Jimmy Hill\u2019s switch from ITV to the BBC. \u201cYou can say I\u2019ll be earning a few bob more than Malcolm Allison at the Palace, and they say he\u2019s on thirteen grand a year,\u201d was all the information the pundit would provide.) Times have changed. Between them the Guardian and the Observer reported 22 undisclosed fees in the 70s, 24 in the 80s, 61 in the 90s and 195 in the 2000s, and still the number rises. The Premier League\u2019s own list of deals completed so far this summer involving its clubs contains 13 signings for specific sums, 26 free transfers, 74 loans and 116 undisclosed fees. It is not hard to see the attraction of this financial secrecy, when the sums swilling around the English top flight are so gallingly stratospheric. Premier League clubs spent \u00a3859m in the summer 2015 transfer window, up from \u00a3835m in 2014 and \u00a3631m in 2013. Each September following the window\u2019s closure the sum is announced by television hosts pointing excitedly at blinking totalisers, a bit like Children in Need only without the children or the need. Soon, though, this will have to stop: it is harder to get excited about a question mark, however large we believe the number hiding behind it to be. The sport has discovered a taste for secrecy. Having successfully hidden their finances, footballers started hiding their faces, covering their mouths with their hands before they talk to each other in public. Whether on a beach in Dubai or a pitch in Manchester it seems they can only relax when there\u2019s a palm between them and the nearest camera.

Roger Lemerre and Didier Deschamps had a lengthy discussion on the pitch after the Euro 2000 final, prompting a French TV station to hire lip-readers and discover the national team captain\u2019s intention to retire \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m tired, so tired. I have a wife, a family, I don\u2019t want to make them suffer\u201d \u2013 and the coach\u2019s desperation to stop him, which must have been irritating. But there are two sides to this coin, with TV footage having been used on several occasions by footballers and their managers to defend themselves against charges of using offensive language. This, to be fair, isn\u2019t always totally successful: though the lip-reader hired by Arsenal\u2019s Patrick Vieira in 2002 convinced a disciplinary panel that he did not, as alleged, call the referee Andy D\u2019Urso \u201ca fucking wanker with no personality\u201d, they decided the only one of those words he hadn\u2019t used was the second and still gave him a two-match ban and a \u00a325,000 fine. So here we are. Every week millions of people, in person and on television, pay to watch the beneficiaries of undisclosed transfers have undisclosed conversations. But this is a road that leads to a dark and distrustful place, where teams play mystery matches against obscure opponents on private pitches, and the phrase \u201cclassified results\u201d takes on a different meaning entirely. Secrets are convenient but they are corrosive; a sport forever in the spotlight might wish we sometimes looked the other way, but every time they force us to do so some of us will decide not to turn back.", "title": "It is hard to get excited about a question mark hiding an undisclosed fee", "sentences": ["Whether on a beach in Dubai or a pitch in Manchester it seems they can only relax when there\u2019s a palm between them and the nearest camera."], "publicationDate": "2016-08-26T12:22:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/27/londoners-back-skyscraper-limit-skyline", "tags": ["London", "Architecture", "Heritage", "Art and design", "Culture", "UK news", "Cities", "The Thames"], "article": "Londoners want curbs placed on the number of new high-rise buildings in the capital, amid concerns that a wave of monolithic skyscrapers is transforming the skyline.   Related: A clear strategy on tall buildings can cut developers down to size | Rowan Moore    Six out of 10 support a limit on the height of new skyscrapers, with the same proportion backing restrictions on the number of buildings with more than 50 floors. The unprecedented survey, by Ipsos Mori, found that many Londoners, particularly those who live in the most affected areas, think the trend towards ever taller, bolder skyscrapers has gone too far. More than 400 buildings of more than 20 floors are in the pipeline in London, according to a recent report by New London Architecture and property consultant GL Hearn, which is twice as many as two years ago. The volume of projects in the offing has led to flashpoints as developers meet opposition from local communities. Architect Renzo Piano was forced to withdraw plans for a 72-storey tower in west London, dubbed the Paddington Pole, following outrage from campaigners. The heritage group Historic England recently lodged an objection to a proposed 25-storey tower of luxury flats in Somers Town, north London, citing its effect on views from Regent\u2019s Park. Barbara Weiss, architect and co-founder of the pressure group Skyline Campaign, said the glut of skyscrapers was down to a combination of borough councils trying to raise money and the desire by former mayor Boris Johnson to boost London\u2019s international profile.   Related: What a difference 400 years makes: the London skyline 1616 v 2016 \u2013 interactive    \u201cIt\u2019s partly austerity because boroughs are strapped for cash and can\u2019t run normal services. They need money; developers provide money,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cOn the other side was Boris with crazy ideas about London needing to be put on the map. He was encouraging these excesses and Londoners didn\u2019t know they were happening.\u201d The survey found that those who live in the city centre feel more strongly about the pace of development. Around half of those who live in inner London said too many high-rises were being built, with the figure falling to 34% among people outside the centre. That geographical divide was also reflected in views about the overall effect large buildings have on the city. Fears that tall buildings are \u201cdamaging what makes London special\u201d are shared by 43% of people in inner London but just 34% further away from the city centre. Nearly half of people in outer London said new skyscrapers were improving the capital\u2019s skyline, falling to 34% among central Londoners who are likely to live in their shadow. Differences in opinion between suburbanites and inner-city dwellers extend to views about what should be done to protect the skyline. Some 60% of inner Londoners would like new tall buildings limited to areas such as Canary Wharf and the City, while 53% from the suburbs support such a measure.     Boris Johnson didn\u2019t want a \u2018Dubai-on-Thames\u2019 when mayor but approved a wave of high-rises Photograph: Reuters    However, the poll found that Londoners largely agree that tall buildings are not the best way to solve the housing crisis. Terraced houses, low-rise blocks and converted flats were all regarded as better ways to meet the capital\u2019s housing needs. \u201cIn the right places tall buildings can make exciting contributions to city life,\u201d said a spokesperson for Historic England. \u201cBut denser, well-designed and lower developments which reflect the architectural traditions of London\u2019s different neighbourhoods could deliver even greater capacity for housing and workplaces.\u201d The character of London\u2019s skyline is also a political issue, with 31% of the 504 people surveyed saying they would be less likely to vote for a mayor who supported more tall buildings. Johnson has drawn criticism for approving a slew of high-rises, despite promising during his election campaign to stop London turning into \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d. Johnson\u2019s successor, Sadiq Khan, has spoken out against residential skyscrapers where flats stand empty because they are being used as \u201cgold bricks for investment\u201d by wealthy foreign investors. Khan and his housing team are still finalising details of the mayor\u2019s housing plans and are set to release more information in a housing policy paper due to be published in the autumn.   Related: London's changing skyline: planned tall buildings 'almost double in two years'    Weiss said allowing too many skyscrapers puts London \u201cat risk of losing its unique character \u2026 People who oppose these towers are saying they\u2019re not part of London\u2019s DNA. You can have a few in the right locations but if you have a lot of these ones that are badly designed and badly built, you\u2019ll end up with a generic city that could be absolutely anywhere. That\u2019s a real crime.\u201d Some developments have attracted particular opprobrium for their lack of affordable housing, such as One Blackfriars, known colloquially as the Boomerang. The building, to the south of Blackfriars bridge, includes a luxury apartment with a \u00a323m price tag, but has no \u201caffordable housing\u201d. The developer, St George, paid the council \u00a329m instead towards housing schemes elsewhere. \u201cLondon is on the cusp of profound change,\u201d said Historic England. \u201cWe are particularly concerned that over-development along the Thames could cut off Londoners and visitors from the river, which is the city\u2019s most ancient and important public space. It is time for a pan-London approach to tall buildings, with Londoners being better informed and involved in the changes that are gathering pace.

With a month to go until Darren Clarke oversees the defence of the trophy at Hazeltine the USA are heavily odds-on to win. The hosts\u2019 price shortened further on Tuesday as confirmation of Clarke\u2019s full team arrived. With Thomas Pieters afforded his most high-profile chance to shine, six from 12 of the European contingent will be making Ryder Cup debuts. That represents the highest rookie contingent for an away match since 1999, when the US triumphed with much leaping around and gnashing of teeth at Brookline. The home side is unlikely to feature more than two debutants and, in Brooks Koepka, may have only one.   Related: Thomas Pieters impresses me as much as Tiger Woods did, says Darren Clarke    Clarke did not adopt a woe is us approach or play on the sense of underdog when discussing his dozen. Europe\u2019s captain was at his most bullish yet with regards to the additions of Pieters, Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer. He explained his choices with reason and assuredness. \u201cWe have six rookies, one of them [Danny Willett] is the Masters champion,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThe other guys have won tournaments all over the world. \u201cWho would you have picked for experience? Who is in form? If I\u2019m going to add experience to it, I need to have form. I need to see guys that are playing well. Unfortunately, the two guys that would have fallen into that category, Graeme McDowell and Luke Donald, are not quite playing the way we know they can play. \u201cI would have loved them to be playing a little bit better to give me a bigger headache but it didn\u2019t happen. My options of adding to the team with strength then came back to rookies again. \u201cI\u2019m very, very pleased with Martin and Lee adding to the team because they bring a balance which we have always talked about. The last pick was always going to be the difficult one. \u201cYes, we have six rookies. I\u2019ve got all the trust in the world in them. They have got themselves in this position. It\u2019s not just a straightforward case; if it was, you would go straight down off the world rankings. That\u2019s not the European way. That\u2019s not what we do. \u201cI have a massive amount of belief in the rookies that we have. To put two together, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it but, if I did do that, then I would have confidence in them going out there and delivering a point.\u201d Clarke is right to point to Willett\u2019s status, although the Yorkshireman has been routinely out of sorts since his win at Augusta National in April. Questions, too, hover over the current touch of Andy Sullivan, Matthew Fitzpatrick and Chris Wood. \u201cI was part of that Brookline team and the rookies that we have now play more in America,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI don\u2019t mean any disrespect to the guys that didn\u2019t play until Sunday at Brookline, but the guys are global players nowadays. Those guys did play considerably around the world but it\u2019s different now. The rookies that we have now are more comfortable in America because they have been playing more over there, so it\u2019s somewhat different to what it was back then.\u201d Westwood was similarly upbeat. \u201cI see them not as rookies,\u201d said the 43-year-old. \u201cI look at a lot of the players\u2019 characters and I think they can take it. They can take a fight and a bit of stick.\u201d Indeed this wave of debutants is not necessarily a disaster for Europe. Quite obviously the core of a team that included McDowell, Donald and Ian Poulter for years would change at some point. That Westwood \u2013 who will compete in his 10th Ryder Cup and, with 21 points, is four behind Nick Faldo\u2019s record total \u2013 Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson are on hand to assist with the transition is a benefit to Clarke, himself immersed in the biennial event.   Related: Ryder Cup 2016: Westwood, Kaymer and Pieters selected as wildcard picks    The USA have players returning to familiar surroundings but the scar tissue associated with defeat upon defeat can hardly be deemed advantageous. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any other tournament,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something totally different but the experienced guys will do what we do in the European way by looking after the first-time guys. Making picks is not just about stats. It\u2019s not just about form, which is important, but it\u2019s about the whole team dynamic, what goes on behind the scenes. \u201cI\u2019ve consulted over this past couple of days with lots of previous Ryder Cup captains to try and just gain a little bit more of an insight and to see what they were thinking whenever they were making picks, in case I was doing anything that might not have fitted in, but every one of them was 100% behind me and very, very helpful. \u201cTheir thoughts on their picks were exactly the same as mine; you\u2019re adding to not just the playing, the playing bit is important, but you need more. Team is more important and the European team ethos is what has enabled us to be as successful as we have. With this team, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do and take this forward.\u201d Clarke batted away fitness fears regarding Stenson, who withdrew after one round of The Barclays Championship in New York last week with the recurrence of a knee problem. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Henrik two or three times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was purely precautionary; he is OK. I think he has a slight issue but it\u2019s not going to stop him playing.\u201d The overwhelming issue in Europe\u2019s favour is pressure; namely the barrowload of it placed on the USA. A miserable recent run \u2013 they have lost six of the past seven \u2013 triggered a task force, the inclusion of Tiger Woods as a vice\u2011captain and the apparent acceptance of the complaints so vociferously aired by Phil Mickelson at Gleneagles two years ago. Quite where the PGA of America would turn to in event of another defeat is anybody\u2019s guess. For now Davis Love has to decide on four picks with some big names in Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Matt Kuchar and Jim Furyk having failed to qualify automatically. Love will name three of his four on 12 September as he seeks to halt what would be an unprecedented fourth victory in a row for Europe. \u201cThankfully one of my hard parts of the job is over and done with but Davis has that ahead of him,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cHe\u2019s been there before and I\u2019m sure he will make very, very solid choices. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to have a tough decision to make. There are some big names not on that American team and they are going to consult with everybody, with members of the task force, to see what they are going to do. They have got to try and get the right mix on the team as well.\u201d None of which is Clarke\u2019s concern. On Tuesday,he exuded a level of confidence which, if transferred to Europe\u2019s players, offers a decent antidote to betting markets.

Abubakar Khuda Bakhsh, the head of a special team set up to investigate the death of Bradford-born Samia Shahid, said Aqeel Abbas, the station house officer of Mangla police station, was detained on \u201chard evidence of obstructing justice\u201d. \u201cHe helped people escape the country who were wanted in the case of Samia,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite clear instructions, he let them go.\u201d The police are seeking the return of Shahid\u2019s mother and sister to Pakistan for questioning. Bakhsh said his report alleges that Shahid was first raped by her former husband Chaudhry Shakeel and then strangled to death with the assistance of her father Muhammad Shahid on 20 July. Several family members are accused of conspiring to trick Shahid into travelling to Pandori, their ancestral village in Punjab province, on the pretext that her father was gravely ill. It is alleged that the family felt that Bradford-born Shahid had flouted the patriarchal culture and religious mores of small-town Punjab. Not only did she divorce Shakeel, a cousin she had been pressured into marrying, but she proceeded to marry Mukhtar Syed Kazam, a man who belonged to both a different clan and, as a Shia, a different Islamic sect. Kazam, fearing for her safety, had begged her not to travel from their home in Dubai to Pakistan, but she went on 14 July. Both Shakeel and Muhammad Shahid are currently being held on judicial remand and are likely to be formally charged at their next court hearing on September 8. In a country where a huge number of \u201chonour\u201d killings are thought to go unreported or unpunished, Shahid\u2019s case is unusual for attracting high-powered scrutiny. A special investigation team led by Bakhsh was set up by the chief minister of Punjab after Bradford MP Naz Shah raised her concerns with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister. Initially, local police had accepted the family\u2019s claims that the healthy 28-year-old had died of unknown causes on the stairs of her former husband\u2019s house in Pandori where her father, a Bradford businessman, holds influence. Abbas, the station house officer, initially told the Guardian and other media that there were no signs of physical injury on Shahid\u2019s body when it was discovered, but photos of her body and a leaked autopsy report later showed she was found with vivid bruising around her neck. \u201cFrom physical signs, it was clear she was strangled,\u201d said Bakhsh. \u201cA person like [Abbas], with 20 years\u2019 service, must have known that. He was playing it down.\u201d Another police official said Abbas is also believed to have accepted a payment of 500,000 rupees (\u00a33,600) from Shakeel and allowed him to leave. He later reappeared after acquiring \u201cpre-arrest bail\u201d, a legal move that hindered the police investigation. The inquiry team said they matched Shakeel\u2019s DNA to semen collected from Shahid\u2019s corpse, which suggested that she had been raped. Although her family have refused to acknowledge her divorce from Shakeel in 2014, Bakhsh said his team were satisfied that she was legally separated under British law.", "title": "Police officer investigating killing of Samia Shahid arrested", "sentences": ["Kazam, fearing for her safety, had begged her not to travel from their home in Dubai to Pakistan, but she went on 14 July."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-02T22:24:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/06/mexico-african-asian-migration-us-exit-permit", "tags": ["Migration and development", "Migration", "Global development", "US immigration", "Africa", "Asia Pacific", "Mexico", "Americas", "US news", "World news", "Refugees"], "article": " The sun has barely risen and already hundreds of migrants are gathered outside the vast white and green immigration detention centre, hoping to get through its gates. Most have travelled thousands of miles on foot, by boat and bus from South America, but few here speak Spanish. In front of the locked gates near Mexico\u2019s southern border, it\u2019s an eclectic mix of French, English, Creole, Urdu, Lingala and Somali. This eclectic crowd is part of a huge surge in African and Asian migrants traversing the Americas in hope of a better life in the US. The circuitous passage means paying thousands of dollars to coyotes \u2013 or people smugglers \u2013 to cross 10 countries, where overcrowded fishing boats, mosquito-infested jungles, armed bandits and immigration agents await.     A child waits in front of the immigration center in Tapachula for an exit permit to the US. Photograph: Encarni Pindado for the Guardian    Despite the dangers, about 7,882 Africans and Asians presented themselves at Mexican immigration in the first seven months of this year \u2013 86% higher than in the whole of 2015 and more than four times the number registered in 2014. At the end of August, Tapachula\u2019s immigration registered 424 Africans in just two days. Over the past decade, Latin America has become an increasingly popular route of entry to the US for Asian and African migrants, but the current surge in numbers is unprecedented.  The numbers are still tiny compared to the hundreds of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty, but the treacherous route crossing Latin America is becoming increasingly popular as people from across the world seek new ways to reach the US.  The vast majority arrive in the city of Tapachula near the Guatemalan border, without a visa or even a passport. But unlike Central Americans, these migrants can obtain a temporary travel document which allows them to continue unimpeded to the US border since Mexico has no deportation agreements with their countries.  \u2018We saw a dead man without head or hands\u2019 By 8am, it\u2019s already fiercely hot outside the immigration center and there are too few shady trees for the growing crowd. To kill time, people listen to music on their phones or discuss the best ways to travel north. Those with money will fly to the Mexican cities of Tijuana, Matamoros or Mexicali, others will risk several days on buses through states plagued by organised crime, where Central American migrants are routinely targeted by traffickers and kidnappers. Habte Michael, 28, from Asmara, Eritrea, just arrived \u2013 three months after setting off from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. After a punishing journey he\u2019s exhausted, but optimistic he\u2019ll soon be in America where he will seek refuge.  Michael left Uganda for Rio Branco in northern Brazil in September 2015. He spent a few months learning Portuguese and planning his route, before crossing into Peru in May 2016. Next, he travelled overland on buses with the help of \u201cconnectors\u201d \u2013 an organised network of individuals who help migrants buy bus tickets and find cheap hotels \u2013 through Ecuador and Colombia. In Turbo on Colombia\u2019s west coast, he took a boat to Panama where he walked with Africans, Bangladeshis and Haitians for five exhausting days through acres of mountainous jungle with a coyote.     African and Haitian migrants cross the Suchiate river at the border between Guatemala and Mexico. Local rafters charge them eight times the normal rate. Photograph: Encarni Pindado for the Guardian    In June, after walking for three days, his group found the washed-up body of a west African man. \u201cThe river took him as he was walking in a group without a coyote, so he didn\u2019t know where it was safe to cross. In Panama we saw another dead man, also black, without head or hands.\u201d Entering Costa Rica is fine, but leaving ithas been much tougher since Nicaragua decided to close its border last year to stop the flow of Cubans migrating to the US. There are about 2,000 migrants from across the world currently trapped in dire conditions on the border with Nicaragua, at a camp in Pe\u00f1as Blancas. In August, 10 migrants \u2013 mostly Haitians \u2013 drowned crossing Lake Nicaragua. Michael was caught three times by Nicaraguan immigration agents and sent back to the camp. Like at least two dozen other migrants interviewed by the Guardian, he was robbed at gunpoint while walking through the Nicaraguan jungle. Desperate, he paid $1,000 to a truck driver to take him to Honduras, but the driver never showed up.  \u201cEach time a coyote takes your money or you get robbed, you must wait for family to send you something to carry on,\u201d Michael said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way \u2013 I can\u2019t go back.\u201d Michael eventually made it to Honduras \u2013 six weeks after arriving at the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border. Many migrants described Honduras as the easiest country to cross, as irregular migrants \u2013 those not from Central America \u2013 are given travel permits.    Each time a coyote take your money or you get robbed, you must wait from family to send you something to carry on  Habte Michael, migrant from Eritrea     In contrast, Panama and Nicaragua are the most dangerous.  Abdua Kareema, 38, from Ghana, was robbed by four gunmen in the jungle near Managua.  \u201cThey stripped the women and searched them intimately to see if they were hiding anything,\u201d Kareema said. \u201cOne woman had her time of the month, but the robber thought the feminine pad was something hidden, so he slapped her face.\u201d  Similar reports of sexual violence against women are common.  \u2018We just looked up a route on Google\u2019 By mid-morning, immigration officers have let through about 200 people who will spend a few days or weeks locked in, while their travel permits \u2013 which give them 21 days to leave Mexico \u2013 are processed. Most are economic migrants and will be given safe passage by Mexico. Meanwhile, busloads of detained Central Americans enter the gates; with most deported home the next day, to face the violence and threats they fled.  The rest, including Michael, are given dates to return later in the week. Disappointed, they sit around eating lychees and cheap biscuits, deciding what to do next.  But still, more people arrive. About 15 young men from the Punjab region of India arrive with their rucksacks, straight from the Guatemalan border which they had crossed by raft. Some flew from Delhi to Ecuador via Istanbul, others came via Indonesia and Dubai.      Indian migrants travelled for several months through Latin America before arriving at the immigration offices in Tapachula. Photograph: Encarni Pindado for the Guardian    \u201cWe didn\u2019t pay guides, we just looked up the route on Google,\u201d said Herdeep Ghotra, 26, a truck engineer. \u201cAlso my cousin came the same way two years before.\u201d Ghotra walked six days through the Panama jungle where he saw seven dead migrants \u2013 six men and one woman, all black. It\u2019s not clearly how or when they died, or if their bodies have since been recovered. Ghotra was also robbed at gunpoint in Nicaragua: \u201cThey took $200 and my love, my HTC phone.\u201d The Indians talk mostly about wanting to make a better a life for themselves. Some are trying to reunite with family members in the US, while Ghotra says a violent family conflict forced him to leave. An immigration officer emerges to tell them to come back in two days and prepare to be inside the center for a week. After that, they\u2019ll wait for money to be wired by relatives to fly to Tijuana where thousands of Africans, Asians and Haitians have descended this year.  No one here seems to be aware that US border control agents are now working here amid growing American concerns about security risks following recent terrorist attacks in the west. \u2018I welcome them with love\u2019 Tapachula\u2019s main square is jam-packed with people enjoying noisy fair rides and junk food stalls.  On an avenue just off the main square, lie the cheap hotels where most African and Asian migrants choose to stay; where a new curry house \u2013 run by a Mexican cook who was taught to make dhal and fish curry by a Bangladeshi migrant \u2013 is the most popular food joint. Just off the main drag is Mama Africa\u2019s \u2013 what everyone calls Concepci\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez, 56, who runs the $3a-night, no-frills Imperial Hotel. Here, there are people from across Africa: Burundi, South Africa, Nigeria, Somalia, Mozambique, Ghana, Congo and many Haitians pretending to be Congolese in order to avoid deportation.      Migrants gather in a hotel known as Mama Africa in downtown Tapachula, which is almost exclusively African. Photograph: Encarni Pindado for the Guardian    \u201cThey tell me how they want to make a better life for their families, I can understand and welcome them with love,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez told the Guardian.  There are 70 beds squeezed into 15 rooms, but tonight it\u2019s packed, so there are couples and mothers with infants resting on wafer-thin mattresses in the internal patio. Fedolina, 39, from Angola, has a ghostly look of pain and fatigue marked across her face. She fell while running from armed robbers in Nicaragua two weeks ago. Her right arm hangs limp, her shoulder looks dislocated, and there\u2019s a nasty gash on her forehead. She has yet to see a doctor.  Gonz\u00e1lez moves her into a quiet room and promises to take her to hospital in the morning.  As the plight of Syrians fleeing war continues to yield untold horrors in Europe, in this region, emerging crises also provoke new routes and new dangers.  Last year, Mama Africa was Mama Cuba as almost 10,000 Cubans entered Mexico amid rumours that the US visa waiver programme could end with the thawing of diplomatic ties. The numbers have plunged amid tighter travel restrictions in Latin America, but those determined to leave Cuba have found new routes.    I sold my few valuable things, my pigs, television and fan, to make this journey. But now what?  Onel Martin, migrant from Mexico     Pig farmers Ernesto P\u00e9rez, 46 and Onel Mart\u00edn, 44, left their hometown Manzanillo on the Caribbean coast last July on a handmade boat. Powered by a car engine, they sailed with 25 others, including nurses, a mechanic, and an economist. It took seven days and 1,000km to reach the Honduran Bay Island of Guanaja Bay, a risky but increasingly common route used by Cubans.  \u201cOur reason for leaving is purely economic, increased tourism has made no difference to our lives. I sold my few valuable things, my pigs, television and fan, to make this journey. But now what?\u201d said Martin, contemplating his next move outside the Bel\u00e9n migrant hostel.  After a temporary reprieve, immigration raids in Mexico are once again targeting Cubans.     Ernesto P\u00e9rez, left, and Onel Mart\u00edn sailed seven days on a handcrafted boat in Mexico.

Photograph: Encarni Pindado for the Guardian    In a surprise visit to Mexico earlier this week, Republican candidate Donald Trump reiterated his intent to build a wall along the US-Mexican border in order to end all migration from the Americas.  But wall or no wall, desperate people do desperate things.  In Tapachula airport Lejma, 21 and husband Ahmed, 22, from Mogadishu, Somalia, comfort their hysterical little girl, who thinks the immigration officers in white uniforms are doctors.  \u201cShe was very sick in the boats and got bitten by many mosquitoes when we walked seven days in the jungle,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cShe was then in hospital in Costa Rica for nearly one week and had many injections.\u201d Somaya, just 22 months, is covered in bite scars.  The family left Somalia to escape a police officer who was harassing Lejma, a waitress, demanding she be his wife. When she refused, the family was threatened by the officer\u2019s colleagues and clan.  Their plan is to fly to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and then claim asylum at the Brownsville border crossing in Texas. \u201cThere is no justice in my country, we had to leave,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cI hope we can work and one day bring our families to America.\u201d", "title": "Passage through Mexico: the global migration to the US", "sentences": ["Some flew from Delhi to Ecuador via Istanbul, others came via Indonesia and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-06T15:53:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/samia-shahid-father-alleged-hoped-to-use-blood-money-laws-to-get-away-with", "tags": ["Pakistan", "UK news", "Law", "Crime", "Bradford", "World news", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Family members accused of killing Samia Shahid, a British citizen who divorced and remarried without their permission, planned to use Pakistan\u2019s much-criticised \u201cblood money\u201d laws to forgive her killer, a report into the case has alleged. Police findings say the 28-year-old was the victim of \u201cpremeditated and cold-blooded honour killing\u201d, which her family had hoped to get away with by exploiting Islamic laws the government has repeatedly promised to scrap. A 43-page document says her father, Mohammad Shahid, asked for a postmortem examination to be carried out on his daughter two hours after helping her first husband, Mohammad Shakeel, strangle her to death in the family\u2019s ancestral village of Pandori, in the state of Punjab, on 20 July. Police say he wanted to rush the investigation, which was likely to conclude from bruising around Samia Shahid\u2019s neck that she had been murdered, so he could lodge a criminal case against Shakeel. \u201cIf Shakeel had been charged for murder \u2026 [Mohammad] Shahid could have easily pardoned him after a few days, being \u2018wali\u2019 [guardian] of the victim,\u201d the report said. Under Pakistan\u2019s 25-year-old blood money laws, the guardians of murder victims can forgive their killers in return for compensation, even though family members often conspire with each other to commit such crimes.  Rights campaigners say the effective impunity created by the laws has helped fuel the problem of so-called \u201chonour killings\u201d. There were more than 1,000 such killings reported to police last year, although the real number is thought to be far higher. The document was provided to the Guardian by Abubakar Khuda Bakhsh, appointed to lead a special investigation into the case for Punjab police after the Bradford MP Naz Shah appealed to Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. The report will be among documents due to be submitted on 17 September at the formal start of Mohammad Shahid\u2019s trial. Mohammad Arif, Shahid and Shakeel\u2019s lawyer, said his clients would plead not guilty.  The police report said the men could have successfully \u201chidden this gory crime in almost a perfect plot\u201d were it not for the arrival in Pakistan the next day of Samia Shahid\u2019s second husband, Mukhtar Syed Kazam, who immediately filed a criminal complaint against the family. Samia\u2019s father had attempted to conceal from police that his daughter had divorced Shakeel, a first cousin who had once been charged with attempted murder. The report said the family felt \u201cdishonoured\u201d by the divorce that she had organised in a Bradford sharia court in 2012 after a brief and unhappy marriage she claimed was never consummated. The divorce also angered Shakeel because it deprived him of the opportunity to immigrate to the UK and become a British citizen, the report said. Samia\u2019s decision to then marry a man from outside her extended family, who as a Shia did not follow the same Sunni school of Islam, had \u201cfurther tarnished the honour of the family\u201d. According to the report, Shakeel and Shahid hoped that once Samia was in Pakistan they could persuade her to abandon her second husband and return to Shakeel. Otherwise, Shahid was \u201cdetermined to go to any extent including taking [his] daughter\u2019s life\u201d, the report said. A local police officer has been arrested for allowing family members to leave the country. The report said Samia was sufficiently worried about her security not to tell her family when she was arriving and to arrange to be collected from the airport by a childhood friend, with whom she left her passport and return ticket as a safety measure. The report said they decided to kill her the day before she was due to return to Dubai, having failed to persuade her to stay in Pakistan.  Shakeel was said to have confronted Samia in an upstairs bedroom of his large house in Pandori and demanded to know where her passport and return ticket were. After she refused to tell him, he attacked and raped her, the report said. While trying to leave the house and threatening to alert the British government, she was confronted on the stairs by her father, it was claimed. Shakeel then strangled her with a scarf while her father held her legs, the report said. Arif told the Guardian: \u201cConfessions made before the police have no legal value here in Pakistan.\u201d Pakistan\u2019s government has won international plaudits by repeatedly promising to reform the blood money laws in a move that could trigger angry opposition from some hardline clerics. Sharif promised to take action in February after a Pakistani documentary about \u201chonour killings\u201d was nominated for an Oscar.  In July, Sharif\u2019s daughter, Maryam, said the law would be changed \u201cwithin weeks\u201d.  While a bill is ready to go before both houses of parliament, no legislative action has been taken. Sughra Imam, a former senator who has campaigned for years to change the laws, said there had been \u201cconsistent foot dragging\u201d on the issue. \u201cWe should strike while the iron is hot, but unfortunately the government seems to lack a sense of urgency,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is regrettable because meanwhile lives are being lost.\u201d", "title": "Samia Shahid's father allegedly hoped to use blood money laws to get away with murder", "sentences": ["The report said they decided to kill her the day before she was due to return to Dubai, having failed to persuade her to stay in Pakistan."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-06T16:50:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/icc-forced-to-shelve-plans-for-two-division-test-championship-india-cricket", "tags": ["International Cricket Council", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "The International Cricket Council has been forced to shelve plans for the creation of a two-division Test championship following opposition from Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and, most significantly, India. Dave Richardson, the ICC chief executive, had been behind a proposal that would have seen promotion and relegation between a seven-team top division and second tier of five \u2013 the latter including two new Test nations \u2013 that would have been played over a two-year period and possibly featured a Lord\u2019s final. Richardson had seen the league structure adding \u201cmeaning and context\u201d to bilateral cricket, while making Test status attainable for those countries currently faced with a glass ceiling through possible movement between the bottom division and the ICC\u2019s World Cricket League, its first-class competition for associate nations. While the boards of England, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Pakistan were all understood to have been in support of the plan, pressure from the Board of Control for Cricket in India has seen it withdrawn from the agenda during an ICC \u2018workshop\u2019 in Dubai this week that has been discussing future structures. The BCCI opposed the system due to a belief that it would have been detrimental to sides outside of the top division, with its president, Anurag Thakur, telling the Press Trust of India: \u201cWe want to grow the game and take it to new pastures and will not allow any step which can shrink the popularity and development of the game. \u201cI am thankful to the members of the ICC who understood our viewpoint and agreed to take this proposal off the table. As one of the key stakeholders in world cricket, BCCI would continue to have an inclusive approach and ensure that everyone\u2019s interest and the growth of cricket isn\u2019t compromised,\u201d In a watered-down compromise, the ICC members have agreed to consider the creation of a biennial Test Championship play-off between the two leading sides, however, while league structures for one-day internationals and Twenty20 internationals will also continue be discussed. Richardson, in a vague ICC statement that made no reference to the two division proposal, said: \u201cEncouragingly, there is an appetite from the 10 full members for more context around all three formats of the game and we have consensus on a range of areas. \u201cThis includes the details of ODI and T20 structures and principles around Test cricket schedules, which include the concept of a Test Champion play-off every two years, and the opportunity for more nations to be involved. \u201cThere are some complexities, not least because of scheduling and existing structures, but we envisage the changes being implemented for 2019. \u201cMembers will now revert to their boards to share the details of the proposed revised structures and principles.

Instead, and at an age when many young men are still wondering what to do with their lives, O\u2019Brien emerged from retirement here on Wednesday to record what will probably be the final winner of a brief but hugely successful career in the saddle. O\u2019Brien\u2019s pedigree gave him the chance to ride some of the most impeccably bred bloodstock in the business, but he was already tall and still growing during his time as the main jockey at Ballydoyle for his father, Aidan. Two Derby victories, on Camelot (2012) and Australia (2014), were among the highlights in a record that included almost three dozen wins at Group or Grade One level, while his association with St Nicholas Abbey yielded wins in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf at Churchill Downs and the Dubai Sheema Classic at Meydan. O\u2019Brien\u2019s ride on Phosphorescence in the annual Leger Legends race in aid of racing charities was his first in 2016. His breathlessness afterwards made it plain that it is also likely to be his last. O\u2019Brien had just executed a perfectly judged front-running success on the 7-1 chance, who was racing for the first time since July 2015, but he conceded that his legs were like jelly and that \u201cif I can get back to the weighing room after that, I\u2019ve done well\u201d. O\u2019Brien won four British Classics in his short career, two more than Richard Hughes, the champion jockey in 2012, 2013 and 2014, who retired last summer at the age of 42 after nearly three decades in the saddle. O\u2019Brien was granted a trainer\u2019s licence in early June and now oversees a mixed string of around 70 horses at Owning Hill in County Kilkenny, the family-owned stable his parents left in 1995 to move to Ballydoyle. He ruled becoming a regular in the race in years to come, saying: \u201cI\u2019m blowing quite a bit. I don\u2019t ride out too much at home now because we have a big string of horses and you can\u2019t ride out with them and see everything. \u201cIt\u2019s great craic and it\u2019s nice that he won, but it\u2019s all about supporting a good cause and not taking it too seriously.

He leads a nomadic existence, moving from room to anonymous room around the city every night, renting out his own properties on Airbnb and communicating with his guests remotely through a series of invented aliases. \u201cI sell dreams,\u201d he says, in a short film by Ila B\u00eaka and Louise Lemoine that is showing as part of the 2016 Oslo architecture triennale, After Belonging. \u201cShort, customised dreams.\u201d He and his former wife first experimented as Airbnb hosts a few years ago when they went away for the weekend. They returned to find their clothes left in unusual places around the apartment and, after a bit of Instagram snooping, discovered their guests had been rifling through their wardrobe and acting out their lives in a kind of domestic cosplay. Rather than stop hosting, Mark decided to invest in some spy cameras, which he dotted around the house to keep an eye on future guests. That\u2019s when things got weird. \u201cBefore we knew it, we were spending every Saturday night in a hotel room, watching the livestream of our own home,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were watching people wearing our clothes, reading our books, having sex in our bed.\u201d Perhaps understandably, his wife thought this was all rather strange and left him. \u201cShe wanted kids, a dog, a car: the Danish idea of true happiness,\u201d says Mark who, undeterred, has expanded his Airbnb empire into a full-time business. His catalogue of apartments belong to a cast of fictional hosts, from a gay couple, to a lonely artist, to a perfect Danish nuclear family \u2013 the most popular of the bunch.     \u2018I became free\u2019 ...

Family photos, downloaded from the internet, dot the mantelpiece, completing the elaborate fairytale. By supplying stage sets for the fantasies of others, Mark has liberated himself from his own. \u201cI don\u2019t need belongings any more. I feel I\u2019ve managed to disconnect.

Curated by five Spanish architects and academics, based between New York and Rotterdam, who are all connected to Columbia University\u2019s notoriously theory-heavy GSAPP architecture school, the scope of their project is mind-bogglingly vast.      From the installation Movement as Civil Disobedience, focusing on the Greek island Lesbos. Photograph: Istvan Virag    Through a pair of exhibitions (On Residence and In Residence), a conference and an events programme running until the end of November, they seek to interrogate everything from the spatial politics of national borders to the destabilising effects of the gig economy and the \u201cpornification\u201d of the home. The contents list reads like a litany of PhD proposals \u2013 and many of the exhibited results feel just as dense. There are a lot of abstract installations, projections and sound pieces to baffle and bemuse. \u201cMovement as Civil Disobedience: Mapping Migration and Solidarity on Lesvos Island\u201d looks at networks of human rights activists on the Greek island through which 450,000 Syrian refugees have passed since 2015. The result is a series of acrylic panels etched with maps and diagrams and hung in front of each other so as to be rendered illegible. Another project focuses on the furniture exchange platform finn.no (the Norwegian Craigslist). It claims to \u201cinterrogate the relation between the lack of economic exchange value of these objects and the accumulation and construction of historical or affective value\u201d. The exhibit is a load of coffee tables and chairs hung in a big pile. There\u2019s more meat to be found in a short film by Spanish architect Andr\u00e9s Jaque, who has woven a series of seemingly unrelated strands into a thought-provoking tale on identity and exoticism. He begins with the Victoria amazonica, a species of flowering water lily native to Brazil, for which Joseph Paxton built a dedicated hothouse at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, recreating the plant\u2019s humid habitat and its first momentous flowering in 1849. We then jump to sleepyboy.com, the UK\u2019s number-one male escort directory, on which \u201cBrazilian\u201d is the most searched term.

There are hundreds of such spaces across the city, we discover, creating what the narrator terms a \u201csecluded and sexualised backyard architecture of otherness\u201d \u2013 the contemporary equivalent, in Jaque\u2019s logic, of Paxton\u2019s hothouses: artificial capsules for exotic species displaced and re-socialised for the purpose of pleasure.

Most of this is in On Residence, at the Norwegian Centre for Design and Architecture (Doga). Across town, the National Museum of Architecture hosts In Residence, a show of such tenuous ambition and muddled curation as to be rendered almost entirely meaningless. Once again, the subjects are promising: the negotiation of resources in Kirkenes, a town on the Norwegian border with Russia; an asylum seekers\u2019 reception centre in Oslo; self-storage facilities in New York City; and the healthcare tourism industry in Dubai.

If you want to get a feel for the tone of whole thing, look no further than the Landscape Urbanism Bullshit Generator. The curators say that the \u201cAfter\u201d in After Belonging refers to a search, a pursuit, a quest for belonging. But they must also decide where they themselves want to belong: choose to engage with the real world, or retreat to the realms of arcane theorising? They have identified a fascinating field of investigation, and clearly had no shortage of ambition. Sadly, too many of the projects take compelling topics and murder them with a toxic cocktail of wilful complexity, pseudointellectual posturing and dumb conceptual art. \u2022 Oslo Architecture Biennale: After Belonging runs until 27 November.", "title": "Oslo architecture triennale: Airbnb cosplay for the gig economy nomad", "sentences": ["Once again, the subjects are promising: the negotiation of resources in Kirkenes, a town on the Norwegian border with Russia; an asylum seekers\u2019 reception centre in Oslo; self-storage facilities in New York City; and the healthcare tourism industry in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-12T16:47:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/indonesia-permission-philippines-execute-drug-mule-rodrigo-duterte-mary-jane-veloso", "tags": ["Philippines", "Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Capital punishment"], "article": "Indonesia has said the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has given his blessing for the execution of a Filipino death row inmate, Mary Jane Veloso.

Migrante International, a group that promotes the rights of overseas Filipino workers, said it and the Veloso family were in shock over the news from Jakarta.

Jokowi delayed Veloso\u2019s execution date in April 2015 with a temporary reprieve hours before she was due to be killed.  Her reprieve came after Maria Kristina Sergio, a woman accused of recruiting Veloso, handed herself in to police in Manila. The former Philippine president, Benigno Aquino, made an appeal to Jokowi on the basis that Veloso would be needed as a witness in the case against Sergio. Indonesia shot dead eight people in April 2015, including two Australians, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who had fought a years-long campaign for clemency and were part of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring. Four Nigerians, a Brazilian and an Indonesian were also killed. Veloso has also won sympathy in Indonesia, which, like the Philippines, has a large foreign worker diaspora.

The idea of racing them has been embedded in pop culture for ages, but it\u2019s only recently that the sport has started to form itself into something recognisably professional. Landmarks have come thick and fast in the past year, most notably with the $1m (\u00a3760,000) Dubai World Drone Prix in March. Now, the fledgling sport is about to reach Britain. Sky has decided to invest $1m into a US drone-racing formula, run by a former Tough Mudder executive; 10 episodes of the Drone Racing League will be shown on Sky Sports Mix. The deal also paves the way for a British drone race, at a venue yet to be decided.

Unlike the Predators that launch missiles in western Pakistan and can hover for 24 hours at a time, the drones here are quadcopters: with four rotor blades surrounding a central chassis, they can move at up to 90mph. Racing formulas differ, but the pilots all use cameras embedded in their drones to get a first-person view while operating. The tracks are three-dimensional, left-right, up-down affairs.

Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg/Getty Images    With drone racing being such a new sport, a land-grab is under way. So far, the winners are the Sky-partnered Drone Racing League, the National Drone Racing Championships (which held a flagship event on Governors Island, New York, at the start of August) and the Dubai World Drone Prix (which, in addition to the groundbreaking prize money, offered 32 teams an all-expenses-paid trip to the UAE). The Dubai track is a futuristic assemblage of specially made polymer obstacles that resembles the vertebrae of an 800-metre-long plastic lizard. Competitors must execute tight manoeuvres to pass through different checkpoints. The Drone Racing League prefers a more grungy, urbex \u2013 urban exploration \u2013 feel. Its first race was in February, at the Miami Dolphins\u2019 Hard Rock stadium; the next was at the abandoned Hawthorne mall in Los Angeles. Neon checkpoints and LED-lit quadcopters add to the air of a speakeasy located somewhere in the orbit of Tatooine. The National Drone Racing Championships, on the other hand, with its grassland setting and slalom-style gates, looks like a gymkhana for BB8. Visually, the experience is all about immersion \u2013 seeing things from a pilot\u2019s eye view and experiencing an unsettling, dreamlike feeling of flying. The Drone Racing League has had to develop proprietary radio signal relay systems in order to broadcast video streams in areas such as tunnels where traditional rigs wouldn\u2019t penetrate. The National Drone Racing Championships became the first to launch a mainstream TV deal when ESPN picked up the rights for its August event.

At the moment, drone racers are mainly men who sit in a control booth, obscured behind their first-person-view goggles. Perhaps acknowledging this, the Drone Racing League has decided they must have self-consciously \u201cfunky\u201d names that make them sound like rejects from a casting call for a new Black Eyed Peas lineup. Among the most notable are FlyingBear, a mechanical product design engineer known for his tendency to stand up while racing; Spaztik (yes, Spaztik); the reckless Hazak; calculating Australian rekreK; and Zoomas, a former dirtbike racer who works in construction management. The naming silliness continues at the National Drone Racing Championships, where there\u2019s top-ranked Charpu, Nytfury, UmmaGawd and CodeRed. Almost all drone racers remain hobbyists, but the sport is seized by the sense that it\u2019s inventing the future. Right now, they claim, we\u2019re still in the era of Juan Manuel Fangio getting out of the car to swig champagne during a Monza pit stop. Soon enough, they argue, Bernie Ecclestone-style big bucks are inevitable. The list of investors is certainly impressive. Among those who have put money into the Drone Racing League are startup godhead Gary Vaynerchuk and Muse\u2019s lead singer Matt Bellamy.

The revelation comes in the first report released by the Sentry, an investigative organisation founded by the US actor George Clooney and the rights activist John Prendergast to track and analyse how armed conflict and atrocities are financed. The report accuses senior officials on modest salaries in South Sudan of profiteering from the civil war.   Related: George Clooney-backed report: South Sudan president profits from civil war    In the foreword to their report, Clooney and Prendergast write that top officials in South Sudan have \u201cmanaged to accumulate fortunes, despite modest government salaries\u201d while the country is divided by a civil war.  \u201cMeanwhile, some top officials and their family members own stakes in a broad array of companies doing business in the country \u2013 and, in some cases, these commercial engagements may be in violation of South Sudanese law.  \u201cMembers of their families often live in multimillion-dollar mansions outside the country, stay in five-star hotels, reap the benefits of what appears to be a system of nepotism and shady corporate deals, and drive around in luxury cars \u2013 all while much of their country\u2019s population suffers from the consequences of a brutal civil war and, in many places, experiences near-famine conditions.\u201d The report highlights General James Hoth Mai Nguoth and his family as a case study, saying he bought a home in the Melbourne suburb of Narre Warren North under his son\u2019s name in 2014. Hoth Mai served as the chief of staff and deputy chief of logistics of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army before being dismissed in 2014. \u201cThe residence is situated on a one-acre lot backing up to a forested area bordering nearby Lysterfield Lake, a popular destination for sailing, canoeing and mountain biking,\u201d the Sentry report says.  \u201cThe home boasts four bedrooms, a top-of-the-line kitchen, a two-tiered home theatre, a sauna and an infinity pool. When the Sentry visited the home in August 2016, a BMW 316 used by one of Hoth Mai\u2019s daughters was parked in front of the house.  \u201cThe home was described by the real estate agency that sold it as \u2018perfecting the balance between serenity and glamour\u2019.  The agent who sold Hoth Mai the home, and who did not want to be named, told Guardian Australia that he thought the family \u201cwere lovely and very well-mannered and well-educated\u201d. Contrary to the Sentry report\u2019s claims, he said the property was originally bought in Hoth Mai\u2019s wife\u2019s name, not his son\u2019s. The name was transferred to his son at settlement. The agent said he did show Hoth Mai through the home once and that the property had been paid for using money transferred from overseas bank accounts, including from Dubai.  According to a report in the Australian, the former owner of the home grew suspicious of the Hoth Mai family owing to difficulties with the settlement, including the family experiencing trouble getting money out of Dubai. He reported his concerns to the Foreign Investment Review Board but told the Australian the board \u201cdidn\u2019t want a bar of it\u201d. The Guardian has sought comment from Hoth Mai. In July Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, announced $8m in funding for the South Sudan humanitarian fund and the UN high commissioner for refugees to deliver deliver food, shelter, security and other assistance to South Sudanese who had fled the conflict to neighbouring countries. It brought Australia\u2019s total contribution to South Sudan to more than $50m since December 2013.  The Sentry report also states that the president, Salva Kiir, and the opposition leader, Riek Machar, had both amassed wealth from the conflict, which they had shared with their family through luxury trips, cars and homes. \u201cSeveral of President Kiir\u2019s other children have attended high school and college in Australia, Malaysia and Uganda,\u201d the report said.  \u201cAnd President Kiir\u2019s children appear to travel internationally for more than just their education.

Previously outside the select group of horses rated 120 or above, Almanzor has advanced to a mark of 127, 6lb behind California Chrome, the 2014 Kentucky Derby winner, who takes over from Japan\u2019s A Shin Hikari, a wide-margin winner of the Group One Prix D\u2019Ispahan, as the top-rated horse in the world. Art Sherman\u2019s five-year-old, who won the Dubai World Cup in March, moved up from a mark of 128 after his five-length success in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in August. A Shin Hikari, who has not raced since finishing last when favourite for the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, is joint-second on the list on a mark of 129, alongside Arrogate, who took the Travers Stakes at Saratoga by nearly 14 lengths, breaking a 37-year-old track record in the process. Arrogate is expected to line up against California Chrome in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic at Santa Anita in early November. Postponed, the 7-2 ante-post favourite for the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, is the top-rated British-trained horse in the latest rankings with a mark of 124. It seems increasingly likely that he will also be the top-rated horse in the field for the Arc, with Almanzor being steered instead towards the Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot 13 days later. Almanzor is still quoted for the Arc by most bookmakers at a top price of 7-1, but La Cressonniere, a stable companion of Almanzor at Jean-Claude Rouget\u2019s yard, is now ahead of him in the list on 6-1. Almanzor is the clear favourite for the Champion Stakes, however, at best odds of 3-1.", "title": "Secret Number ready for Australian targets after staying on to win at Ayr", "sentences": ["Art Sherman\u2019s five-year-old, who won the Dubai World Cup in March, moved up from a mark of 128 after his five-length success in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in August."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-15T18:31:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/16/hustle-bustle-soothing-stories-making-new-city-home", "tags": ["Cities", "Life and style", "Travel", "Moving overseas", "Migration", "World news"], "article": "London, UK \u201cIt took a while until I actually felt at home here. But everything that had unsettled me about London in the beginning \u2013 the hectic pace, the constant noise, the onslaught of people \u2013 became an essential part of my daily routine, one that gave me comfort.\u201d (Anonymous, moved from Berlin to London in 2013) \u201cArriving in London was like putting on the best pair of shoes you\u2019ve ever worn. I realised London was my home the day I arrived 32 years ago; it still is. I came to study ballet, and to arrive and swim in such culture-rich waters was a homecoming. Irish by nationality, European by inclination, Londoner by choice ... 32 years and counting.\u201d (Connor Byrne, moved from Limerick to London in 1984) \u201cThere have been several moments that made me realise London is my home.

Also, when you see the same people on the subway every morning, leaving their flats at the same time and getting off at their respective stops. The community feeling comes alive once you have familiar faces during the commute.\u201d (Olivia Graham, moved from Boston to New York in 2014)  \u201cNew York is the antithesis of the pristine natural beauty and calm in Seattle, where I had a yard. I found it impossible to ignore the roar of the adjacent six-lane highway in my new home. About a year in, I began walking a lot. I realised every walk in New York is an epic saga for people-watching alone, but on top of that, it got me involved in eclectic local communities.\u201d (Helen Brew, moved from Seattle to New York)     Lima: \u2018I found it huge, noisy, congested\u2019. Photograph: zxvisual/Getty Images    Lima, Peru \u201cIt was my first time ever living in a big capital city. I found it huge, noisy, congested and I was exhausted and with the feeling of being constantly on guard. I was also amazed by the cultural diversity. I felt at home when I fell asleep on the public transport, when I realised I was able to cross the entire city changing from one bus to another a hundred times and when I was no longer afraid of going out at night and coming back home on my own. Also, when the taxi driver thought I was \u2018lime\u00f1a\u2019 after singing the full lyrics of one salsa song played on the radio. (Patricia, moved from Barcelona to Lima in 2004) Berlin, Germany \u201cFinding an apartment in Berlin is not easy when you are effectively unemployed, barely speak the language and have not yet amassed all the necessary paperwork. After about nine months of bouncing from sublet to sublet, we found a home of our own. Arriving to collect our keys and seeing our names on the doorbell felt like a massive milestone, even though it was only a tiny one-room apartment.\u201d (Kate, moved from Melbourne to Berlin in 2011)   Related: How I found 'my Toronto thing': when does a city become home?

I can order food at 2am delivered right to my door. In Indonesia, that\u2019s awesome. What made it familiar to me was when I realised that Jakarta is the most progressive and open-minded city in Indonesia. I feel safe knowing that.\u201d (Irawan, moved from Malang to Jakarta in 2011)  Ljubljana, Slovenia \u201cI tried to make Ljubljana mine by making mental perky to-do lists \u2013 walks that would last several hours through the lesser-known parts of the capital, comparing and then bitching about the prices of coffee in the most popular cafes, remembering fun facts about the names of all of the streets that meant something to me (the street where my faculty is located, for instance, is named after an 19th century Slovenian priest who couldn\u2019t resist writing mildly sensual poetry, because he was just too curious). And now, after three years, I can safely say that I have become something else, something more than a tourist and less than an immigrant.\u201d (Marija Jeremi\u0107, moved from U\u017eice to Ljubljana in 2013)      Amsterdam: \u2018Everyone bikes here.\u2019 Photograph: Karen Desjardin/Moment Editorial/Getty Images    Amsterdam, the Netherlands \u201cAmsterdam was so different than the busy, bustling, dirty and unpredictable Athens. Everything was clean, manicured, ordered. It was very alienating at first. I also found it a bit boring. The moment I realised I was home was when I was biking to work \u2013 everyone bikes here \u2013 and I came across some tourists on rented bikes going the wrong way on the bike path. Instead of smiling permissively (which is what my Athenian self would have done), I shot them the \u2018Dutch Blaming Look\u2019: a look of derision and disdain, preserved for everyone who breaks any rule. I myself had been the recipient of that stare many times, and my friends and I had given it its name. The moment I gave that look, I knew that I had become a bona fide Amsterdammer.\u201d (Tania Theodorou, moved from Athens to Amsterdam in 2002)  Manchester, UK \u201cWhen I started riding a bike to work it transformed the way I viewed the city \u2013 everything felt easier to get to, and I felt much calmer. I started really noticing my surroundings for the first time, and appreciating things like the change of seasons. My itchy feet gradually went away, and I finally began to really enjoy living in Manchester.\u201d (Joe Paxton, moved to Manchester in 2007) Katowice, Poland \u201cEvery day I would walk for hours in the city, getting to know street patterns, nice cafes, local groceries etc. There was this \u2018map Katowice\u2019 project I helped with (the result of which, a map of all buildings in the city colour-coded by age, is stunning), and then I started going to the museum for lectures about local architecture. And if someone would criticise the city, I would defend it.\u201d (Szymon, moved to Katowice in 2012) Austin, US \u201cI feel more like an Austinite as I have come to terms with nature over the years,. Hearing coyotes howl in the middle of the night (and losing one of our cats to them); our son discovering a scorpion hiding under a pail and being stung; myself needing surgery from a brown recluse spider bite; and pulling a 10-inch long centipede out of a window box planter are some of the highlights. Now we live in Austin\u2019s ever-expanding downtown where the wildlife is more of the alcohol-infused variety, but it still feels like a small town and very much like home.\u201d (Melanie, moved to Austin in 1997)      Melbourne: \u2018The parks made me feel at home.\u2019 Photograph: Chad Ehlers/Getty Images    Melbourne, Australia \u201cIt was cold, it was confusing, it was foreign. But soon I realised Melbourne has a lot of things that Jakarta doesn\u2019t have. The first thing you notice is proper public transport. Despite the fact that I\u2019ve encountered quite a few locals who complain about the tram being slow, I don\u2019t care. To me, it\u2019s an upgrade from Jakarta\u2019s transport system. The second thing that makes me feel at home are the parks. There aren\u2019t that many open public spaces in Jakarta that are comfortable and relatively non-threatening.\u201d (Anonymous, moved from Jakarta to Melbourne in 2016) Abu Dhabi, UAE \u201cWhen we first arrived in Abu Dhabi, we greeted our new city somewhat treading precariously. But we soon realised that there can indeed be many homes for those living the expatriate life. Being Indians in the Middle East means you can feel relaxed knowing that India is a short flight away and the city is inhabited by others hailing from the Asian subcontinent.  What really clinched it for me was the taxi drivers and their warmth. A Pakistani taxi driver who goes out of his way to make an Indian passenger feel welcome and comfortable in today\u2019s world when the two countries are embroiled in political turmoil speaks volumes of people and their need for camaraderie that can make them forget all else.    Home is instinctively waking up from a nap seconds before it\u2019s time to step out at my intended metro stop  Sarah McMahon-Sperber     These taxi drivers in Abu Dhabi certainly fuelled a feeling of comfort in me and reinstated that belief that echoes in many of us: that home is where the heart is, and where you find good people to share it with.\u201d (Anonymous, moved from Munich to Abu Dhabi in 2015)  Oslo, Norway \u201cOslo felt like a quiet, small village in comparison to the hustle and bustle of London. I took the ferry from Harwich to Gothenburg and drove to Oslo, my first long solo drive.

Just like any love affair, our beginnings were ravenous. I wanted to know Montreal intimately. I went looking for her in the city\u2019s restaurants, bars, parks and festivals; and I found hints of her in these iconic and tangible spaces. But my real sense of understanding came when I started intuitively navigating the city\u2019s metro system. All of a sudden, something clicked. I started carving paths for myself across the whole city. I knew where to wait for the doors to open in a busy crowd, knew which end of the platform to embark on depending on my final station, knew which of six confusing exits would take me exactly where I needed to go. I like to think I literally know parts of Montreal inside and out. These days, I\u2019ve been making a point of stopping to read all of the plaques around the metro network. Turns out, there are tons of them sprinkled across the city, and they tell rich and insightful stories. They help me add context and intricacy to my city\u2019s narrative.

Condemned to death on drug-smuggling charges, she was temporarily reprieved hours before her execution, but still languishes on death row in an Indonesian prison. And last week the skies darkened again over Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipino maid whose plight has captured the imagination of two populations that know all about the vulnerability of migrant workers. After the Philippines\u2019 president, the newly installed Rodrigo Duterte, visited Jakarta, it was reported that he had given his Indonesian counterpart, Joko Widodo, the go-ahead to execute her. Duterte has begun a ferocious and bloody war on drugs in the Philippines. That change of political direction has, it seems, led to yet another twist in the tortured tale of a woman who lost control of her life from the moment she entered Indonesia in 2010, hoping, she has said, to take up a job in domestic service. Amid public outrage in the Philippines, Widodo subsequently clarified that Duterte had said: \u201cPlease, go ahead with the process in line with the law in Indonesia,\u201d without naming Veloso. Few of her supporters were reassured. \u201cWe demand an immediate explanation from President Duterte \u2026 duty-bound to defend the rights of Filipinos overseas, especially drug-trafficking victims like Mary Jane,\u201d said Migrante International, a group that campaigns for the Veloso family.     Cesar and Celia Veloso, Mary Jane\u2019s parents, at a rally in Manila before President Duterte\u2019s visit to Indonesia. Photograph: Romeo Ranoco / Reuters/Reuters    Born to an impoverished family in the northern city of Cabanatuan, Veloso married at 17 but later separated from her husband. She moved to the United Arab Emirates in 2009 to earn money for her two young sons in the Philippines. Veloso says that she had to flee Dubai after an attempted rape and was then duped into smuggling drugs into Indonesia. Her case has become the focus of sympathy in both the Philippines and Indonesia, where many families have loved ones working abroad, often in poor conditions with abusive employers. Before the original date set for her execution last April, more than 200,000 signatures from 127 countries were collected for a #SaveMaryJane petition. Veloso says that a woman called Maria Kristina Sergio, the daughter of one of her godparents, told her to move to Indonesia for a maid\u2019s job in 2010. In an account that Sergio disputes, Veloso says the woman gave her new clothes and a bag that she says she was unaware had 2.6kg (5.7lb) of heroin sewn into it. \u201cWe\u2019re poor and I wanted to change our life, but I could never commit the crime they have accused me of,\u201d Veloso wrote last year in a letter to the then president, Benigno Aquino. Her legal team launched two appeals in Indonesia, one that argued she did not have a competent translator, and a second saying she was scammed. Both were rejected. As her April 2015 execution date approached, protesters in the Philippines and Indonesia rallied to save her and hundreds of people held vigils outside the Indonesian embassy in Manila. Even world boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao made a public plea for her life. Two days before Veloso\u2019s execution date, her family was allowed a visit. She explained to her sons that she would not be coming home. Her youngest child, six-year-old Mark Darren, said he would try to think that \u201cMama is in heaven\u201d. Then Indonesia shot dead eight people, including two Australians, part of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring, four Nigerians, a Brazilian and an Indonesian. But not Veloso, although several newspapers in the Philippines reported she was dead. The hashtag \u201cmaryjanelives\u201d trended on Twitter across the Philippines and Indonesia. The reprieve was down to an unexpected turn of events in her homeland. Veloso\u2019s alleged trafficker, Sergio, had handed herself in to police hours before the execution. And Aquino, invoking a regional treaty that compels nations to co-operate on transnational crime, asked Indonesia to keep Veloso alive. He said she was needed to testify in the case against Sergio and another man, now accused of trafficking, illegal recruitment and fraud. Indonesia\u2019s president insisted that the execution was merely postponed, but the campaign for clemency had new grounds for hope. A year on, the accession of Duterte to the presidency has again changed the dynamics of Veloso\u2019s case. Duterte\u2019s first three months in office have been dominated by a bloody crackdown that has left 3,526 alleged drug dealers and addicts dead, most of them in extrajudicial killings by vigilante groups, actions that were publicly encouraged by Duterte before he was elected. Senator Leila de Lima, who has been leading a senate hearing into the killings and is one of the main domestic critics of Duterte, said that she was \u201csad and heartbroken that the president will throw away all our efforts to save a life just like that, when it is still in his power to request the holding off of the execution\u201d. But it was no surprise, she added, that Veloso\u2019s life might seem of no worth to an administration that had adopted judicial or extrajudicial executions as \u201cgovernment policy\u201d. Even Duterte has said that fighting for Veloso\u2019s life would sit badly with his drugs crackdown. \u201cIt would have left a bad taste in the mouth to be talking about having a strong posture against drugs and here you are begging for something,\u201d he told reporters, adding that he told Widodo he supported the death penalty in Indonesia. Capital punishment was outlawed in the Philippines in 2006. Veloso\u2019s legal team told the Observer it was very concerned. \u201cMary Jane is a victim of dire poverty, of lack of real opportunities for a decent job, of pernicious drug and human trafficking. The law may be the law, but it should not be blind or deaf to reality,\u201d lawyer Edre Olalia wrote in an email. \u201cAs the leader of this nation and as the pater familias of all Filipinos, President Duterte is expected to rise to his bounden duty and fight for her, and fight hard as he does for all victims of this transnational infection.\u201d Widodo\u2019s reported conversation with Duterte has reinvigorated public interest in Veloso\u2019s case and the office of Indonesia\u2019s attorney general said last week that she would not be killed in the next wave of executions. The judge in the case involving Sergio said that she would fly to Indonesia this month to get a deposition from Veloso in her prison cell. Veloso\u2019s supporters believe that a trial can vindicate her, if it can prove she was used as a pawn. \u201cWinning the case will codify Mary Jane\u2019s innocence and erase all doubts that she should be spared from execution,\u201d said Garry Martinez, chair of Migrante International. Ruperto Santos, a prominent Roman Catholic bishop in the Philippines, said that \u201cconflicting reports regarding the actions of President Duterte\u201d on the Veloso case were regrettable. \u201cLet us continue to pray for her, that her life be spared.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2016 to clarify that people killed in the crackdown are alleged, not necessarily proven, to be drug dealers and drug addicts.

According to government sources, Giles called a meeting in late 2014 after Rinehart personally made a \u201cdiscreet offer\u201d. Giles immediately directed his then health minister, Robyn Lambley, the head of the health department, Len Notaras, and a senior bureaucrat, Anne Tan, to visit a particular facility in Turkey and determine how it could be replicated in Darwin. The Istanbul site was a nondescript shopfront disguising world-leading medical equipment, services and specialists. The short trip, which also took in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was shrouded in secrecy, with the group not knowing the location of the Istanbul facility until they arrived and called around external sources. The facility, which Lambley said catered to high-end and VIP clients, including royalty, was understood to have impressed the group but Lambley told Guardian Australia she didn\u2019t think it was viable and the chief minister was informed as much on their return.   Related: Sophie Mirabella appointed to senior role at Gina Rinehart's company    \u201cThe medical tourism industry is extremely competitive throughout the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were told people would only go to a facility if the medical specialists were first class internationally and people would only pay to go to a particular destination that had the appeal of not just medical services but other appeals as well.\u201d Lambley said one Australian specialist at the hospital said in his opinion the only place such a facility would be successful in Australia was at the Gold Coast. \u201cIn hindsight it was a complete waste of time and money in my opinion,\u201d Lambley said. \u201cWithin weeks of coming back Giles reshuffled the whole of cabinet.\u201d She said the competitive market and the need to attract the best specialists, coupled with Darwin\u2019s low global recognition and the high cost of labour for a facility that catered \u201caround the clock\u201d to its high-end patients, made it an unrealistic venture. Few details of the Rinehart deal were made available to the delegates and there remains confusion about exactly what it entailed, including whether the \u201cfor-profit charity\u201d would cater to local Northern Territory patients without private insurance, Guardian Australia was told. In February 2015 Rinehart first indicated the project was already funded. Accepting an award in Kuala Lumpur last year, Rinehart said her company had paid back loans for three mining operations and \u201cwere able to fund our commitment for the largest charitable donation in Australian history \u2013 to build a private specialised cancer and keyhole hospital for primarily the people of Northern Australia\u201d. She said the hope was it would be based on the Darwin coastline \u201cso that patients, and medical staff, can also enjoy water views, while recuperating and working\u201d. \u201cIt was very vague \u2013 I never saw anything in writing,\u201d Lambley told Guardian Australia.  \u201cThere was no agreement between Gina Rinehart and the government that was in writing. My understanding was it was a discussion between Mrs Rinehart and the chief minister and we were dispatched to go on this reconnaissance mission to collect information based on that conversation \u2026 There was no documentation, there was no plan.\u201d The new Northern Territory government has been contacted for comment but the chief minister, Michael Gunner, on Sunday said he would look at the project to see if it suited Territorians.", "title": "Gina Rinehart's office says offer to build Darwin cancer hospital hasn't been scrapped", "sentences": ["The short trip, which also took in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was shrouded in secrecy, with the group not knowing the location of the Istanbul facility until they arrived and called around external sources."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-19T04:14:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/19/bank-that-puts-its-money-on-developing-local-branches", "tags": ["Money", "Banks and building societies", "Nationwide", "Small business", "Business"], "article": "In his gloomy assessment of the future of bank branches, Patrick Collinson holds up as a benchmark for determining the number of branches a bank needs the criteria outlined by Nationwide director Graeme Hughes, which involves concentrating on areas of highest population density, meaning that \u201ctowns with a population much below 10,000 \u2026 are not really worth having a branch in\u201d (Why 3,000 bank branches must close, On reflection, Money, 17 September). Surprisingly, Collinson fails to mention the banks that are opening branches. For instance, Sweden\u2019s Handelsbanken has more than doubled its presence in the UK in four years and marked the opening of its 200th branch in the UK a year ago. In 2001, it had only six branches in Britain. Its philosophy, unlike that of Graeme Hughes, is to intensify decentralisation in order to get closer to its customers and develop a customer base in each branch\u2019s community. To facilitate this, each branch is run autonomously.David HeadNavenby, Lincolnshire \u2022 Patrick Collinson observes that he has not visited his local bank this year, and that some branches see just a handful of people a day. Could the reason be that UK\u2019s banks no longer offer the local expertise that used to pull people in? There was a time when managing a branch meant keeping tabs on local small businesses and using their experience to grant (or decline) requests for overdrafts and loans. But for today\u2019s giant banks it is much easier to have HQ assess a \u00a310m loan to a developer in Dubai than it is to maintain an informed local network capable of making 100 loans of \u00a3100,000 in the UK. Society grants our banks the huge privilege of creating demand deposits, ie money, by issuing overdrafts and loans.

All the more so because it reflects a similar hardening of attitudes towards refugees evident here in Australia. On a recent flight from Dubai to Adelaide my wife Julie and I encountered Syrian refugees bound for re-settlement in South Australia. They were in a state of anxious anticipation at the prospect of new life down under. But, much more than this, they were relieved to be escaping the holocaust in their homeland. I hope that promise of a new life is fulfilled. The odds are very much with them that it will. But it won\u2019t be completely plain sailing for them here in terms of acceptance by any means. They are starting out on a new life in a nervous society where buses for the first time ask passengers to be wary of unattended luggage, where government warnings encourage us to report anything that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look right\u201d, where an innocent question from a Syrian refugee to a policeman can be enough for that refugee to have his details written down as a routine security precaution, where our cyberspace is full of the most puerile anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant nonsense, where far rightists on immigration have just had marked success in our recent national election, and where a barbaric refugee policy still has strong public support.

At present it could go either way.Terry HewtonAdelaide, South Australia \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de comments on the future of Europe (9 September), with her opinion that behind all evil in the world is Russia. I totally agree that \u201cthe so-called Franco-German engine ... is broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses\u201d. Germany, for all its talk of upholding the rules, breaks year after year the rules on trade surpluses. It is projected to reach this year alone up to 8.9% of GDP. Anything above 6% is in violation of EU rules. Where are the politicians and journalists to shine the brightest light on this destruction of other nations\u2019 economies? Is it a wonder that the French voters turn to the Front National if, on their backs, Germany exports its unemployment? A reduced import deficit from Germany would allow for breathing space for the other European nations.Steffen M\u00fcllerHastings, UK \u2022 In The currency of community (9\u00a0September), his review of Joseph Stiglitz\u2019s book on the failings of the euro, John Kampfner makes the point that the present crisis in Europe embraces far more than a currency imbalance. Like it or not, the Brexit decision pinpoints wide disillusionment in the UK with the apparent evolution of the EU into an unwitting instrument of the uneven distribution of power and wealth. The imminent withdrawal of Britain may have an even greater impact on the EU. It must contribute to the growing dissent among EU members suffering the dual impacts of austerity and the influx of refugees. That the European experiment is still worth pursuing goes without saying. In our current geopolitical context, even major economies such as Germany stand little chance on their own of competing with the superpowers, China and America. It is ironic that the success of this attempt to create unity from recent disharmony now rests on whether Germany, under Angela Merkel, maintains effective leadership, or whether the various rightwing groups typified by Marine Le Pen gain effective control. Should the rightwing movements gain power, the future for a united Europe looks bleak indeed. If this, the worst possible outcome eventuates, Britain may well enjoy a short period of self-congratulation for seeing the writing on the wall.Noel BirdBoreen Point, Queensland, Australia Censorship by Facebook I read with interest the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, commenting on the recent furore over Facebook\u2019s censoring of the iconic image taken during the American war in Vietnam (16 September). The horrific image depicts Kim Ph\u00fac, as a young girl, running down a road near Trang Bang, her naked body spattered with burning napalm. Solberg states, \u201cI want my children, and other children around the world, to grow up in a society where history is told as it was. In a society where they can grow into mature adults by learning from experiences of past generations, to be better informed citizens of the world.\u201d I could not agree more. War is not only cruel because of the people that perpetrate violence. It is also cruel because of the people who fuel it. When I see this picture I see napalm. When I think napalm, I think of the Norwegian government permitting Norway to be one of the biggest suppliers of magnesium to the US production of napalm in the 50s. Cut to the present day. Norway is still a major-league global supplier of weapons (per capita). The Norwegian female ski-jumping team and Norwegian biathletes are sponsored by the Norwegian-US arms producer Nammo. Nobody is learning anything. Erna Solberg is just telling it as it is.

Later, of course, we became even more inventive and began ransacking the energy stored in the Earth. The Industrial Revolution\u2019s carbon emissions and the \u201cplastic pollution\u201d that has now spilled over into our oceans, are just two of the major, and not entirely foreseen, consequences. But the most serious development that defines our epoch according to Lovelock, in his latest book A Rough Ride to the Future, is overpopulation. \u201cGaia, the Earth System,\u201d he says, \u201ccannot sustain the present level of human population for very much longer.\u201dRichard OrlandoWestmount, Quebec, Canada Mindful of mindfulness Terry Eagleton, in his review of The Happiness Industry (26 August), does the notion of mindfulness an injustice. At the recent Mind and Life Conference with the Dalai Lama in Brussels on Power and Care, we were reminded that the pursuit of happiness involves also doing our best to reduce suffering in the world. Training in mindfulness can help some to break out of the bonds of powerlessness and feel their own strength to become better advocates for global justice. As temporary residents on this planet, we have the power and the responsibility to care enough to be, to the best of our ability, active in making a positive difference for the benefit of all creatures today and tomorrow.Silvia DingwallNussbaumen, Switzerland Briefly \u2022 I can fully sympathise with Anthony Walter (Briefly, 2 September) and his difficulty with mystifying terms used in the Weekly. It isn\u2019t just North Americans who may be flummoxed by new words that appear to have entered common parlance. I have increasingly found that my vocabulary is out of date, so that playing Scrabble creates confusion when my (1960s) dictionary doesn\u2019t contain a word that my visiting daughter thinks is commonplace.

In Canada, brown shoes were worn with a smart business suit by the new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at his swearing-in ceremony. It is a look he seemed to favour prior to his election and it did not appear to hinder his success.

The 1,800-year-old Roman arch was blown up by the extremist group last October, but a team of archeologists at Oxford University\u2019s Institute for Digital archeology (IDA) set about recreating it, in an act of resistance to Isis\u2019s rampant acts of cultural destruction in Iraq and Syria.  Standing at two-thirds the scale of the original, the arch is made of Egyptian marble and was built using 3D printing technology, based on photographs of the original arch.  Isis captured the city from government forces in May 2015, and progressively damaged its Roman-era ruins, staging mass executions in the ancient amphitheater. In addition to destroying artefacts, the extremist group looted and resold them to fund its activities.  The group also beheaded Palmyra\u2019s renowned antiquities scholar, Khaled al-Asaad, last August, because he apparently refused to reveal where valuable artefacts had been moved for safekeeping. Pro-Assad forces, who were also accused of looting Palmyra\u2019s artefacts, eventually recaptured the ancient city in March 2016.    Related: Palmyra after Isis: a visual guide    The arch historically served as the entrance to the 2,000 Temple of Baal, which was then converted to a Christian church and finally, a mosque.  First put on display in Trafalgar Square in London last April, it will stay at City Hall park for one week, before moving to its next destination, Dubai.  The 11-tonne arch was placed in the small park directly outside of New York\u2019s city hall, in the heart of the financial district. The park is usually occupied by tourists visiting city hall and the nearby World Trade Center memorial and office workers on their lunch breaks. The arch is not roped off, allowing visitors to walk under it and touch it.      A recreation of the Palmyra arch, a Roman arch destroyed by Isis, goes on display at City Hall park in New York. Photograph: Raya Jalabi for the Guardian    Palmyra itself, a former trade hub and major tourist site before the war, was located in central Syria, and its surrounding area was largely barren desert. But in New York, the arch is surrounded by ultra-modern skyscrapers and architectural landmarks including One World Trade Center and the Woolworth building. In a recent statement, Roger Michael, the Executive Director of the IDA, drew parallels between the destruction of Palmyra\u2019s landmarks and the violence that has marred London and New York\u2019s landscape. \u201cIt is our hope that the arch, itself an icon of destruction and rebirth, will remind visitors of both the universality of suffering and the indomitable human capacity to rebuild what has been lost.\u201d The IDA\u2019s dedication to preservation, means it ultimately intends to return the arch to Palmyra.  At the unveiling, deputy mayor Alicia Glen said, the arch \u201cwas a symbol that we will not stand for acts of terrorists, we will not stand to have people murdered and thrown out of their countries.\u201d Just two days earlier, there was a bombing in the city\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood injuring 29 people. \u201cWhat could be more appropriate than to have this symbol of freedom in front of City Hall, so close to where we had our own challenges,\u201d Glen added.

Related: Horse racing tips: Wednesday 21 September    \u201cOur policy will be to choose the jockey who best suits individual horses,\u201d Bin Suroor said in quotes published by the Racing Post. Doyle insists he is still \u201cexcited\u201d to be part of Godolphin\u2019s team, despite his apparent demotion after less than two years in the role. Bin Suroor was essentially tied to one jockey, Frankie Dettori, for his first 18 years as a trainer in Britain but has acquired a reputation for faithlessness since the Italian left Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s employ at the end of 2012. Silvestre de Sousa was his principal jockey the following year but by May 2014, Bin Suroor\u2019s preference had switched to Kieren Fallon. In total, he used 38 jockeys in Britain that year, with Doyle being signed up as his principal rider that November, Fallon having faded out of the picture. There was some early success for the new combination when they won two Group Ones together in Dubai in early 2015 but they have not added to that tally at the sport\u2019s highest level since. Bin Suroor may now be feeling some pressure in the closing stages of a year in which his Newmarket yard has been badly affected by a virus, and he had only three runners in the whole of August. This year may eventually prove to be the first of his career in which he fails to train a Group One winner. Charlie Appleby, meanwhile, Godolphin\u2019s other trainer in Newmarket, provided the organisation with its first Eclipse Stakes winner for 12 years when Hawkbill won the Sandown race in July. Bin Suroor told the Post: \u201cJames has ridden some nice winners for Godolphin and I hope he will ride many more. He\u2019s a friend and a big part of the Godolphin team.\u201d Doyle is quoted as saying: \u201cI fully respect it is Saeed\u2019s decision to choose who rides the horses in his care. I\u2019m incredibly proud to wear the blue silks and will continue to ride for Godolphin whenever asked. It\u2019s a great team. \u201cWhen I was appointed along with William Buick to be a stable jockey for Godolphin \u2026 it was unquestionably one of the greatest days of my professional career.\u201d Doyle will hope to follow the example of De Sousa, who became champion jockey in the year after being ditched by Godolphin. Doyle had previously shown his skills as a big-race rider when bagging Group Ones on Cityscape, Al Kazeem, Rizeena, Kingman and Noble Mission, building a reputation that seems sure to survive his fall from Bin Suroor\u2019s favour. Buick now appears to be the de facto No1 jockey for the whole of Godolphin\u2019s British operation, a significant improvement on his fortunes from midsummer, when he served a month-long ban after being rude to raceday stewards in France. At Goodwood on Wednesday he will partner Bin Suroor\u2019s Sky Hunter in a Listed contest which is thought to be a prep-race for the horse on the way to the Melbourne Cup. At Newmarket on Thursday, Buick will ride both of Bin Suroor\u2019s runners while Doyle treks to Pontefract for a single ride.

Feezan Hameed, 23, partied with pop stars while splashing out on Rolex watches, jewellery and trips to Dubai, London\u2019s Southwark crown court heard. The Glasgow-based criminal, known as Fizzy, owned several luxury cars including a Bentley and a Lamborghini, paid for from the takings of a \u00a33m-a-month fraud, which involved duping victims over the phone into thinking they were having a conversation with their bank. He was eventually caught after targeting 750 RBS customers in the biggest cyberfraud the Metropolitan police had seen. It can be revealed that he was jailed for 11 years last week at Southwark crown court after restrictions were lifted. He admitted conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to convert and transfer criminal property. Hameed flew people 8,000 miles from Scotland to Pakistan to polish his fleet of Porsche Cayennes outside his villa in Lahore, the court heard.  Michael Shorrock QC, prosecuting, described the fraud as \u201ca nationwide conspiracy to defraud companies and businesses by hacking into their bank accounts and stealing large sums of money\u201d between January 2013 and October 2015. \u201cLiterally within a blink of an eye, this money was being moved from one account to another,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fraudsters were able to interfere with the telephone system of the bank customers, so the customer was unable to receive calls while the fraud was taking place.\u201d Pitman Blackstock Solicitors were fleeced out of \u00a32,260,625.89 after getting a call from someone called \u201cPeter\u201d, who claimed that he was from the security department of Lloyds Bank. In another instance, \u00a3750,000 was transferred in seconds. Hameed used aliases including \u201cSimon Hughes\u201d and \u201cMatthew Fraser\u201d and would tell unwitting customers that they had been hacked by \u201csomeone in Aberdeen called Stevenson or King\u201d. He was the \u201cleader and prime mover\u201d and made almost all the calls, the court heard, making sure that they appeared to be coming from a location that would not arise suspicion. Hameed would claim to be a member of the bank fraud department when he called customers, before persuading them to reveal their internet banking details in a \u201cvery persuasive, very articulate\u201d manner, Scotland Yard said.  While Hameed kept victims talking, his associates would gain access to their bank accounts and empty them. The fraudsters used a \u201cnetwork of money mules\u201d to disperse the cash, before it was laundered to Dubai and Pakistan. Between January 2013 and October 2015, the gang took \u00a3113m from victims, of which \u00a347m has been recovered. The outstanding amount is believed to have been laundered from the UK.  The scam was brought to an end in a series of police raids in Glasgow and the West Midlands last year. Hameed took \u00a3500,000-\u00a31.5m a month, prosecutors said. He spent time with the Pakistani singer Bilal Saeed and claimed to have been producing a music video for him, the court heard. Hameed was arrested after trying to board a flight from Paris to Pakistan with a fake passport last November. He was then returned to the UK to face trial. DCI Andrew Gould said: \u201cWhen they were at their height, when they\u2019d really got the hang of this, they were probably making \u00a31m-\u00a32m a week. \u201cIt was a Monday-to-Friday, nine-to-five operation, and when they were busy and active, they were just smashing victims all day, every day, running their criminal business like a proper business.\u201d  The gang were extremely sophisticated in their techniques, displaying false telephone numbers on the phones of victims and disposing of prepaid phones and dongles once they had completed a hit.  Hameed kept clear of the cash and was treated with \u201crespect and deference\u201d by the rest of the group, despite only being in his twenties.  \u201cHe is very much the controlling guy, totally in charge,\u201d Gould said. \u201cThe kind of guy that when he flies to Dubai for a weekend shopping with his chums, they all fly economy, he flies first class.\u201d  DC Neil O\u2019Sullivan of the Metropolitan police\u2019s Falcon (online crime and fraud) unit said: \u201cThis was the largest covert proactive operation the Met has ever undertaken against cyber-enabled crime.\u201d Other members of the gang were also sentenced. Hameed\u2019s brother Nouman Choudhary, 22, acted as the accountant, investing money in properties in Scotland and Pakistan. Nouman was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for conspiracy to launder money. A confiscation hearing is set for 3 May 2017. Abdul Iqbal, 23, of Edinburgh, was sentenced to 21 months for conspiracy to money launder.

Related: James Doyle loses leading role for Saeed bin Suroor as William Buick books in    That total could not be immediately verified because details of winners in his native Dubai are not readily available but Bin Suroor\u2019s 22-year career has been hugely impressive on any reading. His tally of winners in Britain alone now stands at 1,383 and there have been close to 200 top-class successes in countries all around the globe. But Bin Suroor has yet to add to that Group One total this year, in which his yard seems to have been as badly affected by a virus as any in Newmarket. Fascinatingly, he defended himself by claiming that Godolphin has not been sending him quite the same calibre of animal that he used to get. \u201cThe quality of horses we have in my stable is completely different than 20 years ago. At that time, we received all the horses and the best quality yearlings but the last three years, the quality wasn\u2019t really good enough. The three-year-olds this year weren\u2019t really good. \u201cBut the two-year-olds are nice, they\u2019re doing good, some of them. In their work, this week and last, they show some class and I hope some of them will become stars from there.\u201d That theme came up again when Bin Suroor was asked to pick some career highlights, having reached such a significant landmark. \u201cDubai Millennium, Fantastic Light, Daylami when he won at the Breeders\u2019 Cup, Lammtarra, so many. It\u2019s hard to choose, but all were stars.\u201d With some emphasis, he added: \u201cWe miss them, big time.\u201d Sky Hunter, partnered here by William Buick, is probably not the horse Bin Suroor needs to get back in the big time. This was just a Listed contest, practically gifted to him by a mulish effort from the favourite, Mount Logan. He was well beaten in last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup and, even after this success, is available at 100-1 for the race on 1 November. Bin Suroor would not be drawn on riding plans for the Flemington handicap, in which he could also run Beautiful Romance, Secret Number and others. While he did not want to address the Doyle news, he was clearly keen to play down \u00a0its\u00a0significance and pointed to Friday\u2019s declarations at Newmarket, where he will have runners in two Listed races and has booked Doyle for one and Buick for the other. Fundamentally, Bin Suroor now wants to be free to choose the jockey he thinks best for the horse and the occasion and his Godolphin employers are content to let him have that freedom. He expects Doyle will remain part of his team next year and beyond but the jockey is talented enough to attract other offers. Press room speculation suggested Godolphin may yet try to arrange a return to this country for James McDonald, the young New Zealander who won a Group Two in their colours during Glorious week here in July. Sacred Act, who has been a well-backed favourite for Saturday\u2019s Cambridgeshire Handicap, is likely to miss the race after John Gosden, his trainer, found the horse to be stiff in a hindquarter on Wednesday night. \u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s 99% unlikely to be declared in the morning,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity.\u201d The trainer cannot yet be sure if the injury is a muscle tear or something more significant, leaving open the possibility of the horse running again this year. Gosden did have better news concerning Jack Hobbs, last year\u2019s Irish Derby winner, who is expected to return to action in Ascot\u2019s Champion Stakes next month.

Illegal waste activity costs England \u00a31bn a year and more than 1,000 illegal waste sites were discovered last year, more than in the previous two years combined, with 662 still active as of the end of March. The offences, sometimes involving organised crime gangs, ranged from illegal dumping of household and industrial waste to massive frauds involving recycling fees and landfill tax. However, action by the EA led to almost 1,000 illegal sites being shut down last year, with fines and prosecutions doubling. \u201cWaste is the new narcotics,\u201d said Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency. \u201cIt feels to me like drugs felt in the 1980s: the system hadn\u2019t quite woken up to the enormity of what was going on and was racing to catch up.\u201d     Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, at a reformed waste site. Photograph: Damian Carrington for the Guardian    Bevan told the Guardian that waste crime can have a serious impact on communities: \u201cWhen you have an illegal waste site, it will look horrible, it will smell, be noisy and there are constantly fires. \u201cWith drugs it took a while for the system to catch up and realise the damage drugs were doing. We are clear now about the damage waste crime does to communities and to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strategy is to work with the good guys and really nail the bad guys. \u201cWe are both finding more [illegal sites] and nailing more. As the statistics show we haven\u2019t cracked it yet and it will be a long grind, but we are making progress.\u201d In July, a Leeds waste criminal was given a record prison sentence for any environmental crime, a seven-and-a-half year term. Terence Dugbo had defrauded the electrical waste recycling industry out of \u00a32.2m in a scam involving almost 20,000 tonnes of waste. He was caught when seized documents revealed waste had supposedly been collected from non-existent streets and, in one incident, a moped was recorded as carrying 991 televisions and 413 fridges in a single trip. In August, a Sussex man was jailed after illegally stockpiling more than 1,200 tonnes of waste, having been arrested at Heathrow trying to board a plane to Dubai. In September a notorious Hampshire waste criminal was sent to prison for a string of offences including large-scale flytipping. Large fines have been imposed too, with a London waste company fined \u00a31m in April in a case involving 14,500 tonnes of hazardous waste, including asbestos. \u201cIt attracts criminals because you can make a lot of money,\u201d said Bevan. \u201cThe business model is very simple: you lease or find a bit of land, you then go and offer to remove skip loads of waste for a customer, which you dump on the land. All your money is made up front, in cash, and then you disappear.\u201d  In May 2015, a Burton upon Trent man was jailed for seven months after using the land owned by a vulnerable local couple to dump and burn large quantities of waste, leaving the site in a state of complete ruin.     Illegally dumped tyres are counted by the Environment Agency. Photograph: Environment Agency    However, Bevan said it was also important to work with waste companies that wanted to improve their operations: \u201cWaste companies get a bad rap, but we should recognise that most waste companies are responsible, law-abiding, conscientious and good for our communities. They take our waste away and turn it into something better and if we didn\u2019t have them, we\u2019d be in a bad place.\u201d Bevan spoke to the Guardian on a visit to Orion Support Services, a company in east London that handles 50,000 tonnes of construction waste from the city each year. Its permit was suspended in 2015 after serious dust problems. However, the company has now built a \u00a32.4m enclosed facility for sorting the waste, with a system that collects and bags 50 litres of dust an hour. \u201cIt was either that or shut up shop and go home,\u201d said John Stride, managing director of Orion Services. \u201cBut the turnaround has been amazing and it will pay back.\u201d Just a small percentage of the waste sorted by Orion goes to landfill, with most being recycled or burned for energy. \u201cIt just feels better now, when you are reusing it,\u201d Stride said, adding that a neighbour who had raised a 1,000-strong petition against Orion\u2019s operations was now \u201cvery friendly\u201d. Overall, England is much dealing better with waste than in the past, said Bevan. Rubbish sent to landfill has halved since 2000 and household recycling reached a new high in 2015 of 45%. However, the rising recycling rate has flattened out in recent years, and the proportion sent to landfill increased slightly in 2015. \u201cEngland is getting a better place to live - greener, cleaner and more prosperous,\u201d said Bevan. \u201cThere is more to do, absolutely, but the glass is half full.\u201d \u201cIt is in part an example of regulation working,\u201d said Bevan, a former high commissioner to India. \u201cI have seen an example of what happens if you don\u2019t regulate - the Bhopal disaster.

Inga Beale, Lloyd\u2019s chief executive.

The group reported a profit of \u00a31.46bn for the first half of this year, up 22% from \u00a31.2bn a year ago.

Judge Gabriel W Gorenstein said on Wednesday night that while an arrested person must appear before the court \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d, he agreed with government claims that Rahami was currently being held under state charges and did not yet need to appear in court.  Rahami, 28, remains in the hospital in Newark, New Jersey, recovering from injuries sustained in a shootout with police during his arrest on Monday. Public defenders had suggested he might make his first court appearance from his hospital bed. But Gorenstein said there was no evidence to contradict government claims that he has not been arrested on federal charges, and is still being held on state charges; therefore he does not have to immediately appear before a federal court, the judge said.   Related: New York and New Jersey bombings: who is suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami?    On Tuesday, federal authorities charged Rahami with bombing, property destruction and the use of weapons of mass destruction regarding the bombing in Chelsea on Saturday night that injured 31 people, as well as pipe bombs planted in Seaside Park, New Jersey, on Saturday and in Elizabeth, New Jersey, on Sunday night.  In a new interview, Rahami\u2019s father, Mohammad Rahami, offered more information on what he told the FBI when he contacted them in 2014 to share his concerns about his son\u2019s interest in terrorism, following a domestic incident in which the younger Rahami stabbed his brother.  \u201cI told the FBI to keep an eye on him,\u201d Mohammad Rahami told the New York Times. \u201cThey said, \u2018Is he a terrorist?\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t guarantee you 100% if he is a terrorist. I don\u2019t know which groups he is in. I can\u2019t tell you.\u2019\u201d But he did share with the FBI the specific behaviors that concerned him.  \u201cThe way he speaks, his videos, when I see these things that he listens to, for example, al-Qaida, Taliban, he watches their videos, their poetry,\u201d he said he told authorities. Rahami\u2019s wife, Asia Bibi Rahami, flew into New York from Dubai on Wednesday night to speak with authorities about her husband. Asia Rahami is a Pakistani national who reportedly wed Rahami during his 2014 visit to Pakistan. It was an arranged marriage, reported CBS, who said she is working with investigators and is not considered a suspect. When Rahami returned from Pakistan after marrying Asia, customs officials flagged him and put him through secondary screening, reported the New York Times. After concerns over his travel history, which included a trip to Turkey in 2014 when authorities were concerned about foreigners heading there to fight in Syria, customs officials contacted the National Targeting Center, a federal agency that examines potential threats, said the Times. A US official told the Guardian on Tuesday that Rahami was not on any US watchlists.     In his journal, Rahami fumed that the US government was slaughtering Muslim holy warriors and alluded to plans for revenge. Photograph: AP    The blood-stained notebook found with Rahami echoes the ideas raised by Isis spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, according to the Times. Adnani had called on followers unable to join the fight in Syria to take up their own arms and commit violence at home. On one page of his notebook, Rahami wrote:  \u201cback to Sham [a name used for Syria] \u2026 \u2026 Guidance come / Sheikh Anwar / Brother Adnani / Dawla. Said it clearly attack The Kuffar in their backyard.\u201d  Authorities view this as a reference to Adnani\u2019s speech in May to commit pro-Isis attacks against western citizens in their home countries. Police began their pursuit of of Rahami on Sunday, after the bombs in New York and New Jersey on Saturday, explained CBS. They feared Rahami was trying to escape in a car, and stopped the car near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which runs from Staten Island to Brooklyn, on Sunday night. But it was a false alarm: the five people in the car were related to Rahami, but he was not in the car himself.  Meanwhile the FBI continued to search for two men who found a second, unexploded pressure cooker device that prosecutors say Rahami left in a piece of luggage in Chelsea on Saturday night.  The two men, who took the bag but left the improvised bomb on the street, are not suspects, officials said, but investigators want to interview them as witnesses.  \u201cThey\u2019re not in any jeopardy of being arrested,\u201d Jim Watters, chief of the New York police department\u2019s counter-terrorism unit, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe have no reason to believe they\u2019re connected.\u201d  Prosecutors said surveillance video shows Rahami rolling a suitcase down the street, then abandoning it on the sidewalk where that second device was found.  A few minutes later, two men pass by the luggage and appear to admire it, police said. They then remove a pressure cooker from the luggage, leave the pressure cooker on the sidewalk and walk away with the luggage.  \u201cI think they were more interested in the bag, not what they were taking out,\u201d Watters said, adding that they were \u201cvery, very lucky\u201d the bomb didn\u2019t explode. The attacks in New York and New Jersey were the latest in a series in the US inspired by Islamic militant groups including al-Qaida and Islamic State.  A pair of ethnic Chechen brothers killed three people and injured more than 260 others at the Boston marathon in 2013 with homemade pressure-cooker bombs similar to those used in this weekend\u2019s attacks.

Oxford has just topped the Times Higher Education global ranking table, beating the best US universities \u2013 California Institute of Technology (better known as Caltech), Harvard, Princeton and MIT; two other British universities, Cambridge and Imperial, are in the top 10. Only US institutions are better represented in the world\u2019s top 1,000 universities. It is boom time for higher education, as universities invest their students\u2019 \u00a39,000 a year fees in shiny new labs, libraries and sports facilities to compete for students after the lifting of the cap on numbers last year. But in years to come, 2016 may look like the high point before the decline: the consequences of Brexit, a slump in the number of 18-year-olds and, above all, a misconceived higher education bill, will all take their toll. As we report today, universities are making plans for a much chillier future.   Related: UK universities draw up plans for EU campuses ahead of Brexit    The immediate problem is uncertainty. No one knows what effect leaving the EU will have. Britain is the second most popular destination for overseas students: each year more than 70,000 students come from other EU countries, a bit more than 5% of the total undergraduates. Now, they pay the same fees as UK students; after Brexit they will have to pay double, the full international student rate, and they will not be eligible for loans. Universities tell this year\u2019s applicants their funding is guaranteed, but there is no similar guarantee for next year\u2019s intake. That is likely to hit recruitment, just as the fall in 18-year-olds reaches its lowest level. And it is not just numbers: along with undergraduates, postgraduates and postdoc researchers who may be deterred in future, 14% of universities\u2019 research funding comes from EU\u00a0programmes \u2013 much more in some faculties \u2013 often forming the basis for important research partnerships. Some universities are considering opening European campuses so they can continue to work with EU colleagues, just as they have already opened extensions in countries such as India, China, Malaysia and Dubai. Into this disrupted ecology, the government is pushing ahead with its higher education and research bill. It is promoted as a way of increasing competition and promoting social mobility. Public administration of universities devolves on to a new Office for Students, composed of government appointees, which will be able not only to award degree-conferring powers to new entrant, for-profit institutions \u2013 soon Britain too could have a Trump university \u2013 but to take them away from existing ones (even, in theory, Oxford and Cambridge). The\u00a0OFS will manage the controversial teacher excellence framework, which will influence the fees universities can charge. The bill \u201centrenches the notion of universities as suppliers of courses rather than as educators, and of students as consumers\u201d, said a letter to the Financial Times this week from more than 70 academics. It also reinvents arrangements for research funding, amalgamating all nine existing research councils into a single entity, UK Research and\u00a0Innovation.

So ancient neighbourhoods are demolished and fields give way to spreading slums. No Knives in the Kitchens of This City won the Naguib Mahfouz medal for literature. As in many of Mahfouz\u2019s novels, Khalifa\u2019s urban environment develops a power somewhere between metaphor and symbol: \u201cThe alley was witness to the destruction of my mother\u2019s dreams, and the idea of this alley grew to encompass the length and breadth of the country.\u201d During the early 1980s war between the regime and the Muslim Brotherhood, Aleppo became \u201ca place of retribution\u201d. This conflict was the setting for Khalifa\u2019s earlier prizewinner In Praise of Hatred, but here the focus moves from political violence to the social and psychological violence \u2013 harassment, rape and suicide \u2013 that comes in its wake. The narrator\u2019s uncle, Nizar, is one of several gay characters. Scorned by half the family, once imprisoned for \u201csodomy\u201d and raped in jail by an imam, he finds brief freedom in Beirut, until his money runs out. Khalifa believes \u201cit is the duty of writing to help break down taboos and clash with fixed and backward concepts\u201d. He is by no means the first Arab novelist to write about homosexuality, but he treats the topic with greater sensitivity and sympathy than, for instance, Alaa al-Aswany does in The Yacoubian Building. Nizar\u2019s niece, Sawsan, who is \u201cirrepressible\u201d, swings between the extremes available. As a student, she joins a regime militia, informs on her friends and forcibly removes hijabs. After sojourns in Dubai and Paris, she returns home, has her hymen repaired and immerses herself in prayer. Her brother, Rashid, an accomplished violinist, experiences a similar trajectory. At first he wears earplugs and disdains \u201cthe herd\u201d; later, he throws himself into it, pursuing jihad in occupied Iraq. Shame is a key theme, and the general rage for orthodoxy: sexual, religious and political. A woman is stripped naked in the street for refusing to wear a badge bearing the president\u2019s face. And Aleppo\u2019s \u201ccapitulation to shame [is] made manifest in the posters and slogans and symbols hung on its walls\u201d.    The writing is superb \u2013 a dense, luxurious realism pricked with surprising metaphors    It is not surprising, in this context, that the characters are often depicted toiling hard to forget their desires, ugly compromises or snatches of happiness. But their willed forgetfulness contributes to the city\u2019s destruction: \u201cAleppo itself was as ephemeral as the act of forgetting; anything which remained of its true form would become a lie, reinvented by us day after day.\u201d So, argues Khalifa, people must commit to a desperate remembering. The past is \u201cthe sole reason for living\u201d, narrated \u201cin revenge for a present\u201d too terrible to contemplate. The novel (and Khalifa too, writing from Damascus) recalls Aleppo\u2019s cinemas and haute cuisine, music recitals and bar culture, prostitutes and shrines. It often sounds like an elevated form of gossip, each story generating more stories, every anecdote opening into further digression. It has the sense, too, of a lament: four out of five chapters, with an obsessive circularity, begin with the narrator\u2019s mother\u2019s death. No Knives in the Kitchens of this City is intricately plotted, chronologically complicated and a pleasure to read. The profusion of characters defuses its narrative urgency, but gives it psychological and social depth. The writing is superb \u2013 a dense, luxurious realism pricked with surprising metaphors. It is lyrical, sensuous and so semantically rich that at times it resembles a prose poem, an effect occasionally marred by slightly clumsy translation. A sad but beautiful book, providing important human context to the escalating Syrian tragedy. \u2022 No Knives in the Kitchens of This City is published by American University in Cairo Press.

Now, just days before the 41st Ryder Cup gets under way at Hazeltine, a meeting of the United States and Europe has reinvigorated the charismatic Englishman. Poulter would, of course, never lack passion in the context of a Ryder Cup. He would be affronted at the suggestion of manufactured incentive. Still, in piecing together the journey that will see him form part of Darren Clarke\u2019s backroom team as a vice-captain, it is clear this role has relit a competitive fire. \u201cIt is going to be really strange, I have got to be honest,\u201d says Poulter of vice-captaincy business. \u201cI obviously wanted to play but found myself in a situation where I had to take myself out of that equation.   Related: Ryder Cup 2016: US face pressure test as Darren Clarke backs young team    \u201cIt is very different. I am not sure how I will feel but I am going to embrace it 100% and give the team all the energy I can possibly give them. It will just inspire me to come back a few weeks later on with a view to making 2018 in France. \u201cThere is plenty of good stuff left in this chassis of mine. I am not giving up the ghost just yet. I still think I have a couple of Ryder Cups in me.\u201d Poulter\u2019s injury woes had become acute late in 2015, when he struggled through events in Turkey and Dubai with deep pain in the second toe of his right foot. It was subsequently diagnosed as arthritis; the man who has turned out five times for Europe, tasting defeat only once, was thereby presented with a professional dilemma. \u201cI was crying out for pain relief and that\u2019s why I started a process of cortisone injections,\u201d the 40-year-old explains. \u201cIt was only really masking the pain, it only took the edge off it. It got really bad by the Phoenix Open in February and that\u2019s when it became an issue of \u2018Shit, what\u2019s the prognosis?\u2019 \u201cIt was only early in the season, I wanted to push and make the Ryder Cup team and by doing that it meant more cortisone to try and get through but in the end you just have to say \u2018OK, that\u2019s not going to work and we need to address the situation\u2019.\u201d External chatter surrounded Poulter\u2019s poor results. \u201cThat was difficult because it is not for me to openly come out and tell everyone everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let on how hurt you are because some people will see that as a sign of weakness, they might use it against you. I just wasn\u2019t openly telling people about numerous cortisone injections and struggling with pain. I think I open up enough.\u201d Poulter now has renewed enthusiasm and, perhaps, purpose. His aspirations of returning to the summit of golf should not be disregarded; this is a player who progressed from selling Mars bars in a golf shop and a virtually anonymous amateur career to compete with the world\u2019s best. His propensity for proving doubters wrong is already obvious. \u201cI am hopeful that I will play the British Masters [in October], which will be brilliant,\u201d Poulter says. \u201cI\u2019d like to play. If I don\u2019t play the British Masters, I\u2019ll play the week after in Malaysia.   Related: Ian Poulter says Tiger Woods Ryder Cup role is smart move by USA    \u201cMy fitness feels pretty good. I have been working hard on my game over the last three or four weeks and I feel in decent shape. I have no pain in my right foot, which is really good news. I have been working with some laser therapy treatment because I can\u2019t use any more cortisone injections. I have gone down the road of laser therapy, which has helped massively. It has taken away inflammation and pain, which is great news. I have found a treatment which has been pretty successful. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken anti-inflammatories or painkillers now for four months. Without doing that, I feel a lot better in myself. Long-term effects of taking painkillers and anti-inflammatories are never really good. To find another form of relief has been great. I can do as much practice as I want in a day. I\u2019m fatigued, like everyone else, but there is nothing I can\u2019t do like I was doing back in the day. Everything is back to normal, which is great news. \u201cThere has been a lot going on, on and off the course, and it has been tough but, in a way, having an enforced break has been healthy from a mindset perspective. To have that extra time with the family, to have extra time away from the game, makes me hungry to come back. I really do see it as a good thing. \u201cThe main factor is just being pain free. I have never needed operations, I have had niggles the same as any other golfer after putting his body through 17 years of travel and a heavy playing schedule. I think I\u2019m actually in pretty good shape considering the amount of hours spent hitting balls and sitting on an aeroplane.\u201d So to the immediate task in hand. In following what feels like European strategy, Poulter agrees with bookmakers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the upper hand,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been the underdogs before, we are the underdogs this time, we have come out on top so many times we can only hope that continues.\u201d Legitimate underdogs? A team that has won three Ryder Cups in succession? \u201cOn paper we are,\u201d Poulter insists. \u201cIf you add the world rankings up and average it out, we would have to be the underdogs. How else would you do it? You\u2019d have to say on world ranking points, since the last Ryder Cup the cumulative lowest-ranked players have to be the favourites, right?\u201d Clarke\u2019s involvement of Poulter may have seemed a no-brainer to the outside world but the captain could still have had doubts over including someone with greater Ryder Cup presence than himself. Admiration here is mutual; Poulter views Clarke as a natural European leader. \u201cHe is an absolute perfectionist,\u201d says Poulter of the 2011 Open champion. \u201cDarren has done a fantastic job so far. He is going into as much detail as he possibly can, he has given us as much detail as he possibly can. He isn\u2019t leaving any stone unturned. \u201cHe has played under great captains and has been a vice-captain. With that knowledge, I think he is going to do a good job. But it is difficult as a captain; once you let the players go on the 1st tee, there isn\u2019t an awful lot you can do. I am going to be feeling that for the first time, the standpoint where you can\u2019t physically intervene. \u201cI think I will be quite helpful with the rookies. All the vice-captains have been rookies at some stage. It is about making sure the team is comfortable. That\u2019s why you have five different vice-captain personalities there; different players get on with different people. \u201cIt comes down to being able to chat to the players and making sure you are prepared if Darren needs information at a certain time. You have to do your homework so that when it comes down to meetings of captain and vice-captains, you have to come up with a similar answer to what he is thinking. That\u2019s what has been successful for us in the past. There hasn\u2019t been to-ing and fro-ing, there haven\u2019t been last-minute changes. People have been on the same page, have been very thorough.\u201d Poulter makes no secret of a desire to captain Europe himself in the future. Unlike Lee Westwood, who has pinpointed 2020, Poulter will not offer a specific juncture. \u201cThat\u2019s also why it was nice for Darren to ask me this time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an honour and one day down the road, if I get asked then I have armed myself with experience like this. It will hopefully be very valuable.\u201d Poulter is understanding of the United States and their task force approach to potentially reviving Ryder Cup fortunes. Unlike Westwood, he sees the vice-captaincy of Tiger Woods in a wholly positive light. \u201cHe has won the most majors in the modern era so he can only be talking from experience,\u201d says Poulter. \u201cI can only think whatever Tiger has to add to that team is a good thing. There is no one in the game who is close to what he has achieved in the last couple of decades. You\u2019d think he will bring plenty.\u201d So should Poulter. Just don\u2019t dare suggest this as the onset of a non-playing journey.", "title": "Ian Poulter: \u2018I\u2019m not giving up the ghost \u2013 I still have a couple of Ryder Cups in me\u2019", "sentences": ["I still think I have a couple of Ryder Cups in me.\u201d Poulter\u2019s injury woes had become acute late in 2015, when he struggled through events in Turkey and Dubai with deep pain in the second toe of his right foot."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-24T19:41:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/25/yazemeenah-rossi-sexy-means-alive", "tags": ["Models", "Life and style", "Fashion", "Photography", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "It makes sense that model and photographer Yazemeenah Rossi\u2019s muse is nature. Her sparse Malibu studio is decorated with rocks and crystals. The air is filled with meditation music.

She brings some chai in a ceramic mug \u2013 one she made while taking classes during her New York years.

It gives them a desire to find a way themselves.\u201d At 60 years of age, the grandmother of two didn\u2019t think twice about taking her own self-portraits in lingerie she received from New York-based designers Land of Women earlier this year. She sent the shots direct to them, and they were so inspiring in their age-defying honesty that the company decided to shoot her \u2013 unedited \u2013 for their summer 2016 swimwear campaign.

Born in 1955 in Corsica, she was raised by her grandparents \u2013 their financial situation slightly better than her parents\u2019. Her grandparents had no running water or electricity, but they ran a restaurant on the beach. \u201cCan you imagine how amazing?\u201d she asks. She recalls the river where they washed, her grandfather\u2019s garden where he grew fruit and vegetables and her grandmother carrying water in a pot on her head. The water inspired her photography. Her first camera was gifted to her at the age of 11, when she eventually started to spend more time with her parents. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have money for film.

Photograph: Simon Emmett for the Observer    Snapshots of nature were an escape from an estranged relationship with her parents, one defined by constant arguing. It worsened when she became pregnant at 16. She hid her pregnancy for five months, terrified her father would force her to abort. She married the father before the child was born and moved to Paris. By the age of 20 she\u2019d had a second child. \u201cFor me [it felt like] I was in jail. My life was finished. Sometimes I\u2019d say, \u2018I would love to not have my kids\u2019.\u201d At 28 she began to realise that the pursuit of her own happiness was too important. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay with a man I didn\u2019t love just to pay my bills. So I divorced. Work came. When you make the right choice, the universe brings.\u201d    I\u2019ve lost a lot of money because I refuse to do things that aren\u2019t right for me    Soon enough her sister, who worked in fashion retail, invited her to stand in as a last-minute model for one of her clients during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cThey gave me an envelope with my money, but it came up short. Imagine! I went back and fought to get my money.\u201d Beginning a career in her forthright way, she spent 10 years working as a fittings model for Herm\u00e8s and YSL. \u201cI stood on high heels all day, while they made clothes on me and smoked. It was terrible, but I was thankful I could raise my kids.\u201d One job was so awful she tore up a contract in front of the client\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of money because I refuse to do things that aren\u2019t right for me.\u201d She shrugs. Today\u2019s fashion industry still glorifies youth, particularly in women, and sees them as less distinct when they reach their 40s and 50s. \u201cMy work as a model is just a part of it,\u201d says Rossi. \u201cI am a role model, I\u2019m in touch with my individuality.\u201d Her smooth skin is as vital as any 20-something\u2019s.

Photograph: Simon Emmett for the Observer    Rossi entered the industry at the age of 30, and her big breaks didn\u2019t come until she moved to America. Arriving in New York first in 1999, and represented by Ford models, she was hired on print campaigns for US brands such as Bloomingdale\u2019s, Barneys, J Crew and Bobbi Brown. This was despite her hair having already gone completely white. She unties her wet tresses and shows off blue-black roots that remain underneath thick grey. She never thought about dying it. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I have no time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s silver!\u201d Her eyebrows are speckled with white, too. She\u2019s refused \u201ca lot of money\u201d to change it.    This is not courage. This is simply who I am. If more models are authentic, it will impact people who see them    Such \u201cwoman\u2019s work\u201d can be time-consuming, detracting from the pursuit of other goals.

She started Bikram in her 30s after years of windsurfing. \u201cIt gives me a wow feeling!\u201d Sex, too, keeps her young. In 2007, Rossi left New York for California. Her second husband, an Algerian restaurateur, didn\u2019t accompany her. \u201cLife put us apart,\u201d she says, lightly. Her sexual freedom is positively progressive. \u201cWomen feel guilty about masturbating.

He missed a friendly with Brazil in Rio apparently to scout Italy but, in truth, to travel to Dubai to negotiate a four-year contract to manage the United Arab Emirates worth \u00a3340,000 annually. He then sold news of his departure to the Daily Mail before the FA had received his formal resignation letter. The FA duly suspended Revie from football for 10 years, a ban which was overturned in court after a ruling that the governing body had overreached its powers. Yet it transpired that the Daily Mirror had actually been conducting a lengthy enquiry into suggestions Revie had been fixing matches, details of which were later handed to the FA in a 315-page dossier. Revie sued the Mirror for libel, but did not pursue his legal action.   Related: Sam Allardyce fights to save England manager\u2019s job in FA crisis talks    Terry Venables Venables was appointed England coach in January 1994 but, while he retained various business ventures outside his day job, it was various legal proceedings \u2013 not least with the then owner of Tottenham Hotspur, Alan Sugar \u2013 which served as a regular distraction and were why the FA stressed that the new man was the coach, not the manager. Four months after taking up the reins of the national team he lost a high-court battle with Sugar to have his company, Edennote plc, wound up. In August of that year, police dropped an inquiry into allegations Venables had paid the former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough a \u00a358,750 \u201cbung\u201d to arrange the transfer of Teddy Sheringham to Spurs and, in November 1995, he called in Scotland Yard to investigate a \u201cconcerted and organised campaign to discredit him\u201d. The case was subsequently dropped without any charges having been brought as the police were unable to find any evidence of wrongdoing. In January 1996, Venables announced he would be standing down as England coach after Euro\u00a096 because of court cases due to be heard later in the year which he felt would interfere with the national side\u2019s efforts to qualify for the 1998 World Cup. As it transpired, he became director of football at second-tier Portsmouth in July 1996 having conducted a review of his legal commitments and discovered they would not be as heavy as initially anticipated. In 1998 he was disqualified as a company director for seven years. Sven-Goran Eriksson The Swede\u2019s preparations for his first World Cup finals in charge of England included the launch of a three\u2011CD box-set of his favourite classical music tracks. The collection, released on the label Naxos, came out in the April before the 2002 tournament and included 17 pieces by British composers, from Elgar to Purcell, Walton to Delius. Triumphalist favourites such as Jerusalem and The Dam Busters March were included. The second CD featured European classical pieces, and the third works by Scandinavian composers. Eriksson did not stop there. He had tie-ups with Cirio del Monte pasta sauces, a television advert for Sainsbury\u2019s alongside Jamie Oliver, and two Sony PlayStation games: Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s World Cup Challenge, and Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s World Cup manager. One reviewer of the games suggested \u201cthe greatest challenge is actually deciding which is worst\u201d, describing them as \u201ca dismal experience\u201d. There were, of course, other distractions. He was photographed meeting the then Chelsea chief executive, Peter Kenyon, in 2004 apparently discussing potentially succeeding Claudio Ranieri at Stamford Bridge, only then to sign a two-year extension with the national setup. Then, in the buildup to the 2006 World Cup, there was his meeting with the News of the World\u2019s Fake Sheikh \u2013 over \u00a3900 worth of vintage champagne and lobster at a seven-star Dubai hotel and on a luxury yacht in the Gulf city\u2019s marina \u2013 when he suggested he was prepared to become the \u00a35m-a-year manager of Aston Villa, and where he appeared to offer to \u201ctap up\u201d the national captain David Beckham to move to Villa Park under his stewardship.

The manager\u2019s contract, as with other FA employees, included a clause requiring him to obtain prior approval for external business ventures, but this was ignored when he agreed to contribute to the Italian businessman Chicco Merighi\u2019s online venture. At the launch, at which Capello spoke, he was described as cofounder of the player-rating site which had been two years in creation, though he later claimed he received no payment for his involvement. The site rated players according to a complex formula that was developed using Capello\u2019s expertise and, while it apparently did not rely upon his personal assessments, the likelihood remained that the formula would be applied to members of his own England squad. His name and likeness were eventually removed from the site, after much lobbying by a flustered FA, but the venture continued to rate players.

Bruce McAvaney, adopting the unshakable postural arc of a veteran racing caller, stands from his chair and stoops forward slightly in the Seven broadcasting booth, binoculars firmly pressed to his eyes as he motors through another rapid-fire description of the action unfolding beyond the glass. His voice deepens to the kind of ecstatic growl every football fan knows well. The growl is the same whether McAvaney\u2019s calling the opening bounce of a cut-throat final or junk time in a pre-season blowout.  Calmly seated beside him is Dennis Cometti; immaculately blazered, liberally hairsprayed and laconic. From his chair Cometti alternates between a panoramic view of the ground, his carefully-prepared notes and a small TV monitor on the desk in front of him. He absorbs McAvaney\u2019s description through his right ear, mentally limbering up for his own entrance. The opening is something Cometti can sense from decades spent as McAvaney\u2019s co-pilot on hundreds of football broadcasts but also by his colleague\u2019s cadence \u2013 sometimes wearied and flagging but with McAvaney, just as often a spittle-inducing parabola whose upward peak pushes the limits of human oxygen intake. When Bruce\u2019s bolt is shot, his left arm comes down and he tags his offsider into the fray with a collegial hand on the shoulder. Dennis Cometti is away. So endures Australian sports broadcasting\u2019s premier double act, or so it has, until this weekend, when at the conclusion of the AFL grand final Cometti peels off his headset, rolls back his chair and rises next to his favourite colleague one last time. After 49 years in broadcasting \u2013 30 of them calling AFL football on network television \u2013 Dennis Cometti himself is tapping out.     Dennis Cometti interviews Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson before an AFL game in 2014. Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images    \u2018You can go back to the place but not the time\u2019 To fully understand Dennis Cometti you need to start with family. To do that you have to begin with the lowlight of Cometti\u2019s life: the sudden death in 1969 of his father James, the son of working class Italian migrant Giovanni, who travelled to Australia in 1909 from Tirano in the Northern Italian Alps and walked 800km through blistering sun from Perth to find backbreaking work and a new life in the harsh, dust-swept terrain of the Meekatharra goldfields. When James Cometti collapsed on a Perth street and died of a heart attack his 18-year-old son and only child was busy training with WAFL team West Perth. Dennis was by that point a teen sensation. The winter before he\u2019d kicked 60 goals and played alongside the club\u2019s legendary captain-coach Graham \u201cPolly\u201d Farmer in a league semi-final.  Expectations for Cometti\u2019s fledgling football career were lofty, and the father-son bond shared by James and Dennis had been strengthened by the game. It was James Cometti who passed on so many of the fundamentals that would later appear in his son\u2019s oft-quoted commentary. Their conversations, and all the long afternoons spent sitting side-by-side at the footy had become a roadmap for Dennis Cometti\u2019s understanding of the game. The day before James Cometti died, he and his son had what seemed at the time a trivial argument. Dennis returned home late from a night on the town \u2013 not the commitment to his burgeoning sports career his father expected of him. Their disagreement was not a screaming match and there were no histrionics, just disappointed silence. What they didn\u2019t know was that they\u2019d never speak again.    Related: 'It still feels close': Vin Catoggio on grand final heartbreak and finding peace | Russell Jackson    \u201cIt lingered on until the next day and I didn\u2019t see him in the morning and he passed away that afternoon,\u201d Cometti tells me as we look back on his life. \u201cI always felt that was a terrible thing to have happened because the relationship was so close. I was an only child and he was more a mate than he was my Dad, and just a really good bloke. I felt that I\u2019d let the team down a little bit by doing that.\u201d The manner in which Cometti learned of his father\u2019s death has always stuck with him, too. Razzed onto the training track by West Perth players, a young police constable accommodated his nerves by laughing at the gibes as he approached the lanky young spearhead. It was a misleading portent. Guided to the sidelines, Cometti was bluntly presented with the news: \u201cBy the way, your dad is dead.\u201d Shocked, he left the ground and had to identify the body to spare his mother Dulcie the task.  After his father\u2019s death Cometti drifted from footy, withdrawing into himself and pushing the game away. Meanwhile, the gravitational pull of his alternative life as a rookie FM radio disc jockey was proving strong, so he only half-heartedly committed himself to West Perth and wouldn\u2019t return to the fold properly until well over a decade later, in a middling three-year stint as coach. \u201cWith my Dad not there, because we\u2019d really had an adventure together with footy from when I was about 11 and we\u2019d had a lot of fun with it, I think I was able to drift a lot more readily,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cHad he been there I\u2019m sure he would have pulled me into line. I respected him greatly and I would have felt that I was letting him down. When he\u2019d gone I let my standards slip because he wasn\u2019t there to safeguard my standards.\u201d What kind of man did Dennis Cometti become as a result of the events of March 1969? Perhaps it\u2019s best to consider a pair of facts from the life he made following his father\u2019s death. The first is that at some point, adapting the lyrics to an obscure song called Waking Up Alone by 1970s singer-songwriter Paul Williams, Cometti settled upon a revealing credo for his life: \u201cyou can go back to the place but not the time.\u201d The second is that despite the fame and millions of dollars that his career in broadcasting has brought him, Dennis Cometti still lives in the house he grew up in \u2013 Jack and Dulcie Cometti\u2019s family home in Perth. \u2018You know he\u2019s in the room\u2019  When you speak to people who\u2019ve spent a lot of time around Dennis Cometti you encounter a few recurring observations; nobody who has ever worked alongside him has a bad word to say about the guy; his preparation for every broadcast is exhaustive \u2013 whether it\u2019s a NAB Challenge pre-season junket in Dubai or a finals blockbuster \u2013 and that the retiring broadcaster is an irreplaceable talent. Colleagues also talk about his presence, a statesmanlike aura that makes even champion footballers self-conscious in his company. \u201cYou know he\u2019s in the room,\u201d his Triple M and former Channel Seven colleague Michael Roberts says. \u201cAnd when he speaks, people listen.\u201d Cometti is tall, gangly and easy to imagine as his youthful self \u2013 flying high into the backs of defenders for pack marks. His long, crooked nose bends across his face like a crow swooping down from a streetlamp, a Cometti family trait he\u2019s traced back to the old country. His ears are long and droopy, lending him the air of a friendly basset hound. That face, unmistakable to old-timers when he\u2019s out and about, is a type you don\u2019t really see on TV anymore. Cometti is the Toby jug commemorative version of a 1970s newsreader. Most who know him mention Cometti\u2019s unique and occasionally flamboyant dress sense, which would probably sit somewhere between a comfortably unhip veteran rock star and Alan Partridge; carefully pressed denim, sunglasses and leather jackets. Older colleagues remember the youthful era in which the jeans were subbed out for outrageous leather pants. \u201cThey were fashionable leather pants, if leather pants can be fashionable,\u201d laughs Cometti\u2019s former Seven commentary colleague Drew Morphett. \u201cHe was a product of the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll era. You wouldn\u2019t see Jonathan Brown or Jason Dunstall or anybody else going out in leather pants. It became a bit of a signature for him.\u201d         Dennis Cometti quits as West Perth football coach.    When Cometti lobbed at Triple J for an appearance in the late 90s, the station\u2019s staff were delighted to note that the commentary legend not only travelled with a leather man-bag tucked under his arm but that it contained a miniature can of hairspray. Cometti\u2019s never been shy about the haircare routine. Before he goes on air he will confer with make-up artists as to the specific brand they\u2019re using, often carefully applying the finishing touches himself. The Cometti barnet is now almost as iconic as the voice \u2013 a perfectly sculpted helmet of hair. \u201cHe\u2019s rock n roll,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cYou know him in a crowd.\u201d As his retirement heralds the end of an era, Cometti is also one of the few remaining denizens of Australian showbiz whose employers consider worthy of limousine service. He\u2019s only ever been late to a game once, after a cancelled flight to a Sunday fixture in Adelaide, for which he didn\u2019t arrive until quarter time. His Melbourne driver, Raj, has ferried Cometti and his wife Velia around town for years. When a network boss joked that Seven were paying Raj more than some of Cometti\u2019s co-commentators, the broadcasting icon shot back: \u201cWell you should be paying your commentators more.\u201d Co-workers consider a ride in the Cometti limo a bit of thrill, though none can claim an anecdote as colourful as that provided by Seven boundary rider Jude Bolton. \u201cOne day we left Etihad stadium and I jumped in, myself and Dennis with Raj,\u201d Bolton tells me. \u201cI\u2019d eaten something really dodgy at Etihad Stadium during one of the calls and I just turned green. Literally green in the face.\u201d \u201cI started getting the cold sweats and I said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to jump out at the first terminal and I\u2019ll walk to our spot.\u2019 And Dennis said, \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t do it in Raj\u2019s car.\u2019 So I ended up having to get out of the car and he\u2019s jumped out with me and he\u2019s helped me through it as I\u2019ve just vomited on the side of the road, and he\u2019s handing me water and telling me he hopes I\u2019m alright.\u201d Then, as Bolton gathered his composure, Cometti appraised the scene in signature style: \u201cCentimetre perfect.\u201d \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Bolton laughs. \u201cJust one of my highlights along the way.\u201d Cometti\u2019s rock star transport arrangements also featured prominently in his colleague Matthew Richardson\u2019s first day in broadcasting, a story that also highlights the fastidiousness of Cometti\u2019s preparation. \u201cI remember rocking up to my first game at Subiaco,\u201d Richardson tells me. \u201cI had a coffee with him the day before. I remember being told to make sure I did my homework, so I had three or four pages of notes and I thought I was going pretty well.\u201d \u201cI pulled up in the old yellow cab there outside the gate at Subiaco feeling pretty good about things, but there was a big black limousine in front of me and out jumped Dennis Cometti. He\u2019s always got the sunglasses on and looks immaculate. He\u2019s a very cool-looking man. And here I am with my four pages of A4 notes and he gets out of this black limo with his massive briefcase of notes and immediately I just thought to myself, \u2018Gee I\u2019ve got a long way to go\u2019.\u201d Yet Cometti doesn\u2019t sweat football 24/7, and rarely seeks conversation about the game when he\u2019s off the clock. Richardson says they normally chat about music, pop culture and news. When I speak to Cometti myself we talk at length about gonzo journalism, The Carpenters, various JFK assassination conspiracies and his aborted documentary on the latter, which he\u2019d started tackling in his final year at the ABC. Cometti has diverse reading tastes and a lot of time to indulge them on long-haul flights between Perth and the east coast, on which most colleagues think he also dreams up many of his signature commentary quips. His favourite writers are Hunter S Thompson and PJ O\u2019Rourke, and he revisits Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas every year. It\u2019s rarely noted, but Cometti has been for most of his career a prolific writer himself \u2013 not just his fastidious pre-broadcast notes and Rodney Dangerfieldesque one-liners but newspaper, magazine and online columns, plus books.    Related: Tom Wills grave restoration project reveals football's heart, soul and history    If he\u2019s given to invoking the past, with his nods to The Easybeats and Big Bob Johnson, Cometti might also be the least sentimental romantic in the business. He fulfilled radio obligations on the night his father died and read Perth TV news the night his mother passed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me a cold person,\u201d he once said. \u201cBut what it does, it probably understands that life and the job run side by side.\u201d Cometti also missed the births of both his daughter Ricki and his son Mark due to work commitments. Mark, now a professional wrestler, was born as his Dad called a Sheffield Shield cricket match (\u201cWe named him Mark, because you\u2019ve never heard of a kid named handpass or kick,\u201d Cometti told listeners). He is avowedly apolitical in his broadcasting, an approach that has had the unintended consequence of courting trouble at times. He was on the mic when Sydney Swans great Adam Goodes performed his famous war dance towards Carlton fans in 2015, and drew stinging criticism for suggesting that he wouldn\u2019t have done it himself before claiming that it wasn\u2019t in Goodes\u2019 best interests either, but he has paused to consider the incident since. \u201cThere was nothing sinister in it,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood what that was all about. It was certainly going to make him the centre of attention in perhaps a difficult way for him, and it turned out to be that way, although I think in the end he got more support than opposition and that was a good thing.\u201d     Dennis Cometti was criticised for his reaction to a war dance performed by AFL legend Adam Goodes against West Coast in 2015. Photograph: Tony Mcdonough/AAP    \u201cI think I said at the time that I wouldn\u2019t have done that, probably at the time not fully understanding what was involved. I didn\u2019t think it was as significant as it perhaps played out to be. But that\u2019s the problem with live television sometimes. It was the opposition cheer squad, so I thought it was provocative in that way, but it was one of those situations looking back that I probably should have bitten my lip.\u201d The question of keeping schtum on his own views is a recurring theme for Cometti, who prefers to remain a neutral observer. \u201cI just don\u2019t think sporting commentary is the place for them, to be honest. That\u2019s just a personal view,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a forum. The audience is certainly widespread in its political views and its views on most things in live in general, so to go too deeply or too far down that track probably does the broadcaster no good, the organisation he represents no good.\u201d To understand Cometti\u2019s reticence on loaded issues like gender and race, and their intersection with sport, it possibly pays to acknowledge the two people who most obviously influenced his early philosophies in life: his mother Dulcie, who was an aspiring novelist when she met Cometti\u2019s father, and his Aunt Esme Fletcher, who opened Western Australia\u2019s first child daycare centre and also a women\u2019s refuge. The strength of the women in his family had an impact on his outlook in life. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that Esme and my mother were feminists, perhaps before feminists were invented,\u201d Cometti once told SBS. \u201cWhat do I think about it? Well I think they were both admirable people. I mean, I agree with what they were on about, there\u2019s no question about that. Sometimes, it needs to be said, they saw men as the enemy and as a young man in that environment you needed to be careful.\u201d \u201cMost of what I have I owe to them ... a lot to be thankful for.\u201d \u2018Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos\u2019 What they say about Dennis Cometti\u2019s swotting before games is true: for as long as he\u2019s been calling football on TV he\u2019s spent 15-20 hours per week watching game tapes in a room dedicated to the task. Sometimes he sits and makes notes, studying patterns of play or doing reconnaissance on new players. Other times he does a workout as he watches, chugging away on an exercise bike or the treadmill set up in front of the screen.  Not only does this habitual process enhance his knowledge of form, tactics and precisely what he can expect from the games he\u2019ll be calling, it pays practical dividends, enabling him to nail the basics like correctly identifying players, a fundamental component of broadcasting expertise in which he often puts younger colleagues in the shade. \u201cSometimes a bloke runs straight at you and you can\u2019t see a number,\u201d notes Drew Morphett. \u201cYou know he\u2019s got blonde hair and bandy legs or something like that, but you think \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019 if he\u2019s playing game number five or something, but Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos. Dennis is fantastic at that.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long and his preparation is just second to none,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThe amount of work he puts into each game is probably the thing I noticed right from the start and probably something you take away \u2013 that someone who has been doing it as long as him but was still putting in as much time as anyone on the preparation. I guess that\u2019s what makes him so good.\u201d   Related: Bulldogs faithful pray for one more AFL miracle to end the wandering | Craig Little    However Cometti\u2019s quest for knowledge doesn\u2019t extend to fraternising with players or getting to know them on a personal level. \u201cCertainly I try to avoid planes with teams on them,\u201d he tells me. \u201cObviously there\u2019s not many planes to Adelaide, so you get what you get. I get on well with the teams but there\u2019s so much small talk and you sort of get tired of that.\u201d Sometimes Cometti has taken that separation of duties to a level that amuses colleagues. Morphett remembers waiting for him at Adelaide airport before a Crows game against West Coast. Cometti arrived on the same flight as Eagles players but went missing when Morphett was trying to find him at the baggage carousel. \u201cI\u2019m thinking \u2018where the hell is Cometti?\u2019\u201d he remembers. \u201cAll of a sudden he appears out of the dunny after half an hour. I said \u2018where have you been?\u2019. He says \u2018I don\u2019t like talking to the players. You\u2019re bumping into them all the time\u2019.\u201d \u201cHe flies by his own rules a little bit.\u201d \u2018Spinning the platters that matter\u2019 It\u2019s impossible to see that an AFL broadcasting talent of Dennis Cometti\u2019s versatility and widespread appeal will emerge from the present media landscape, and now probably unfair to expect it. That\u2019s partly because the culture and times from which Cometti sprang \u2013 the Fleetwood Mac double shots, vaudeville wisecracks and unapologetic schmaltz of 1960s FM radio \u2013 no longer exists.  Neither does the regimented ABC of Cometti\u2019s 14-year stint running from 1973 to 1986. On FM radio Cometti found his inner court jester. From the national broadcaster\u2019s Perth offices on Adelaide Terrace, he painstakingly learned his trade as a broadcast journalist from some of the best teachers and practitioners the country has ever produced. At the ABC there were standards to be maintained and structure to be adhered to and a proper way of doing everything; in cricket, batsmen were always named before bowlers.  Cometti\u2019s first foray into radio was spinning the platters that mattered for Perth station 6KY, which in the late-60s battled head-to-head with 6PR for the loyalties of Perth\u2019s Top 40 radio listeners. In those formative years there was no rulebook and no internet resources to crib his style from, so Cometti imported cumbersome reel-to-reel tapes of America\u2019s best rock DJs and studied them for hours once they\u2019d finished their six-month sea freight journey to Perth.      A 1980s promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti. Photograph: Seven Network    Cometti\u2019s first proper radio gig, in mid-1968, fell into place when an old school friend forwarded his \u201cless than sophisticated audition tape\u201d to veteran 6KY announcer Alan Robertson, who in turn got it to the station\u2019s program director John Lehman. The early days were a bit of a lark but not always smooth-sailing. In one gaffe, Cometti mispronounced a live-read ad for an incense boutique, which he described as \u201cspecialising in incest\u201d. For Cometti, each weekend brought the chance to run out onto football grounds alongside Polly Farmer and during the week he was not only lost in music, but in love. In his first summer of broadcasting he also met Velia, who he would marry. But if Robertson taught Cometti the fundamentals of preparing for a broadcast, and instilled in him the idea that he couldn\u2019t just fly by the seat of his pants, he also might have mentioned that nobody in broadcasting is invincible. Between Cometti\u2019s 6KY debut in 1968 and his move to the ABC in 1973, his CV \u201cread like a greyhound bus schedule.\u201d No job was safe. In 1971 a lack of opportunities in Perth sent him to Melbourne, where he balanced an oddball football comeback in the reserves at Ted Whitten-coached Footscray with the weekday night shift and Sundays on 3DB, Victoria\u2019s home of footy, racing and Top 40 hits. For the day job he\u2019d leave training early and jump on the 6:15 to Flinders street. \u201cMr Part-time,\u201d Whitten would call him. Seven or eight reserves games and his best-paid year in radio behind him, he was back in Western Australia. The sidestep into sports broadcasting didn\u2019t come until \u201873 and in unexpected circumstances: a late call-up to play second fiddle to 3KZ footy stalwart Ian Major for the Victoria-WA state game at Subiaco. Soon he was regularly calling games with WA broadcasting star Oliver Drake-Brockman (\u201cOliver could make dogs weep,\u201d Cometti once said).  ABC program director Jim Fitzmaurice came after him not long after, with a view to the young gun calling sport full-time. Given the tumult of Cometti\u2019s previous five years the security appealed. \u201cWe were middle class and I was an only child and my mother wasn\u2019t working, so there was, if you like, a realisation that I needed to be careful with my next step,\u201d Cometti tells me. In the following 14 years at Aunty, Cometti refined the impeccable broadcasting habits that would form the basis of his calling style over the next four decades. At the ABC\u2019s Perth headquarters he shared a tiny office with fellow newcomer Drew Morphett. \u201cIt was 12 feet by 20 feet or something like that,\u201d remembers Morphett. \u201cWe lived in each other\u2019s pockets early on.\u201d Cometti was an instant hit. Morphett jokes that having slaved away trying to climb the ladder himself, he was immediately leapfrogged by his new colleague, and was told by Fitzmaurice to work around Cometti\u2019s Sunday league football coaching commitments. \u201cHe was always the favoured son,\u201d Morphett laughs. \u201cHe had it over me right from the word go.\u201d Experienced help was always at hand. \u201cOur superiors were broadcasters,\u201d Morphett says, pointing to Fitzmaurice as a key mentor. \u201cHe was a legendary broadcaster. When Jim tapped you on the shoulder and told you you were ready to go, it was coming from a good source.\u201d \u201cWe were all taught the basics of broadcasting. He (Cometti) didn\u2019t need much coaching to do football broadcasting because he was a coach and a former player. He got a very early nod to be the ABC\u2019s Test cricket caller on radio. I thought at the time it was a very quick elevation.\u201d Though it was an odd fit at first, Cometti rose to the challenge of calling cricket beside Alan McGilvray and former Test captain Lindsay Hassett during the 1974-75 Ashes, starting a lifetime habit of over-preparing to avoid any chance of being caught short. Each morning he\u2019d arrive with a long list of headlines to work from; weather, the toss, the batting order and other stories of the day. \u201cHe did it almost by indexing,\u201d says Morphett, \u201cso that if he ran out of something to say, he went to the next topic.\u201d To this day, Cometti still tenses up at the start of broadcasts the same way he did back then and delivering the opening monologue to camera has always been something of an ordeal. \u201cEven this year, I think he still probably gets nervous,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThat\u2019s probably what makes him so good. He\u2019s not taking any call for granted no matter where it is, whether it\u2019s a big game or a final, or maybe a game between teams on the bottom of the ladder.\u201d   Related: From the Footy Almanac vault: Barry Dickins remembers mud    As late as the early 90s, Cometti remained so concerned about nailing his opening lines that he instituted his own homespun autocue. \u201cDennis set up this little system,\u201d says Morphett, who adds that Cometti would be mortified by people knowing. \u201cHe had a piece of dowel. He put it across the lens of the camera and he had two pieces of paper left and right of the lens, and on them he\u2019d have headlines.\u201d \u201cThe first line would be \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019. Second line would be \u2018West Coast v Richmond\u2019. Third line would be, \u2018fighting for a finals berth\u2019 or whatever. I used to say, \u2018why have you got to write down \u2013 \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019? It was a piece of wood across the lens of the camera and two foolscap bits of paper. This was just his way of getting under way without making any blues right from the start.\u201d Yet no amount of preparation could prevent the chaos around him. When a nervous Cometti took the chair for his first ever stint at the mic in a Test, during the Perth Test of 1974, he was mortified when he turned and realised his expert offsider Hassett had picked up his trademark pipe and wandered off into the distance for a smoke. \u201cIn many ways that day was helpful,\u201d Cometti later noted, \u201cif for no other reason than to illustrate how isolated and vulnerable broadcasters could be.\u201d Cometti himself has grown into a thoughtful and generous colleague, ever-conscious of injecting his less experienced co-workers into the broadcast and putting them at ease. Before Richardson\u2019s debut broadcast as a Seven boundary rider and knowing he was nervous, Cometti and McAvaney walked down to the fence together and reassured him that he\u2019d be fine. \u201cRight from day one I was made to feel welcome by Dennis,\u201d Richardson says. That extends to the call itself. \u201cHe always throws down to you in a great way and brings you into the conversation with a perfect little lead-in,\u201d says Seven newcomer Jude Bolton. \u201cThat\u2019s made my transition as easy as possible.\u201d         Dennis Cometti calls the 2011 Meredith Gift.    Such grace and care for co-callers also helps Cometti\u2019s own image, says his long-time colleague Michael Roberts. \u201cHe\u2019s looking after you, looking after the brand, and looking after himself,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThere\u2019s blokes that I work with that just get their kicks out of putting you on the spot and getting a laugh out of seeing you stuff up. But Dennis is all about looking after you. He\u2019s a team player. He looks after his team-mates and he makes sure that the brand is winning.\u201d At the ABC Cometti was actually being groomed as McGilvray\u2019s long-term replacement, though his bosses might have known that jig was up when he knocked back a chance to accompany the cricket broadcasting great on an Ashes tour, preferring instead to focus his energies on the WAFL season at hand. It\u2019s rarely mentioned these days but Cometti\u2019s cricket broadcasting days spanned from that fiery 1974-75 Ashes through the World Series schism and the troubled early seasons of the Border years, and he\u2019d also return for Seven in the 1990s, calling Australia\u2019s 1997 tour of South Africa.         Dennis Cometti calling Australia\u2019s 1997 Test tour of South Africa.    Cricket was also the scene of one of his rare tantrums. Ray \u201cSlug\u201d Jordon once recalled an ABC call of a New Zealand-Sri Lanka one-day international at Bellerive Oval, for which the ABC was provided 30-minute shifts each from the travelling Nine TV broadcast team \u2013 Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry, Tony Greig and Ian Chappell. To get into the broadcast area both sets of callers needed to ascend a narrow and amateurishly-constructed piece of scaffolding, which gave the operation the feel of a tree house. Chairs, desks and broadcast equipment had been lifted into position with a rugged pulley system. Cometti started to baulk. Come the morning shift, Benaud hit his head on the scaffolding as he climbed a rickety ladder.  \u201cThat was the end for Richie,\u201d said Jordon, \u201cand Dennis spat the dummy in sympathy. Richie retreated to the luxury of the channel Nine box while Dennis headed back to his hotel room and locked the door.\u201d By 1987, when Cometti departed the ABC to star in Broadcom\u2019s VFL football coverage en route to Seven, his days of schlepping around on a public service budget were done. We forget it now, because his name is synonymous with AFL, but Cometti has been a versatile caller in the past two decades, an adaptability that came from those days at the ABC. His calls of Kieren Perkins\u2019 1500m gold medal and Susie O\u2019Neill\u2019s triumphs at Atlanta \u201896 are classics in the annals of Australian sports broadcasting. As ever, success came from preparation. \u201cHe just did the homework and worked hard at it,\u201d Morphett says. \u201cHe would just find a little corner in the broadcast centre and just be poring over notes and preparing himself perfectly.\u201d  \u2018He was a very quiet man\u2019 If Dennis Cometti will be remembered best for his iconic one-liners, what will be missed most is his voice \u2013 a deep and humming baritone that croons its way through football matches. When Dennis Cometti calls upon his entire vocal range and enunciates it\u2019s as though the words are echoing up from the bottom of a French oak wine barrel. Cometti is not really sure where that voice came from, but says there\u2019s some similarities with his father\u2019s. \u201cHe was a very quiet man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say he didn\u2019t have a deep, manly voice, my father. It was hardly ever raised in anger or raised in any way. It was just a different time.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t like me getting too loud at the footy and I suppose that tempered my view in terms of when I do the broadcast now. I certainly don\u2019t have any skin in the game. I don\u2019t barrack for teams. As a result I find that helpful. He sort of imbued me with that in the early days when I\u2019d get a little too vocal.\u201d   Related: AFL and NRL grand final entertainment: the worse it is, the better it is | Russell Jackson    But the Cometti pipes have been passed on his professional wrestler son Mark, who could prove one of football\u2019s great father-son selections if things go right. \u201cHe\u2019s got a better voice than I have,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI think he\u2019s flirting with the idea of going into broadcasting and I\u2019m trying to help him a little bit at the moment, because he\u2019s back nursing a shoulder injury in Perth. He was supposed to be my superannuation package when I sent him away but now he\u2019s back here.\u201d \u2018You can have a good time at the footy\u2019 As he crosses the finishing line on a 49-year broadcasting career, Cometti is by such a margin the numero uno of AFL broadcasting that you forget it wasn\u2019t always so. In the late 80s and early 90s there was a perception on the eastern seaboard, quite unfair, that he favoured his home-state West Coast Eagles. At times Seven overlooked him for key finals, and he certainly wasn\u2019t the face of the network\u2019s coverage. He first moved to Seven in 1988, the season after his shambolic and strange year with Broadcom, joining the likes of McAvaney, Morphett, Sandy Roberts, Don Scott and Peter Landy as household names in AFL states. Though Seven still has the strongest claim on Cometti, it\u2019s also true to say that through the 1990s, neither they nor the staid nature of sports broadcasting in Australia allowed him to emerge as the universally-loved caller we now know. \u201cThere was no overt \u2018you can\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d Cometti says of that period, \u201cit was just that you understood the environment you were in, and it was very hardcore football.\u201d      A promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti. Photograph: Seven Network    It was out of the great TV rights war of 2001 that Cometti was able to find a new gear and unprecedented levels of popularity where so many other callers of his generation faded from view or disappeared from our TV screens entirely. Drafted in alongside Eddie McGuire as a star attraction of the Channel Nine team, he spent six years reinventing himself as the most consistently entertaining caller in the business, an evolution in his calling style that Nine encouraged. Cometti likens the transition period to a rediscovery of his lazy late-1960s days out at the footy, when he\u2019d try to make his friends laugh on the banks of Leederville oval in Perth, whose amphitheater design allowed wisecracks to ring out across the ground. \u201cYou can have a good time at the footy,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to the detriment of the game and not pushing yourself up, but a few lines here or there in the course of the afternoon \u2013 particularly if the game is a little dull \u2013 doesn\u2019t add up to much time compared to the game itself.\u201d \u201cMy recollections of the footy was that you went and had a good time and you made a lot of smart alec remarks about the players and whatever else might be happening. It\u2019s probably an insight into my personality that I do like to do that. I probably am a bit of a smart alec, which may have come from being in the disc jockey business and trying to be funny. I had no trouble just trying to be me. I felt that sometimes I pulled back from that in the early days at Seven.\u201d  By 2008, when Nine lost the rights and Cometti returned to Seven, the network\u2019s bosses were more than happy to let him do his own thing. Entertainment was back on the agenda. \u201cYou can\u2019t be making light of what\u2019s happening too often,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting line to walk, and you can\u2019t be disrespectful. The contest is the thing. It\u2019s everything.\u201d But what Cometti has learned across his career is that a special kind of relationship develops between commentator and listener, one that needs to be tended to. Some callers, he says, prefer to keep the audience at a distance and not reveal much of themselves, but for Cometti it\u2019s been a gradual process of letting people in. He wants his fans to know him, to see who he is. \u201cSometimes you can watch a bloke on TV for 20 or 25 years and really be none the wiser about who he is,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not a criticism. That is a choice that someone has made and they can do it very well. I\u2019m of the opinion, if I watch and invest so much time in somebody or something, I would like at the end of that to know someone I\u2019ve spent all that time with a little better.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s how I view a relationship: you\u2019ve gotta let people in. Some people say it\u2019s not a relationship, but I think it is. For me, that was important. To have people say \u2018he seems like a reasonable bloke\u2019. When I finished I wanted to be better known to the people I was broadcasting to, especially if they\u2019d put that time and energy into listening to me. I owe them a debt of gratitude.\u201d \u2018We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket\u2019 Of course Dennis Cometti\u2019s disappearance from our TV screens means not only the loss of a singular broadcasting talent but also spells the end of his enduring double-act with McAvaney, with whom he\u2019s formed a professional dynamic that will be impossible for Seven to replicate. Dennis and Bruce. Bruce and Dennis. They\u2019re like an old couple, right down to the biscuits McAvaney brings to every game, always from the same shop on Flinders lane. Their longstanding rapport has been possible due to immense mutual respect and the kind of casual comfort among each other that allows them to sit alone at opposite ends of hotel dining rooms without acknowledging one another, lest they stifle their on-air chemistry. \u201cWe\u2019re such good friends we can tell each other to bugger off,\u201d Cometti once said. Another key to their partnership, he thinks, is that they never compete against each other for attention. Each caller knows his role. When I talk to Cometti about the closeness of that bond, I mention a theory floated by ESPN\u2019s Tony Kornheiser about his on-air partnership with his PTI co-host and friend Michael Wilbon; that the secret to the successful on-air partnership is like the old joke made by the Wimbledon groundskeepers when they\u2019re asked how they keep the courts so green: you just start with 5000 years of rain. Cometti laughs. He and Bruce have had their 5000 years of rain, and they\u2019re sad that it\u2019s coming to an end. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a harsh word,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends. We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket. It\u2019s been a wonderful relationship. I\u2019ve got the utmost respect for him.\u201d For those around them, it\u2019s also the end of an era. \u201cAs long as I can remember, it\u2019s been \u2018Bruce and Dennis\u2019, you know? You can\u2019t replace that overnight,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s irreplaceable really. Not many Dennis Cometti\u2019s come along in broadcasting. I guess it\u2019s like a superstar footballer. They only come along once in a while. I guess it\u2019s going to be the same with Dennis and that\u2019s the challenge \u2013 finding that chemistry up in the box when he does retire.\u201d The only time Cometti seems anything other than comfortable in his decision to call it quits is when he discusses Bruce. \u201cHe is certainly the thing I will miss most from broadcasting footy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure it for the rest of my life. I envy my replacement in that regard.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019 As his final game approaches, Cometti is at pains to point something out: he\u2019s not quitting football broadcasting per se, he is just retiring from travelling. \u201cThe weekend before last I had three games in three states,\u201d he says. \u201cNow a man of my advancing years can\u2019t be doing that too often.\u201d  \u201cI just feel that now I\u2019m not enjoying it because of the travel. Once I\u2019m at the ground and being with Bruce and watching the game, and Hamish and Basil on Sundays, it\u2019s terrific. It\u2019s really good fun. I\u2019ve met some great people along the way, and that\u2019s all good and well, but at the same time you think \u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019. At my age it\u2019s probably not the time to be taking the punishment.\u201d It\u2019s been mooted that he wouldn\u2019t mind calling some local games. \u201cI could wander down to the WAFL and just sit in on the telecast,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d like that. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, because not many go to the WAFL, but that\u2019s where my youth is. I\u2019m sort of mired back in the 50s and 60s\u201d. But he\u2019s not so keen on learning nine new team lists and says \u201cit\u2019s all up in the air\u201d for now.  \u201cI could see myself being an \u2018expert\u2019 in inverted commas,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs a failed coach I\u2019m perfectly credentialed to do that.\u201d   Related: The Joy of Six: AFL player-coach feuds | Russell Jackson    Either way Cometti will continue his association with Seven, doing some blogging and filling the odd gap for Western Australian events. His mood after the grand final, he thinks, will depend on how his call has gone. \u201cIf I thought the broadcast has gone well, I\u2019ll probably have a little elation after the grand final, you know, that you got through.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019ve made the choice and I\u2019m comfortable with it. I\u2019m looking forward to the game, but I\u2019m also looking forward to the Sunday night after it when I go out for dinner. I dunno what that tells me. I\u2019ll be happy with the decision.\u201d Cometti is also happy for fans to remember him at his peak, rather than hanging on too long. \u201cA lot of people are talking to me now, saying that it might be a Johnny Farnham retirement,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI use the analogy that sooner or later, if you stay out long enough, forget about Johnny Farnham, you become Meatloaf. So we don\u2019t want to do that either.\u201d And that is more or less that. Though not quite. Just when I think I\u2019m done sifting over Dennis Cometti\u2019s life in broadcasting and finished speaking to the people who\u2019ve sat beside him along the way, a phone call arrives one morning from the man himself. Our conversation has stirred a memory in him and his effort to call back and share it seems revealing of his professional generosity. At this stage Greater Western Sydney are still a decent shot of making their first AFL grand final, and with that in mind Dennis has remembered an anecdote he thinks would work perfectly. In 2011, before the Giants had played a single league game, Cometti was receiving a tour of their training facilities when then-assistant coach Mark Williams roped him into giving the fledgling club\u2019s young players a pep talk.  He hadn\u2019t thought of it again until earlier this season when he bumped into Williams again, and the coach thought Cometti would get a kick out of knowing that the Giants had picked a choice phrase out of the motivational spiel and had it plastered over their locker room walls: \u201cYou can go back to the place but not to the time.\u201d \u2022 Support our journalism with a monthly or one-off contribution to Guardian Australia", "title": "Like a cork in the ocean: Dennis Cometti bobs up to call his final AFL game | Russell Jackson", "sentences": ["\u2018You know he\u2019s in the room\u2019  When you speak to people who\u2019ve spent a lot of time around Dennis Cometti you encounter a few recurring observations; nobody who has ever worked alongside him has a bad word to say about the guy; his preparation for every broadcast is exhaustive \u2013 whether it\u2019s a NAB Challenge pre-season junket in Dubai or a finals blockbuster \u2013 and that the retiring broadcaster is an irreplaceable talent."], "publicationDate": "2016-09-27T20:30:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/28/ps-vr-deus-ex-mario-metroid", "tags": ["Culture", "Games", "PlayStation 4", "Virtual reality", "Super Mario", "Pok\u00e9mon Go", "Nintendo", "PlayStation", "Sony", "Technology"], "article": "If you did your growing up in the 20th century, the chances are your youthful predictions for 2016 would have involved colonies on the Moon, flying cars and friendly, subservient robots.

But this month even that small piece of future-certainty looked questionable with news that, in the US, sales of Oculus Rift (\u00a3549), the Facebook-owned technology that re-sparked interest in VR, and HTC Vive (\u00a3799), its technically superior rival, had both ground to a halt.

Li, a director of international project marketing for the US real estate giant CBRE, is predicting a surge of eastern investment in British homes over the next decade, as increasingly affluent Chinese investors acquire a taste for international property.  \u201cI think it is just beginning,\u201d says Li, of the amount of money pouring into property around the world from mainland China. \u201cYou do the figures: China has a population of 1.4 billion. If you target only 1% of China\u2019s population, that\u2019s 14 million people \u2013 so it\u2019s already almost two Londons.\u201d Sitting in his office overlooking Hong Kong\u2019s skyscraper-dotted Victoria Harbour, Li estimates that just 3% of potential Chinese investors in overseas property have so far been found \u2013 meaning a virtually untapped goldmine lies over the border in mainland China. \u201cChina is a big market, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cThey are getting wealthier and wealthier.\u201d     Victor Li in his Hong Kong office    Rich Hong Kong investors have been ploughing money into British bricks and mortar for decades, snapping up off-plan apartments at weekly property fairs that can then be rented, flipped, held as investments or used as second homes. \u201cI have one [London property] in Canary Wharf, one in City Island, one in Wembley Park, one in Elephant and Castle,\u201d said one investor matter-of-factly at a recent expo in Hong Kong\u2019s chic Mandarin Oriental Hotel, as he eyed a new development near the Thames Barrier in E16. But many real-estate agents and property experts in east Asia believe a new wave of investment is just getting under way, as mainland investors develop a taste for international real estate, including postcodes up and down the UK. \u201cOur thesis \u2013 and this is supported by quite a lot of evidence \u2013 is that in many ways the international Chinese investment journey is probably just starting,\u201d says Charles Pittar, chief executive of Juwai.com, a website that aims to pair mainland buyers with property developers in places such as Australia, the US and the UK. Pittar\u2019s company, which lists 2.5 million properties and calls itself China\u2019s largest international real-estate website, estimates that in 2014, Chinese outbound investment into residential and commercial property was more than $50bn (\u00a338bn).  \u201cI guess the key is: what is it going to become?\u201d Pittar says. \u201cOur view is that \u2026 it could be growing to somewhere around $200bn [annually] over the next 10 years.\u201d And Britain, despite its decision to leave the EU, is expected to be one of the key focuses, he adds. \u201cThe UK market, particularly post-Brexit, is really picking up.\u201d Pittar traces mainland China\u2019s hunger for overseas property back to the turn of the century, just before China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organisation signalled the latest phase of its integration into the global economy. But the outflow of money has gathered pace over the past decade, and is set to grow further as middle-class investors from second- and third-tier cities get in on the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a big market now, but it is likely to be anywhere from two to four times the size in 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d Pittar says. \u201cThe exciting thing about China is that there are 168 cities with more than a million people. So this is just such a huge market.\u201d     A poster for the new Royal Wharf development in London from a recent property show in Hong Kong. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Li, who specialises in London properties worth up to \u00a34m, concurs with the notion that Brexit is helping to accelerate the boom in interest in the UK: \u201cSome of my clients at the beginning of the year, they said: \u2018OK Victor, let\u2019s wait, wait, wait.\u2019 And then, after they found out about Brexit and [the] sterling came down more than 10%, I got more calls \u2013 they want to go back into the market. It\u2019s lots of saving,\u201d he says with a grin. According to Pittar, Chinese who buy property overseas have four main motivations: investment, lifestyle, emigration and education. Many are looking for a foothold in the UK, where they hope their children will go on to study.\u201cSome people are buying for their family to use it,\u201d says Li, \u201csome are buying to diversify, some are buying because they want to own a property for investment \u2013 and some people are buying for prestige, to say: \u2018I own a piece of property in London.\u2019\u201d Crucially, he says, London is also seen as a secure place to store money that investors want to move out of China, to guard against the devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan. \u201cPeople in mainland China, they want to get their money out ... They believe that money out of China is safe money. And London is a safe-haven to park that money.\u201d The 50-year-old property salesman made his first foray into mainland China in 2001, pitching a slice of Lambeth\u2019s St George Wharf to would-be investors at a five-star hotel on Shanghai\u2019s answer to Oxford Street.    People in mainland Chin\u200b\u200ba, they want to get their money out. London is a safe-haven  Victor Li     Over the past year alone, Li has made almost 20 such trips, jetting out from his base in Hong Kong to cities including Guangzhou, Chongqing and Chengdu to meet with cash-flush Chinese buyers. \u201cThis one is Macau \u2026 This one is Shanghai,\u201d he says, flicking through photographs on his smartphone of recent seminars where he advertised luxury London developments such as Clipper Wharf in E1 and Carrara Tower on City Road. Li says some mainland investors agree to buy apartments on the spot. \u201cIf they are interested, they reserve the unit \u2013 they just use a credit card. They have Union Pay, Mastercard or Visa: \u00a35,000.\u201d Many of his mainland investors are real-estate tycoons who have made a fortune from their country\u2019s economic boom, and now \u201cjust want to take the profits, cash out and move some of their wealth overseas\u201d.  But Pittar believes the story of ordinary, middle-class investors is more significant than that of China\u2019s globe-trotting, Ferrari-driving elite. \u201cWhat we read in the newspapers is always about the very wealthy Chinese who come and buy a \u00a35m, \u00a310m, \u00a315m property. But the middle class is key. How big is the middle class? It could be 120 million. We tend to think it\u2019s probably closer to 150 million. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve got somewhere to live in China, the reality is that the domestic market is quite expensive, so that\u2019s why they are looking more for international opportunities. Like anyone who wants to preserve their wealth, diversification is important.\u201d     London\u2019s Nine Elms redevelopment: property in the UK capital is seen as both prestigious and secure in China. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian    Predictions that a new wave of investment from mainland China is on the horizon will stir further debate over the measures British politicians might use to protect local home buyers. The anticipated influx of money from mainland China into the UK is set to affect not only London \u2013 historically the focus for much east Asian investment \u2013 but cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, to which more of the investment is now heading. \u201cThose seem to be the hotspots,\u201d says Neil Jensen, the Hong Kong-based regional director for London estate agent Fraser &amp; Co, who promotes developments in the capital to Asian investors.  A particular spotlight has been shining on Manchester since last October, when Chinese president Xi Jinping toured the city to lend his support to George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project during his first state visit to Britain.  Jensen says Fraser &amp; Co, founded in 1995, has traditionally specialised in London properties which it markets internationally through offices in Dubai and Hong Kong. Now, however, he is preparing to offer his clients their first major investment opportunity outside the capital, in a project specifically designed to attract Chinese money. Called \u201cNew Chinatown\u201d \u2013 or Xinhua Bu (New China Wharf) in Mandarin \u2013 the \u00a3200m venture in Liverpool describes itself as \u201cone of the most important and exciting developments in the UK today\u201d and promises to be \u201cone of the UK\u2019s most luxurious and desirable residential destinations\u201d.    You can\u2019t just put up a block of flats in Liverpool and expect people to buy it \u2013 there has to be a story  Neil Jensen     The development\u2019s website boasts: \u201cIt is the burgeoning energy and dynamism of modern China transplanted into the heart of an historic World Heritage City.\u201d Adding: \u201cThis is an historic moment \u2026 This is a unique investment opportunity. \u201cUnderpinning the whole masterplan is the idea and motif of the awakening dragon \u2013 a powerful symbol of China\u2019s resurgence and status as a new global power.\u201d Jensen says improving transport infrastructure in the northwest and relatively low prices meant New Chinatown \u2013 where two-bedroom duplex penthouses are on offer for up to \u00a3546,427 and ordinary one-bedroom flats from \u00a3119,211 \u2013 would be a hit with Chinese investors.  \u201cYou can\u2019t just put up a block of flats in Liverpool and expect people to buy it \u2026 If you want foreign buyers there has to be a story,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cThey\u2019ll probably go quite quickly.\u201d The fringes of London have also come onto the radar of Chinese investors, thanks to Crossrail, a \u00a314.8bn, 73-mile metrolink cutting west to east across the capital, which is set to open in 2018. \u201cMost of your investors 20 or 30 years ago would have been going more towards the bullseye in dartboard terms,\u201d Jensen says, referring to the centre of London. But improved transport links are now drawing foreign investors to places such as Slough, Ilford and Canning Town. \u201cThe commuter area \u2013 anything within a 20-30 minute travel time [of central London] is hot,\u201d says Jonathan Gordon, a director at IP Global, a Hong Kong property investment firm that is promoting projects in Ilford and Croydon and has previously invested in Slough.

Illustration: Fraser &amp; Co    \u201cSlough has got Crossrail going through it so you can get to Bond Street in no time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is those sorts of stories we are interested in as opposed to buying in Bond Street itself.\u201d Crossrail is not the only reason foreign investors are now looking to the outskirts of the capital, though. Investors and industry insiders say stamp duty increases targeting wealthy foreign investors have pushed up the cost of buying more expensive properties in prime locations. That has led many foreign investors to buy a larger number of cheaper properties in more peripheral, suburban areas, says Gordon, where \u201ctransaction costs are lower.\u201d One veteran Hong Kong investor, with a portfolio that includes properties in London, Manchester and Liverpool, explains: \u201cYou buy a large number of properties, but lower-priced ones \u2026 You pay something like \u00a3200,000 or \u00a3250,000, rather than \u00a31m for zone one in Mayfair, places like that.\u201d This new wave of Chinese investors includes people such as Jody Ye, a 30-year-old from Chongqing, a metropolis in south-west China. In July, Ye paid \u00a3200,000 for a flat in Bristol, where she went to university and now lives. She is planning to buy her second UK property. \u201cBuying property back home is too expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cInvesting in the UK is much more cost-efficient.\u201d Bristol is not only \u201ca great place\u201d, but, she adds: \u201cBritish people think Bristol is posh.\u201d      The Hong Kong headquarters of Juwai.com    Fan Feifei, 34, from Xi\u2019an, is another Chinese buy-to-let investor. She is preparing to purchase her third property in Birmingham. \u201cI bought it purely for investment,\u201d she says of her second purchase, a \u00a3135,000 home in B29, which she rents to overseas students. \u201cSince 2014, Chinese people have been rushing to buy houses in the UK,\u201d adds Fan, pointing to high rental yields and stable property prices as key driving factors. \u201cAll of the Chinese people around me are buying houses or have already bought several houses in the UK. I\u2019m the one who has bought the least, with only two.\u201d Song Dongzhe, a third mainland investor, from the north-eastern city of Dalian, bought his first British property \u2013 a three-bedroomed house in Selly Oak, south-west Birmingham \u2013 in 2012 for \u00a3125,000. Earlier this year he bought two more. Song says the UK is \u201cvery attractive to Chinese property investors\u201d, largely because it does not have the high duties that have been introduced in Canada and Australia targeting foreign buyers. High prices in London make it \u201ctoo risky\u201d to buy there, he adds. But \u201cas the UK\u2019s second biggest city, I thought Birmingham was a choice that made sense\u201d. A fourth mainland investor, who declines to be named, says President Xi\u2019s tour of the UK convinced him Britain was the right place to invest his family\u2019s fortune. Property in major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen is now too expensive, the Shanghai investor says, and China\u2019s stock market is \u201cextremely unstable \u2013 so I think it\u2019s a good time to invest in [the] UK.\u201d As well as London, he says he is now looking at opportunities in cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. Underlying discontent Speaking in his Hong Kong office, property promoter Gordon predicts that, as has happened elsewhere in the world, concern over foreign investment in British property will eventually lead to the introduction of measures to protect local buyers. \u201cThere is that underlying discontent in some camps to say: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not on, it\u2019s not fair \u2013 releasing and selling all this property overseas.\u2019  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, going forward, there is some legislation that says a certain percentage of properties have to be sold or marketed locally for a period of time, and then it is fair game overseas [after that].\u201d Australia, currently the second biggest destination for Chinese property investment after the United States, has been cracking down on foreign buyers since last year, after complaints that China\u2019s voracious appetite for property in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne was pricing local buyers out of the market. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous city that returned to Chinese control in 1997, has also been fighting to quell a huge wave of often speculative mainland investment in residential property. In a bid to rein in sky-high prices, authorities in the former colony have rolled out a series of cooling measures in recent years, including tighter lending rules and higher stamp duties.      Hong Kong has been battling a huge wave of investment from mainland China in its residential property. Photograph: Marco Wong/Getty Images    Victoria Allan, an Australian real estate entrepreneur who specialises in leasing and selling property on Hong Kong island, says: \u201cThe price point has moved so high in Hong Kong that it\u2019s hard to buy a house any more for under US$10m that, five or six years ago, you could buy for $5m.\u201d Allan, founder of Habitat Property, says efforts to stem the flow of mainland money into Hong Kong have diverted a significant amount of Chinese investment elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s moved into Australia and the UK; it\u2019s moved into the US. And it has really pushed those markets up as well.\u201d Allan believes that the Hong Kong government pushed back too hard against the influx of mainland money, and advises British policymakers to avoid taking too drastic steps. \u201cI would definitely say: don\u2019t shut it out totally. That was our mistake. I think Hong Kong has approached it too harshly. Why shut the door totally?\u201d By locking mainland Chinese real estate investors out, Allan argues, \u201cthe whole economy suffers, not just the property market. There has to be some kind of balance. We are supposed to be an international city.  \u201cMaybe some tax is applicable,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think there is a way to manage it in a really positive way for everyone. Particularly if that is done in conjunction with town planning and helping direct the investment into towns and city centres that need assistance with good housing. There are great ways to take the investment.\u201d     Buying property back home is too expensive. Investing in the UK is much more cost-efficient  Jody Ye     Jensen also warns against demonising foreign investors, who he says play an essential role in helping developers build new homes. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a world city and not have foreign investment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of schemes going up, but how on earth are they going to fund them?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe banks don\u2019t have the money \u2026 So you\u2019ve got to rely on overseas investment, be it funding by way of people buying them, or by someone saying, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll buy the site and the development and we\u2019ll sell it back to the Brits\u2019.\u201d Li says he recognises the controversy surrounding foreign investment, but shrugs it off as a natural phenomenon: \u201cI think even in Hong Kong we face the same problem. You just can\u2019t avoid it; it\u2019s supply and demand. Everybody wants to live in the best location, right?\u201d But not everyone is convinced Chinese investment in overseas property will continue to soar. Gordon says the scale of future investment will depend on the health of the Chinese economy, and the enthusiasm with which Beijing enforces capital controls limiting how much money individuals can remove from the country. Others believe the uncertainty caused by Brexit will put the brakes on further moves into the UK.  Concerns over the risk involved in some UK developments may also curb enthusiasm for off-plan investment. For months, rumours have been swirling in Hong Kong about major developments that appear to have collapsed after the developer went bust, leaving investors struggling to recoup their money.

Related: Australian family win fight against deportation from Scotland    Gloria Macleod, whose husband Robert grew up in Dingwall, in the Highlands, was refused entry to the UK at Inverness airport on Monday, despite holding a valid visa, and was placed on temporary admission, which expires on Saturday.  The couple\u2019s local MP, Ian Blackford, has written to the immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, asking that the removal order be suspended until he and the family receive a full explanation. Last Tuesday Blackford celebrated with another family of constituents, the Brains, who were granted leave to remain after fighting since April against deportation.  Gloria\u2019s husband, Robert, whom she married in 2003, is a former Royal Regiment of Scotland lance corporal, and their two daughters are both British citizens. The family, who had been living in Dubai where Robert works as a security manager, returned to Dingwall in July, where 11-year-old Siobhan and 10-year-old Meaghan have been enrolled in primary school Although Gloria, an Indian passport holder, was already in possession of a UK C-Visit passport, which is valid for 10 years, the couple decided that she should apply for permanent residence to allow her to remain in Scotland while the girls attended school and Robert continued working in Dubai. Following advice from the visa office in Dubai, acting on behalf of the UK immigration service, that her application had to be made in person, Gloria briefly left the UK to complete her application process.  But when she returned to the UK on Monday she was refused entry. When she pleaded with the authorities that she was due to pick up her children from school that afternoon, she was allowed in on on the condition that she be deported to Dubai on Saturday. The family now faces the prospect of Gloria\u2019s imminent departure, with only Robert\u2019s elderly parents remaining to look after the children. Blackford, who is still awaiting a reply from the Home Office, said: \u201cMrs Macleod followed exactly the instructions given to her by the immigration service and is now being penalised for this. Her visa is still current and has not been violated in any way.

He has a good job in Dubai and it is quite understandable that he wants to continue with this to support his family. \u201cWhat is beyond understanding is the attitude of the Home Office, who are removing a mother from her family, leaving two young girls in the care of elderly and infirm grandparents for no apparent reason.

According to partial tax returns obtained by the New York Times, after the Republican presidential nominee wrote off the disastrous collapse of his Atlantic City casino properties in New Jersey and other business mishaps on his 1995 personal income taxes, he probably didn\u2019t have to pay any income tax until 2014 \u2013 the same year the Trump Taj Mahal casino finally went bankrupt, coincidentally. So, what could federal and local governments do with $916m in Trump Bucks? Rebuild the Trump Taj Mahal The crown jewel in his now defunct casino empire cost about $1bn to build and was described by Trump as \u201cthe eighth wonder of the world\u201d. Trump was briefly Atlantic City\u2019s largest employer. The collapse of its casino economy has left the city on the edge of bankruptcy, and the state is suffering too.           The Trump Taj Mahal is closing: did it make Atlantic City great?    Just about close the budget gap for the whole state of New Jersey In May the budget office of New Jersey\u2019s state legislature announced a $1.1bn shortfall in its budget. The budget \u2013 at a final cost of $34.5bn \u2013 eventually passed, with aid to poor families, towns in financial trouble, and the state\u2019s \u201crainy day fund\u201d dramatically reduced. The cause? Lower than expected income tax revenue. The destruction of Atlantic City could not have helped. Stop the A/C vents in the Northport Veterans Affairs hospital from \u2018spewing grit\u2019 Trump has made much of his support for veterans, but his leaked tax returns show he chose to skip donating to a New Jersey tax-funded scheme aimed at helping former military. That\u2019s a shame. Part of his non-payment could have helped facilities such as Long Island\u2019s Northport 502-bed Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center, where Newsday reported the heating and air conditioning vents began \u201cspewing grit into surgical areas\u201d in February. All five operating rooms at the hospital were closed for months. Phillip Moschitta, the hospital\u2019s director, told Long Island\u2019s News 12 that the vents were 45 years old. Budget shortfalls for VA construction projects across the entire nation are less than two-thirds of Trump\u2019s tax writeoff: $582m. Build the Donald J Trump terminal at a \u2018third world\u2019 US airport When he\u2019s not disparaging Rosie O\u2019Donnell or Alicia Machado, one of Trump\u2019s favorite targets is New York City\u2019s much-maligned LaGuardia airport. Renovating the airport would reportedly cost between $4bn and $5.3bn; Trump\u2019s tax avoidance won\u2019t quite cover the entire bill, but it\u2019s probably enough to get his name on the international terminal.  \u201cOur airports are like from a third world country,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible \u2013 you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land \u2013 we\u2019ve become a third world country.\u201d     New York\u2019s \u2018third world\u2019 airport. Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters    In New Jersey, another place Trump\u2019s taxes might have gone, there\u2019s another of his favorites: Newark Liberty. In 2012 the Port Authority announced a $350m renovation of that airport\u2019s terminal B \u2013 barely one-third of the losses reported on the 1995 form. Close the New Jersey Transit budget gap 20 times over The New Jersey Transit public transportation system, which includes the train that smashed into the historic Hoboken station, killing a 34-year-old woman and injuring 100 others, is in crisis during a $45m budget gap. Trump\u2019s tax writeoff, diminished additionally by help from his pal Chris Christie, could have closed the gap 20 times and still left him with enough change to splurge on Steve Miller\u2019s 38-acre estate. Save the IRS The money could have triaged the staff cuts and early retirements at the agency that polices the payment of taxes that fund all federal public works in the nation. That\u2019s the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which lost $1.2bn from its budget in 2015 after warnings from the service\u2019s public advocate that underfunding the IRS was certain to hasten financial ruin. \u201cIf the IRS lacks adequate funding to do its job effectively, the government will have fewer dollars available to fund all federal programs,\u201d wrote IRS taxpayer advocate Nina Olsen in her 2013 report to Congress, \u201cincluding national defense, social security, Medicare, veterans\u2019 benefits, medical research, and disaster relief \u2013 or simply to reduce the deficit.\u201d Even without kneecapping the IRS, Trump\u2019s plans are estimated by the politically conservative Tax Foundation to increase the deficit by $10tn. In 2014 liberal policy group the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities called the cuts \u2013 deeper every year since Olsen\u2019s warning \u2013 \u201ca field day for tax cheats\u201d, with hundreds of millions in cuts resulting in about $30bn less in tax revenue. Build a wall with Mexico* *Just kidding. In fact, given the 1,954-mile length of the US-Mexico border and the rough estimate of $25bn provided to the Washington Post by a construction firm economist, the vast sum in taxes Trump probably managed to avoid would be worth about 3.66% of the total bill to American taxpayers, at least if the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, is to be believed.

According to estimates from Unesco\u2019s Institute for Statistics (UIS), published to coincide with World Teachers\u2019 Day on 5 October, the international community needs to recruit 24.4 million primary school teachers, and 44.4 million secondary school teachers, in order to achieve the ambition of universal education outlined in the sustainable development agenda.   Pakistan must boost its teacher recruitment rate by 6% to reach 2030 target   It is a huge aspiration, not least because an estimated 263 million children worldwide \u2013 including 25 million who are unlikely ever to receive any form of education \u2013 are out of school, according to a Unesco paper published this month. At secondary level, just 14% of young people in poor countries complete their studies. In sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 the region with the fastest growing school-age population \u2013 more than 70% of countries face teacher shortages in primary schools, while 90% do not have enough secondary teachers, according to the data. In order to meet sustainable development goal four, which specifically calls for more qualified teachers and more teacher training in developing countries, roughly 17 million primary and secondary teachers will need to be recruited and trained in sub-Saharan Africa within the next 14 years.  South Asia faces the second largest teacher shortage, with an additional 15 million teachers \u2013 11 million at secondary level \u2013 needed by 2030.  \u201cEntire education systems are gearing up for the big push to achieve sustainable development goal four by 2030,\u201d said Silvia Montoya, director of Unesco\u2019s institute of statistics.  \u201cBut education systems are only as good as their teachers. Global progress will depend on whether there is even a teacher, or a classroom, in which to teach with a manageable number of children instead of 60, 70 or even more pupils. We also need training, resources and support for teachers to do their job.\u201d    Steady teacher recruitment in Cuba will see teacher gaps filled by 2016   The 2030 education goal builds on the millennium development goal to achieve universal primary schooling, under which enrolment in primary education rose from 83% in 2000 to 91% in 2015, according to UN figures. Getting children into school is only the first step, said Unicef\u2019s deputy executive director, Justin Forsyth, since the international community must also focus on how to keep them there. \u201cWell trained teachers are the key to children learning properly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to close this education gap: without highly-trained teachers, children will go to school but they won\u2019t have the skills to write, read or add up.\u201d In Ghana, pilot teacher training schemes have used technology including solar-powered infrastructure and satellite links to deliver distance learning courses. The $2m (\u00a31.5m) Train for Tomorrow project, funded by Dubai Cares and delivered by the Varkey Foundation, involves instructing teachers face-to-face in \u201chub\u201d schools so that, using interactive distance learning, they are then able instruct other educators. The Varkey Foundation\u2019s CEO, Vikas Pota, said: \u201cThe original 40 connected schools allow us to reach 5,000 teachers from our studios in Accra, and the project can be expanded by installing the technology package in further schools.\u201d   Related: Why are 63 million girls missing out on education? \u2013 podcast    Using this model, said Pota, training costs $200 a teacher until infrastructure is in place, at which point the cost decreases to $150 a teacher. David Archer, head of programme development for ActionAid, recommended a broader approach to finding solutions. He said: \u201cThere are many innovative ways to improve the training and continuing professional development of teachers, and distance learning can play a role \u2013 but is not in itself a magic bullet.\u201d Unesco figures show that while the number of primary school teachers in Ghana has increased by 61% over the past decade, there was a decrease in trained teachers from 72% in 1999 to 53% in 2013. The distance-learning method allows teachers to learn novel methods of teaching, which, especially in Africa, have relied for too long on rote learning and dictation, said Pota.  Teachers also need to be paid more and paid on time, argue campaigners. Teachers\u2019 salaries are often so low that they are forced to live hand-to-mouth, supplementing their work with other jobs or spending decades disputing their pay (as is the case in Kenya).  But other socioeconomic and gender factors affect how long a child stays in school, said Forsyth, who pointed to issues such as poor sanitation and the absence of doors on toilets as reasons why girls may stop attending school. He said: \u201cSo many children go to school and then drop out because of poverty \u2013 they have to work instead.

Freddy Shepherd and the \u2018Toongate tapes\u2019, 1998 Mahmood won Reporter of the Year in 1999 after he revealed that the Newcastle United chairman and his deputy had described women from Newcastle as \u201cdogs\u201d, mocked ex-manager Kevin Keegan for being like Shirley Temple and laughed at loyal supporters, known as the Toon Army, for buying expensive replica shirts. Freddy Shepherd and Doug Hall made the reckless comments while on a drunken tour of lap-dancing bars in the \u201cmillionaires\u2019 harbour\u201d of Puerto Ban\u00fas in Marbella. Having stepped down after the News of the World splashed the story, Shepherd surprisingly returned to his post six months later. The Countess of Wessex, 2001 Sophie Wessex reportedly had to write grovelling apologies to Prince Charles, Tony Blair and William Hague after Mahmood lured her into making highly embarrassing comments about them. The countess was set up by the News of the World at the Dorchester hotel, where she had gone to secure a PR contract with a Saudi prince. In the meeting, not only did she lampoon William Hague for his appearance and Yorkshire accent, but she went on to refer to \u201cPresident Blair\u201d and the \u201cpap budget\u201d delivered by Gordon Brown. The countess was forced to resigned from her PR firm. Mahmood took another royal scalp in 2005 when he posed as a property tycoon interested in buying Princess Michael of Kent\u2019s 17th-century Cotswolds manor house. The princess gossiped freely about other royals, hinting that Prince Charles had only married Diana as \u201ca womb \u2026 somebody to give him children\u201d. In 2010 Sarah Ferguson told Mahmood she could get him access to her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, who was a quasi-official British trade envoy, in return for \u00a3500,000. Ferguson later explained her desperation, saying she was \u201cin the gutter\u201d due to drinking. David and Victoria Beckham \u2018kidnap plot\u2019, 2002 Hailed as the greatest-ever scoop, a sting operation by Mahmood backfired spectacularly when the trial of five men accused of plotting to kidnap Victoria Beckham and her children collapsed after it was revealed that the News of the World had paid \u00a310,000 for the story from an unreliable source. Carole Caplin, 2005 Cherie Blair\u2019s former lifestyle guru told Mahmood, posing as a potential client, that \u201cTony\u2019s in dire straits\u201d, calling him \u201coverweight\u201d and suggesting he drank too much.

To the French capital, then, where the old mystery Fiat strikes again, lending its nutty kitemark to a story hardly short of dramatics. Already a mirthless 9,000-word think piece waiting to happen, the\u00a0Kardashian burglary is establishing itself as a key cultural event of 2016, rich with meanings and takeouts and significances for a culture struggling to\u00a0work out what it thinks about aggravated burglary. Where you position yourself to it matters \u2013 matters absolutely \u2013 and I\u2019m afraid some of you may find yourself already in a position from which you simply cannot now recover. For instance, those of you who failed to make some sort of social media post in the immediate aftermath of the news breaking, in which you said something about it being \u201cno secret\u201d how you felt about the Kardashians, but that Kim deserved \u201cnothing but sympathy\u201d for being the victim of such an ordeal. Anyone who sent a tweet like that is a\u00a0decent individual who not only apparently thinks about whether violent crime is justified, but feels moved to temper their conclusion that\u00a0it isn\u2019t with a reminder that the Kardashians are basically beneath them. These sort of tweeters have to take themselves seriously, because God knows no one else possibly could. Anyway, as part of its peerless commitment to service journalism, Lost in Showbiz is pleased to offer you a full primer on the emerging key dramatis personae of this developing crime story, in order that you can keep up with the caper. First and foremost, poor Kim is back in the United States and in seclusion, as yet unwilling to discuss the matter on any platform. All that has formally emerged is a communique from her makeup artist, who announces that the\u00a0cosmetics masterclass the pair were due to host in Dubai has been cancelled in the circumstances. But, in Kim\u2019s absence \u2013 and fighting her for the lead role \u2013 we have the scenery-chewing ham that is Inspector Karl Lagerfeld. The most adorably clueless detective since Clouseau, Chanel commandant Karl was almost instantly on the metaphorical crime scene in his trademark trenchcoat and highnecked blouse, dispensing quotable quotes on how vulgar the victim is. Think of him as A Shit in the Dark. But also be aware that Karl is a Proper Celebrity, whose willingness to say ordinarily unspeakable things marks him out as someone who adds to the gaiety of the nations. Listen: he\u2019s the head designer of the most prestigious and self-regarding fashion house in the world. Also: look at him. What do you honestly want to hear from Karl? Some boring off-the-peg worthiness about body image, or how only ethically sourced style slaves fluff his boucl\u00e9 for him? Course you don\u2019t. Karl instinctively understands this, which is why he mused unwonderingly of L\u2019affaire Kardashian: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she was in a hotel with no security. If you\u2019re that famous and you put all your jewellery on the internet, then you go to a hotel where nobody can come near to the room. You cannot display your wealth and then be surprised that some people want to share it with you.\u201d Oh Karl! What a knowingly incendiary use of the word \u201cshare\u201d that is. On the one hand, it\u2019s a bit rich from someone whose place of work relies particularly on revenues from flogging instantly recognisable handbags that can only be\u00a0filed under the category \u201cobvious display\u201d. On the other, Kim got away lightly in the parvenue stakes. Even Marcel Proust was recently written off\u00a0by Karl as \u201cthe son of a concierge looking at society people\u201d. Such a crime could never happen to Inspector Lagerfeld himself, of course; he keeps a manservant highly trained in martial arts in his apartment, who is\u00a0required to attack him the minute he\u00a0struts in via his haunted mirror but\u00a0always ends up submitting to Karl eventually. His master is simply too masterful. Anyway, our next stop in the cast of characters must surely be the French police, who also felt moved to cast aspersions on the victim. \u201cIt was really\u00a0the celebrity who was targeted,\u201d pointed out a police spokeswoman, \u201cwith possessions that had been seen and noticed via social media, and it was these goods that the attackers targeted.\u201d Mmm. Do they do this in rape cases, or is it just aggravated burglary? Either way, madame had more to add: \u201cThis kind of incident is extremely rare in Paris. This is a star that is famous worldwide. Do not confuse what happened to Ms Kardashian, and probably was the result of an organised team who had planned their action, with the\u00a0assault of a tourist in front of Notre Dame or another tourist spot in Paris.\u201d Well, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear plenty more\u00a0from them in due course. Finally, though, we must make special mention of the gang being fingered for the job, who are called \u2013 mais oui! \u2013 the Pink Panthers. Furthermore, these are the Serbian Pink Panthers, and someone who thinks of himself as one of their ex-members has been on to the Daily Beast to discuss their modus operandi. \u201cThe ones that did this, do you think you\u2019ll find them?\u201d he inquires rhetorically. \u201cNo way, they\u2019re probably in Ibiza with Paris Hilton.\u201d (Need a bit more on that \u201cwith\u201d, to be honest. Is Paris the moll or the mark? Inquiring minds want to know.) In the meantime, this amusing chap seems to be suggesting that the Pink Panthers are a bit like al-Qaida, and lack a conventional command structure. \u201cThey think it\u2019s one organisation with 400 members and one boss.\u201d Not so, apparently. \u201cThese people were a part of the [Yugoslav] military and, when the country broke up, they became r\u014dnin, like the samurai. They don\u2019t have a master. No leader. No head and no tail. All they do is they go by their intelligence.\u201d Go on: \u201cThey travel with the fashion show or the tennis players or the athletes. This is a very prestigious affair. All the Pink Panthers have college educations. They speak multiple languages fluently. They all play soccer. They\u2019re athletes.\u201d Well, how fitting. These are not vulgar armed robbers, you understand. These are classy, prestigious armed robbers, as at home in the frow of Yves Saint Laurent as they are playing as a classic No 10. We are not quite \u2013 but very nearly \u2013 at the point where being gagged, tied up and thrown in the bath by them is a privilege. In fact, the entire tale is rapidly emerging as the film Zoolander 2 could have been, and we must look forward to its next instalment as soon as any of the players cares to\u00a0share it.", "title": "Kim Kardashian, the Pink Panthers and the missing jewels", "sentences": ["All that has formally emerged is a communique from her makeup artist, who announces that the\u00a0cosmetics masterclass the pair were due to host in Dubai has been cancelled in the circumstances."], "publicationDate": "2016-10-06T17:13:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/england-day-night-test-2017-west-indies-edgbaston", "tags": ["England cricket team", "West Indies cricket team", "ECB", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "England\u2019s first Test against West Indies at Edgbaston next August will be a day-night match played with a pink ball, the first of its kind in the country, the England and Wales Cricket Board has confirmed. The England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s director, the former England captain Andrew Strauss, says the move will \u201cbreathe a bit of life into the Test match game.\u201d Last November, Australia hosted New Zealand in the inaugural pink-ball Test, a game which was over inside three days but saw more than 123,000 fans go through the gates at the Adelaide Oval. The ECB\u2019s decision to host one as soon as next year is in part due to the fact the Adelaide Test of the 2017-18 Ashes series will be a day-nighter, but is also down to a desire to broaden the game\u2019s appeal. \u201cThis is all about new audiences and doing all we could to make the game more accessible at every level,\u201d said the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, in Dhaka. \u201cThis gives us an opportunity to find out if Test cricket played at a different time of day, under different conditions, at a time of year when people possibly don\u2019t get to go to a full day game, has a dramatic impact on attendance. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d   Related: Alastair Cook rejects calls for day-night Ashes Tests    Starting next Thursday in Dubai, Pakistan and West Indies will play the second pink-ball Test, while Australia have two scheduled for their upcoming summer, against South Africa in Adelaide, then Pakistan in Brisbane. In England, a pink-ball Test is highly unlikely to happen in the summer of 2018 because the visitors, India and Pakistan, do not have favourable timezones for its broadcast. The ECB had hoped to stage a County Championship pink-ball trial before the end of the 2016 season, but the frenetic, high-stakes nature of the final weeks of the campaign prevented it. Warwickshire Second XI played their Worcestershire counterparts under lights at Edgbaston in August, in a bid to replicate the conditions faced next summer, when the Test is scheduled for 17-21 August. The trial was deemed a success by players and umpires. Some Australian players were critical of the concept in the lead up to the first day-night Test last year, but England\u2019s players are said to be keen on the idea. The ball used will be a Dukes (which was deemed to have fared better than its Kookaburra counterpart during the Edgbaston trial), although it is as yet unclear whether it will have a dark or light seam. Harrison is confident that the ball \u2013 which has been the subject of plenty of scrutiny, with the Kookaburra model criticised by players on both sides during the Adelaide Test \u2013 will \u201ccontinue to improve over the months ahead. We are comfortable with the development of the ball, otherwise it would not have got through our cricket committee.\u201d The MCC has been at the forefront of developing the ball and was keen to host the fixture at Lord\u2019s, but Edgbaston was chosen because Test cricket always sells strongly in London. Initially tickets will be sold for a full day\u2019s play, but it is likely that the option to purchase twilight tickets \u2013 perhaps for the final two sessions \u2013 will be available closer to the Test. \u201cIn London we put a Test match on and it sells out,\u201d said Harrison. \u201cOutside London it\u2019s not that simple. Maybe this helps bring in some of those people that haven\u2019t been to Edgbaston before. England historically love playing at Edgbaston, it\u2019s a great venue.\u201d Both England and West Indies will have formal warm-up matches \u2013 the tourists\u2019 game will take place in Derby \u2013 and the hours of play during the Test are set to be 2pm until 9pm (and can run no later than 9.50pm), with the lights taking full effect as late as 7.45pm.

In the event, they could not manage even to beat his pacemaker. Churchill, the odds-on favourite, powered home a length-and-a-quarter in front of Lancaster Bomber, at 66-1, as O\u2019Brien\u2019s Ballydoyle yard saw off all-comers in a Group One for the third time in six days. Last Sunday, it was Chantilly, where O\u2019Brien saddled the one-two-three in the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, while on the first day of Future Champions Weekend here, he had the forecast in the Fillies\u2019 Mile. Following Churchill\u2019s success, the trainer moved to 20 Group One wins on the Flat in 2016, plus a Grade One at Cheltenham\u2019s National Hunt Festival in March for good measure, and he was cut to 4-7 from evens by William Hill to beat the American trainer Bobby Frankel\u2019s record of 25 top-level victories in a calendar year. Churchill, meanwhile, reinforced his position as the favourite for the 2,000 Guineas and Derby next season, having won five races in a row since finishing third on his debut in May. He is top-priced at 2-1 for the 2,000 Guineas, in a market where the first horse from outside the O\u2019Brien stable is 20-1, and available at 8-1 to give O\u2019Brien his fourth win in the Derby in six years at Epsom in June. Churchill was sweating freely underneath his saddle before being loaded into the stalls, but settled immediately for Ryan Moore once the race was underway and after switching to his right just over a furlong out, the favourite quickly surged into a decisive lead. Lancaster Bomber seemed to be dropping away but stayed on again in the closing stages to take second, and underline O\u2019Brien\u2019s dominance of the 2016 campaign ahead of Champions Day at Ascot next Saturday. A good day there could mean O\u2019Brien would become the first trainer to pass \u00a37m in prize-money in a British season, two months after he became the first to reach \u00a36m. He has won more than \u00a31m more than the next two trainers in the list, John Gosden and Richard Hannon, put together. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do a lot when he gets there and he never will, but you\u2019d be very happy with him,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt got a little bit tight, but the experience will have done him good. There\u2019s a massive engine in there. \u201cHe\u2019s physically a very imposing horse, as imposing a two-year-old as we\u2019ve ever trained. He\u2019s got a great mind, he relaxes and just does the minimum, which is brilliant. The qualities are all there in abundance. He\u2019s very special and he\u2019s done everything from day one. \u201cWe always viewed him as a miler,\u201d O\u2019Brien added, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t go further. He started over six, but he\u2019s so relaxed and laid-back, he saves everything and his mind is very strong.\u201d Such is the strength in depth of O\u2019Brien\u2019s juvenile squad that Churchill emerged as his main contender for the this race only when Caravaggio, the brilliant winner of the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot, was ruled out for the season with a minor injury. \u201cThis is a very special colt,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe\u2019s just so strong and such a good mover, with a great brain. He didn\u2019t feel like he was anywhere near his limit. He just does what he has to do and he\u2019s a pleasure. \u201c[Aidan had] a 1-2 today, and a 1-2 yesterday. These horses just keep performing every week, and they\u2019ve raced a lot. He [Churchill] has had six runs now, the mare [Found] had run every month bar July, and Highland Reel [the King George winner] ran every month bar June. \u201cThis horse today, it wouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019d been beaten on your last 100 rides, you\u2019d have been confident riding him because you just know that there\u2019s an awful lot left.\u201d Churchill is, like so many of O\u2019Brien\u2019s runners, a son of Galileo, but there are mixed messages in his pedigree when it comes to potential to stay 12 furlongs. Meow, his dam, was a sprinter, but her half-sister Always Aloof stayed 10 furlongs, and the manner of his win here certainly offers hope that he will stay the Derby trip. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can rule out the Derby,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHis mind will allow him to get most trips as long as the speed doesn\u2019t stretch out too far. He has an awful lot of natural pace, but he is very relaxed doing that and he is by Galileo.\u201d Silvestre de Sousa will need to produce an extraordinary run of form to overtake Jim Crowley and retain the jockey\u2019s title before the campaign ends next Saturday, but he did at least match Crowley\u2019s success on Island Vision earlier on the card when Sweet Selection stayed on strongly through the last quarter-mile to finish three lengths clear of First Mohican in the Cesarewitch Handicap. \u201cShe is just incredibly tough,\u201d Hughie Morrison, the winner\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cSilvestre said he was beaten five furlongs out \u2026 but when they quickened, she nipped up the inside and just kept going and went clear. You think that she is going to get caught, but she didn\u2019t. \u201cWe will probably put her in the Ascot Gold Cup [next season] but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was the Queen Alexandra [also at Royal Ascot] that we went for.\u201d Saeed bin Suroor has endured a difficult season but his string has found some form in recent weeks and he saddled his sixth winner from 18 runners in October when Best Solution crossed the line two lengths clear of Zainhom in the Group Three Autumn Stakes. \u201cHe is not in the Racing Post Trophy [at Doncaster in a fortnight] and it is too close to this race with two weeks between them,\u201d Suroor said. \u201cWe will have a look, though.

One of the world\u2019s largest superyachts, the Philippe Starck-designed, 119-metre (390ft) white vessel \u2013 which features three swimming pools, a helipad and bombproof glass \u2013 embodies an exclusive lifestyle that is highly visible but inaccessible to all but the global financial elite and their entourage. But Melnichenko, who made his \u00a39.2bn fortune in coal and fertilisers, has put the distinctive boat up for sale after upgrading to the \u00a3347m, 143-metre Sailing Yacht A, believed to be similarly named to ensure it is listed first in shipping registers. His new vessel, which features three carbon masts more than 90 metres tall with a sail area greater than a standard football pitch, is the tenth-largest superyacht in the world. It propels him into the premier league of private yacht owners alongside fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, whose 162.5-metre Eclipse is currently the second-largest. The Chelsea football club owner\u2019s spectacular \u00a3724m vessel, which made headlines last summer when it briefly moored on the river Clyde in Scotland, far from its usual cruising grounds, is believed to feature two swimming pools (one of which has an adjustable depth that allows it to be converted into a dancefloor), an exterior fireplace, a leisure submarine, armour plating, bulletproof windows, a missile defence system and an anti-paparazzi shield designed to dazzle digital cameras. But one British academic has managed to penetrate this elusive milieu. Emma Spence has spent the last six years researching the industry, has crewed on superyachts around the world and shadowed a yacht broker in the tax haven of Monaco, observing how the boats are deployed to establish a pecking order among the super-rich. The researcher is completing a PhD on the superyacht scene and says the vessels are unique among prestige assets: unlike private jets they are not a useful mode of transport; unlike art and property, they always depreciate in value. Instead, as one owner told her, what makes a yacht desirable is that it \u201callows the super-rich to perform their wealth status\u201d.   Related: Sun, sea and silver service: what\u2019s it like crewing on a superyacht?    Superyachts are defined as boats with hulls that measure longer than 24 metres at the waterline and that require a professional crew to operate. With basic annual maintenance and operation costs expected to be 10% of the original purchase price, ownership is the preserve of multi-millionaires and billionaires. In a forthcoming book on the lifestyles of the super-rich, Spence explains how merely possessing these elite craft is not enough to enhance the profile of the super-rich; how and where the yacht is used is equally important. This is why most owners and charterers of the luxury vessels prefer to go to prominent ports with bars and restaurants where they can guarantee an audience of super-rich peers. Her research focused on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the centre of the superyacht scene, where hundreds of luxury vessels line the docks in Saint-Tropez, Nice, Antibes, Cannes and Monaco, the most prestigious port in the Mediterranean. Among the owners she witnessed projecting their status were billionaire retailer Sir Philip Green, who took delivery of his third superyacht \u2013 the \u00a3100m, 90-metre Lionheart, his second boat to bear that name \u2013 earlier this year. While she was crewing on a yacht belonging to somebody else in Saint-Tropez in 2013, Green came on board without invitation. \u201cHe walked up on the aft deck in board shorts and a T-shirt \u2013 standard super-rich attire, as casual as you can be,\u201d she says. \u201cThe grownup children [of the owner] and friends all immediately stood to attention until he told them it was OK to sit down. I\u2019ve never seen anyone else command that respect on someone else\u2019s yacht.\u201d The perma-tanned Topshop tycoon recently finished a two-month Mediterranean cruise with his wife, Tina, leaving their daughter, Chloe, on board in Monaco, where yacht owners and industry insiders gathered last month at the world\u2019s most prestigious yacht show to size up one another\u2019s nautical assets. \u201cThe family\u2019s got a permanent berth there and I\u2019ve docked alongside him for many years,\u201d says Spence. \u201cOne time, years ago in Monaco, a \u2018rival\u2019 crew climbed on board in the night and changed the boat\u2019s name with tape to Lion Fart.\u201d     Philip Green\u2019s yacht Lionheart. Photograph: http://livornodailyphoto.blogspot.co.uk    Some yacht owners are attracted to tourist resorts in the French Riviera because an integral part of their lifestyle is projecting their privilege beyond their elite peer group, Spence adds. \u201cYou have this tension between the privacy that yachts and the sea afford against this desire to see and be seen,\u201d she says. \u201cTourists remind the super-rich of their wealth and their social status. In Saint-Tropez, you have hundreds of people on the docks as the yachts come in. The guests sit there on the aft deck. Most of these people you wouldn\u2019t know if you passed them in the street. They\u2019re not celebrities. But when they finally descend [ashore] there\u2019s still this awe.\u201d Spence saw how a group of young men who were children of superyacht owners often encourage this fascination with their way of life. \u201cEach night, they\u2019d go to big clubs, such as the VIP Rooms in Saint-Tropez or Gotha in Cannes, spend \u00a35,000, \u00a310,000 on a table and buy huge bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon with sparklers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of young women that spends the day going from one port to the other, getting entry to these clubs and schmoozing these wealthy young men. The women come on board the boats, go up to the top deck and ask for champagne. They\u2019re all drunk and you\u2019re trying to explain at 3am that they can\u2019t wear stilettos on board.\u201d While in the clubs of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, uber-wealthy heirs might lavish money on these hangers-on, but back on their parents\u2019 yachts, their attitude changes. \u201cOn board, it\u2019s the parent\u2019s stack of wine \u2013 it\u2019s not something to be given away,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe older son of one owner came down to check I was serving the cheapest champagne. You downgrade from vintage Dom to Veuve Clicquot \u2013 from 100 euros a bottle to 30 euros.\u201d The super-rich also use their yachts to control the level of access they grant to those outside their wealthy circle, says Spence. For example, some exploited maritime law to get rid of the young women they brought back from the clubs. In the morning, they would go to bed and order the yacht to leave port, knowing the crew would have to remove any stragglers before they set sail. \u201cIf you\u2019re in port then you can have as many people on board as you want but at sea you can only have 12 passengers, unless you have large-yacht certification,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe owner\u2019s sons would just slink off to their cabins leaving a few random women dotted around the yacht. It\u2019s awkward when these people think they\u2019re going to stay and spend the week partying on a yacht and then they\u2019re unceremoniously kicked off.\u201d   Related: Yachts, jets and stacks of cash: super-rich discover risks of Instagram snaps    The symbiotic relationship between superyacht owners and crew is not as one-sided as it might appear. During the Monaco Grand Prix, securing the most prestigious berth on the T-jetty \u2013 the first row of yachts on the race start line \u2013 is reliant on the captain\u2019s contacts, not the owner\u2019s, says Spence. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing who to pay extra to for the privilege. It\u2019s a reflection of the owner\u2019s status, but it\u2019s done via the connections of the crew. If your captain speaks fluent French and has worked in the industry for years, then they\u2019ll have much a better chance of getting into a prominent position in the port.\u201d \u201cThe whole industry is completely gendered,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe interior crew are women and the deck crew are male. I\u2019ve come across two female captains in six years of researching the industry, and I know of two chief stewards who are female. The women retire because owners don\u2019t want them in the interior of a boat after a certain age \u2013 late 30s and you\u2019re off.\u201d The majority of owners buy superyachts secondhand via brokers and refit them to their tastes. Camper &amp; Nicholsons put the global number of yachts of at least 30 metres at 4,476, with 268 sold via brokers last year at a total cost of $2.68bn (\u00a32.18bn), or an average of $10m. They estimate that 222 yachts of over 30 metres have been bought worldwide so far this year. The next step up is to buy or commission a \u201cseries yacht\u201d from a shipyard, which will have the same cabin configuration, exterior style and machinery across the line, but the owner will dictate the furniture and furnishings. The top tier are custom-designed by naval architects and can take shipyards several years to complete. Peter Thompson, a broker at Monaco-based Thompson, Westwood and White Yachts, says eastern European oligarchs and Gulf royals dominate the 100-metre-plus superyacht market, also known as gigayachts. The primary factor behind the increasing size of superyachts is the growing wealth of the super-rich. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, with net assets of at least $30m, rose by 61% between 2005 and 2015 to 187,468 worldwide, according to the latest wealth report by estate agent Knight Frank. Of these, Credit Suisse calculates that the number worth at least $100m rose from 30,000 in 2010 to 44,900 in 2015, while those with assets above $500m increased from 2,800 to 4,500 in the same period.     Roman Abramovich\u2019s yacht Eclipse. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    Broker Simon Goldsworthy, of luxury yachting specialists Camper &amp; Nicholsons, says: \u201cThe client who 15 years ago would have been satisfied with a 40-metre [yacht], which would then have been one of the largest yachts in the bay, is now surrounded by dozens of yachts of 60-70 metres, and this plants the seed that he really ought to upgrade.\u201d Innovative design has also played a part \u2013 there are things you can fit onto a 60-metre yacht that you simply can\u2019t fit on to a 40-metre one, such as infinity pools, helipads, cinemas, dive rooms, and so on. Evan K Marshall, a London-based superyacht designer, says many of his clients\u2019 yachts are more expensive, and far more personalised, than their homes. \u201cWithin the circles of friends who own vessels, there is a healthy competition,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone says: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve just ordered an 80-metre,\u2019 his friend\u2019s going to be on the phone to his broker: \u201cListen, I\u2019m thinking of building an 85-metre!\u201d We love that.\u201d Among Marshall\u2019s most prolific clients is the Brooklyn automotive tycoon John Staluppi, who names his boats after James Bond films. Last year, he ordered his 19th superyacht, the 66-metre Spectre, due to be delivered by the Italian Benneti shipyards in 2017. Thompson, who was involved in many of the projects, says Staluppi gets a new superyacht every 18 months to three years, compared with a client average of every five to seven years. \u201cThe first one I did was The World is Not Enough, then he sold that and bought Quantum of Solace, then he sold that and bought Casino Royale, then Diamonds are Forever. Right now we\u2019ve got Skyfall and there\u2019s Spectre on the way. He loves the creation side of it. But he doesn\u2019t travel a lot. He uses them as floating homes.\u201d In the French Riviera, many owners flip between staying on board their yacht or in their luxury villas or mansions, says Spence. \u201cThey would have a fully staffed house and the boat doing exactly the same thing, 20 minutes\u2019 drive away. You\u2019d both be on call, so you wouldn\u2019t know when the owner would turn up at the house or the boat. So you would have a system that the staff at the house would call ahead to the boat, and the owners would appear 10 minutes later and you\u2019d just happen to have fresh towels and scented water waiting for them.\u201d In recent years, a growing number of superyacht owners and charterers, particularly those under 40, have cruised further afield than the \u201cmilk run\u201d of Mediterranean resorts to remote routes, including the Arctic Northwest Passage, fuelling demand for designer icebreakers, such as the SeaExplorer range. William Mathieson, editorial director of the Superyacht Group, says this trend for \u201cexpedition yachts\u201d is due to an emergent younger super-wealthy class \u2013 from heirs to dotcom billionaires \u2013 \u201cwho want to chase an elusive experience\u201d. Although some owners might pursue remote and exotic adventures, he suspects that for others it will become the yachting equivalent of the Chelsea tractor. While Spence says this trend partly reflects that yachting still involves romanticised notions of escape, it is also rooted in owners\u2019 preoccupation with bragging rights. She crewed on one yacht that was sailing around the world; the owners would just fly in when it reached a certain port of call. \u201cThey would leave it in the Med then fly down to Mauritius, then would fly back again when it\u2019s in India,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re really using it as a floating hotel. They would eat meals on board and pop off to do a bit of shopping. \u201cHaving their yacht in far-removed locations is a social statement in itself, even if they do not make it on board themselves. Even mooring your yacht on the Thames is conspicuous in that it is far removed from the south of France where all the other yachts are.\u201d     Superyachts in the harbour at Monte Carlo.

The chestnut, such an impressive winner of the 2,000 Guineas, is reckoned to be close to his peak once more for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Saturday but will need to be, with Minding and Ribchester expected to line up against him. \u201cI\u2019m really confident he\u2019s going to go to Ascot at the peak of his powers,\u201d Hugo Palmer said after watching his Qatari\u2011owned colt cantering up Long Hill at 7am. The trainer would have given a different answer about a month ago, when the horse bruised a foot and missed work, leaving no margin for error in his preparation. Everything has gone smoothly since, Palmer reports, and he is inclined to think the horse will be better suited by his two-month absence than the mere 18 days between his Sussex Stakes success and his flop in the Prix Jacques Le Marois. \u201cQuite simply, we didn\u2019t have the time between races to get the work into him to settle him down,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cHe had the luxury of his own private jet to Deauville. Part of me just wonders whether, if we\u2019d treated him a bit more normally, the edge might have been taken off him by the journey. He just was too fresh and he over-raced.\u201d   Related: Horse racing tips: Tuesday 11 October    Galileo Gold needs a lot of work if the fizz is to be kept out of him, to the extent of cantering every Sunday when most of his stablemates get the day off. Temperament has also dictated he does most of his work on Long Hill; months ago, he refused for days in a row to cross the road that separates it from Warren Hill and Palmer gave up trying to insist. \u201cPeople always think of horses like humans, that what they really want to do is lie on a beach and recharge their batteries for a fortnight. He doesn\u2019t have a desire to sit down with an improving book. He\u2019s a racehorse, he likes a routine and he enjoys training. He\u2019s certainly showing no signs of being bored of it.\u201d Galileo Gold is reportedly \u201cbang on his racing weight\u201d, just 2kg below what he was when scoring at Royal Ascot. Now Palmer hopes a return to professional mid-race behaviour will help him turn around the Marois form with Ribchester. \u201cHe\u2019s raced 10 times in his life; the first time he ran, he pulled his chance away and the last time he ran, he pulled his chance away, but every other time he\u2019s been perfect. So I hope we can go back to what\u2019s happened on the other eight times.\u201d Beyond that, discussions have yet to take place as to whether Galileo Gold will go to the Breeders\u2019 Cup at Santa Anita next month or whether he will stay in training next year. He hopes to sway Sheikh Joaan by pointing to the \u00a32.5m on offer to the winner of the Dubai Turf in March. Palmer has a second shot at Qipco Champions Day glory with Architecture in the Fillies &amp; Mares race. The bookmakers offer 20-1, which the trainer described as \u201ccrazy\u201d. He said: \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done a lot wrong all year. There was that glorious moment when we thought we\u2019d won the Oaks. And there was a much shorter but equally glorious moment when I thought she\u2019d won the Irish Oaks. \u201cBy the looks of the betting, she\u2019s got to take on the filly that beat her both at Lingfield and at the Curragh [Seventh Heaven]. But there\u2019s no easy Group Ones and the same applies for that horse as it does for mine. They\u2019ve got to bring their A game to win these races and they\u2019re not machines.\u201d The season is now over for some of Palmer\u2019s better horses, including Gifted Master, Escobar and Unforgetable Filly, but he may yet send Best Of Days, his Royal Lodge winner, to the Racing Post Trophy a week on Saturday. A fortnight after that, Home Of The Brave has a choice of races at the Breeders\u2019 Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what to do,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThe Mile looks very hot but it\u2019s a much more valuable race. If Limato went to the Turf Sprint, maybe we\u2019d be better to take on Tepin [in the Mile]. I can\u2019t help thinking Tepin\u2019s best form is with a little bit of cut in the ground,\u201d which she is most unlikely to get at Santa Anita. Such concerns are the preserve of the high-profile trainer and Palmer is already in that bracket, having made extraordinary progress since the seven winners of his first season five years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s been a dream come true, really. The big worry is that you can\u2019t go on stepping up year on year because eventually there becomes nowhere to go.

Rooney had asked to appear at England\u2019s press conference in Ljubljana so he could react in person to Southgate\u2019s decision and make it clear, two weeks before his 31st birthday, that he had reluctantly accepted the decision. His official status as captain will not change but the downturn in his career can also be measured by his wife Coleen\u2019s emotional response on Twitter and Southgate voicing strong objections about the culture in football of people taking malicious pleasure. \u201cIt is something which I have to go through,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cI am big enough to deal with it. I believe I can come back from this. I am 30 years of age. I am not 35 or 36 where you are thinking: \u2018Can you get back from it?\u2019 I will keep working and I have said before that I will not stop playing for England and start going to Dubai for a few days in the international break. \u201cAfter the summer it would have been easy for me to walk away and say: \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019ve had enough,\u2019 but that\u2019s not me.

I am not naive in terms of thinking that I am still a 20-year-old. I understand that. My game is different to that of a 20-year-old, but I also think I have qualities that can help move this team forward. I\u2019m not denying it\u2019s a difficult moment but I have to show the right attitude, try to be positive and make sure I am supportive of my team-mates.\u201d Southgate has decided to use Eric Dier alongside Henderson in the holding-midfield positions, citing \u201ctheir defensive responsibilities, their experience of playing in that role and their athleticism\u201d when he was asked why they been chosen ahead of Rooney.

On a human level it\u2019s a very difficult decision because I don\u2019t like the idea that there might be an element of satisfaction for some people. I\u2019m probably more annoyed by that than he is.

India and the US have consistently alleged that all three groups receive clandestine ISI support, a claim Pakistan denies. Dawn\u2019s allegations were all the more incendiary because of their timing just weeks after a deadly militant attack on an Indian military base in the disputed territory of Kashmir that Delhi has blamed on Pakistan-based jihadis. The government has repeatedly denied the story and announced on Monday that the matter had been discussed in a meeting with Sharif, Akhtar and the army chief, Gen Raheel Sharif.

Looking relaxed and refreshed, not to mention thinner, Bruce made his first public appearance as Roberto Di Matteo\u2019s successor on Thursday. The 55-year-old described returning Villa to the Premier League at the first time of asking \u2013 with the club 19th in the Championship having won one of their first 11 games of the season \u2013 as the \u201cbiggest challenge\u201d of his career but, after achieving a record four promotions from the second tier, he believes he can do that by bringing \u201cspirit and passion\u201d to the club.

The 30-year-old, who came through Villa\u2019s youth ranks and is their leading Premier League goalscorer with 73 goals in 322 games, was then ordered by the then caretaker manager Eric Black to improve his fitness before being told by Di Matteo at the start of this season that he was not part of his plans. The forward has subsequently been training with the under-23s while looking for a new club. But Bruce is adamant that every member of his squad is starting afresh under his charge \u2013 and that includes Agbonlahor. \u201cI\u2019ve said to them [the players] that I\u2019ve got no problem with any of them and that means Gabby, too,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe\u2019s had his problems and he\u2019s got to get himself into some sort of condition but, yes [he is training with the first team].\u201d Bruce resigned as Hull manager in July and has become the sixth man to take charge of Villa in the past 12 months and the second in five years to have also managed city rivals, Birmingham.

Two of the four promotions Bruce has achieved were with Birmingham, whom he managed between 2001 and 2007. \u201cOne of the hardest parts of management is trying to bring a club back after it\u2019s been relegated because there is a lot of doom and gloom around, especially among supporters,\u201d said Bruce, who has signed a rolling contract with Villa and appointed Stephen Clemence as first\u2011team coach after working with the former midfielder in the same capacity at Hull. \u201cThe first thing I and the players have to do is win back the supporters\u2019 trust and having lived in the area for 15 years I know they want to see their team play with spirit and passion.

The travel ban followed his report of a highly unusual rebuke by Pakistan\u2019s government of the country\u2019s military for supporting jihadi groups.  According to Dawn, senior generals were told at a closed-door meeting that the continued presence of militant groups who fight in India and Afghanistan but operate from Pakistan had made the country isolated internationally.

The government of Somaliland believes the impending split marks a pivotal moment, one that will free the UK to grant the self-declared state the international recognition it has been seeking for more than 25 years. \u201cI think Brexit will make it much easier for the British government to make up its mind,\u201d said Somaliland\u2019s foreign minister, Dr Saad Ali Shire.  \u201cUnder the EU, all the members have to abide by the EU policy regarding Somaliland. Britain did not have much leeway to make up its own mind. Being out of the EU [means] they can do whatever they want. I think it\u2019s good for us. I think they will have the flexibility in their foreign policy.\u201d   Related: Somaliland inspired by Scotland and Catalonia independence campaigns    Shire\u2019s comments come at a potentially transformative moment not just for the former British protectorate but also for the wider east African region, after one of the world\u2019s largest port operators announced a 30-year concession to manage and develop Somaliland\u2019s Berbera port. The $442m (\u00a3360m) deal between DP World and Somaliland \u2013 which has long sought deep-pocketed investors to modernise the port and exploit its offer of a free trade zone around Berbera \u2013 heralds a new gateway for trade between east Africa and the rest of the world.  Ethiopia, Somaliland\u2019s landlocked neighbour and one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies, is particularly likely to feel the benefit. The deal gives Ethiopia and DP World a potential alternative to the dominant Red Sea port in Djibouti, the government of which has been engaged in a legal wrangle with the Dubai-based firm in relation to its concessions there. The government of Somaliland regards the Berbera port project as crucial to the diversification of its largely pastoral economy. At present, the natural deepwater port is capable of handling 60,000 6.1-metre (20ft) containers annually. The new scheme is expected to increase capacity to 1.2m containers a year, attracting more shipping lines to east Africa.  Work on the port, developed by the Soviet Union during the cold war, is expected to be completed in 2019. \u201cThe main impact of the extension is the confidence it gives to international investors,\u201d said Shire. \u201cA lot of other people were on the sidelines and had not made up their minds about whether or not to invest in a country that was not recognised. I think it will boost the investment climate and encourage others to come in.\u201d Catalysts for economic development are a priority in Somaliland, which is struggling with the twin challenges of climate change and the recent arrival of large numbers of refugees escaping Yemen\u2019s civil war. Among the refugees are Somalis returning after fleeing in the opposite direction. The UN high commissioner for refugees, UNHCR, puts the figure at more than 9,500, although many more may be unregistered. \u201cThe foundation of our economy is livestock, but unfortunately the conditions are changing. The rains are smaller. We don\u2019t know when they are going to come, and also we have more frequent droughts. Now we have one every one or two years,\u201d said Shire. \u201cWe have to provide assistance to the people affected by the drought, so that will reduce our resources available to support the refugees from Yemen \u2013 so we really need immediate assistance with the drought and the refugees.\u201d The UK, which has hosted a series of talks aimed at repairing relations between Somaliland and Somalia, has been reluctant to endorse Somaliland\u2019s quest for recognition.

Opened in 1830 and restored many times since, it\u2019s meant to be\u00a0a place of fun, as cheap and cheerful as the town itself (\u201cSouthend is the Pier, the Pier is Southend,\u201d John Betjeman said). Certainly Rachel Lichtenstein, who grew up nearby and whose memories of the area are \u201cfilled with colour, noise and laughter\u201d, was unprepared for the night she spent five years ago moored beside the pier\u2019s lower deck in\u00a0a Dutch barge called (correct spelling and no irony) Ideaal: Something kept banging incessantly against the hull, metal on metal. It felt like we were in a war zone \u2026 I began to hear other noises aside from the banging \u2013 the clamour of a great crowd of people crying out \u2026 a woman\u2019s scream, the dreadful noise of children sobbing \u2013 the sound of hundreds of men shouting. It went on for hours, unbearably loud \u2026 Lichtenstein was among a group of people, mostly artists, on a voyage exploring the Thames Estuary \u2013 downriver from Tower Bridge to the sea. The voyage was cut short after the boat\u2019s engine clogged with silt and debris. But for her the journey had only just begun. After 15 years in east London, she had recently moved back to Leigh-on-Sea and wanted to learn about the history of the estuary \u2013 as well as finding a rational explanation for those terrifying noises under the pier. Part urban-industrial sprawl, part wild marshland, the Thames Estuary is\u00a0an area of 800 nautical square miles, stretching down past Clacton in Essex and Whitstable in Kent and out into the North Sea. Its people have often been treated with condescension and many of their settlements (Sheppey, Canvey Island, Jaywick etc) with derision. But it\u2019s also a place of subversive cultural energy, home to Dickens\u2019s Magwitch and the band Dr Feelgood. Through her\u00a0travels, interviews and researches, Lichtenstein restores its edgy pride and celebrates its muddy beauty. She talks to tugmen, dock workers, ornithologists and mudlarkers; takes part in a Thames barge race; walks the Broomway on Foulness, \u201cBritain\u2019s most dangerous path\u201d; gets tossed around in a cockleboat (\u201cit was like being inside a tumble dryer\u201d); and samples mud cola, a drink made from Estuary slime. She\u00a0is a generous listener \u2013 a diligent reader, too, paying homage to those who have trodden similar paths before her, including Robert MacFarlane, Ken Worpole, Iain Sinclair and WG Sebald. Rather than impose herself on the landscape, she lets it seep into her psyche. Unsurprisingly, after that night on the Ideeal, what often comes through is fear. Among the more obvious dangers is the SS Montgomery, which ran aground near Sheerness in 1944 with 1,400 tonnes of bombs on board. The wreck is still visible and carefully patrolled. The lone canoeist who once perched on top of it while eating a cheese sandwich can count himself lucky: according to one expert a detonation of\u00a0the unexploded bombs onboard would be enough to create a tidal wave engulfing the Isle of Sheppey. There are many other wrecks in the Estuary, more per square foot, we\u2019re told, than anywhere along the UK coastline, the most famous of them HMS London, which went down in 1665 with the loss of 300 lives (Pepys records the sinking in his diary). Divers continue to explore the wreck, at their peril: \u201cIf you came up on the surface when a container ship passes,\u201d one of them tells Lichtenstein, \u201cyou\u2019d be dead.\u201d Death is a recurrent theme in her account. The fishermen she talks to are stoics: the job may be smelly, exhausting and dangerous, but they\u2019d never give it up. Their wives are not so sanguine, least of all Jane Dolby, whose husband Colin disappeared with his trawler when a storm blew up from nowhere eight years ago. In memory of him, and to raise money for the charity that helped her out after he died, she set up the Fishwives Choir, whose recording of \u201cWhen the Boat Comes In\u201d was a hit single. Boats may be named after women and referred to in third-person feminine pronouns, but even today, it seems, having a woman on board is regarded as bad luck. The author\u2019s experiences don\u2019t exactly dispel the myth. One cold March day, she goes out on a sailing dinghy with two male friends, one of them a photographer, and they capsize. She saves the camera, and the memory card inside her ruined voice recorder miraculously works when played back. But her left hand is broken, and requires an operation to insert a metal plate. The morphine she is given to relieve the pain brings on nightmares \u2013 she\u2019s back with the ghosts under Southend Pier. For weeks she\u2019s laid low, bedbound and unable to write, let alone get back on the water.    Lichtenstein's vulnerability is engaging: she doesn\u2019t pretend that putting this book together has been plain sailing    Her vulnerability is engaging: she doesn\u2019t pretend that putting this book together has been plain sailing. Among the physical challenges is a trip to Sealand \u2013 the offshore fort declared as an independent principality in 1967 \u2013 which requires being winched up on to the seven-storey platform by rope. It\u2019s worth it for the view and to hear how much time members of the Bates family spend there since they laid claim to it. Not a lot, it seems, except when they\u2019re showing round film crews, though ever since the attempted seizure of Sealand by a group of Germans and Austrians in 1978 (an invasion that the Bateses repelled with sawn-off shotguns) they remain fiercely possessive of their rights.   Related: Martians, music and mud: how the Thames Estuary broadened cultural horizons    Sealand lies just outside British territorial waters. But even within the Thames Estuary, there\u2019s a history of lawlessness. It\u2019s inscribed in local place names (Dead Man\u2019s Island, Bedlams Bottom, Horrid Hill, Slaughterhouse Point) and persists in different kinds of\u00a0smuggling, whether of drugs or asylum seekers. To some, the building of the massive London Gateway Port is\u00a0just the latest instance in a long line of landgrabs and sea grabs. The port promises to create hundreds of jobs when it opens. Meanwhile, environmentalists claim, the dredging carried out by its owners, the Dubai-based company DP World, has destroyed much of the marine life (sprats, herring, cockles and oysters) on which local livelihoods depend. Lichtenstein dutifully makes room for opposing voices. Her prose reads flatly at times (unlike Sebald and Sinclair, she\u2019s no great stylist) but that\u00a0seems almost apt, given the level terrain, and she\u2019s an appealing guide: rather than come with prior knowledge, she learns as she goes along, and we learn with her. Did she know a brail from a gybe, or a gaff from a sprit, when she started? Probably not. And\u00a0for the rest of us who don\u2019t know,\u00a0there\u2019s a glossary. Though she never quite solves the mystery of Southend Pier, beyond noting the number of suicides and other tragedies in its vicinity, she does overcome her demons. The book culminates in a trip to explore the outer reaches of the estuary \u2013 the parts she failed to see five years before. At one point the yacht gets stuck on a sandbank, worryingly close to an offshore windfarm, colliding with which \u201cwould be like throwing a matchstick model against a brick wall\u201d. But she holds her nerve and even (as photographs show) takes the helm. Her mood is buoyant and so is the writing, with lovely descriptions of water, weather and sky.

Van Persie listened and swapped Arsenal for Manchester United, playing an instrumental role in the club winning the Premier League title for an unprecedented 20th time.   Related: Wayne Rooney confident Manchester United can build on Anfield draw    Van Persie is back at Old Trafford on Thursday but this time in the navy blue and yellow colours of Fenerbahce and it will be interesting to see what type of reception the Dutch striker receives from the home supporters, many of whom must have been surprised when he left United for Turkey in July 2015. His arrival certainly came as a surprise for followers of the Yellow Canaries. Turkish football is no stranger to extravagant welcoming parties for new signings but the arrival of Van\u00a0Persie set a precedent. By the time of his arrival at the Sabiha Gokcen airport the party was in full swing. Thousands turned out to welcome the player to Istanbul. Flares were lit. The crowds had already been chanting his name for a good hour. Television channels were tracking his flight live on air. Once the private jet in which Van\u00a0Persie arrived had landed, it was pandemonium. There was a carnival atmosphere. A sea of raucous supporters jumping up and down smothered in a thick clouds of colourful smoke from the flares, with some fans crowd-surfing in order to get to the front and grab a glimpse of their new star acquisition. For Van Persie it came as a shock . \u201cI have seen a lot over the years but I have never seen anything like this,\u201d he told a TV crew at the time. \u201cI hope that I\u2019m going to make you happy. It\u2019s an honour.\u201d The forward was a huge star in the Premier League but in his first evening in Istanbul he had reached a new level of cult status. It was love at first sight, but this story of romance also has a villain \u2013 the former Fenerbahce head coach Vitor Pereira felt it necessary to demonstrate his control over the team by showing he had the power to play and drop anybody. And that included Van\u00a0Persie. Pereira\u2019s plan soon backfired as fans grew increasingly frustrated that Fernand\u00e3o \u2013 who had been Super Lig\u2019s top scorer the previous season for Bursaspor \u2013 locked down a starting spot ahead of Van\u00a0Persie. To make matters worse, Pereira played a brand of football that was lacking in flair and attacking guile. After a summer of big spending \u2013 approximately \u00a322.9m \u2013 and bringing in attacking talents such as Van\u00a0Persie, Nani, Diego and Lazar Markovic, expectations were high. Fenerbahce had a squad most other teams in the league could only dream of, but they were not displaying that on the pitch. In fairness to Pereira, the Portuguese was in charge of a side in transition, one newly built at great expense that required time to gel. Results-wise, Fenerbahce actually had a decent 2015\u201116 league season; they dropped just six points at home and finished second, beaten to the title by a Besiktas team that had been building up steam over the previous two seasons. For Van Persie, however, often watching on from the substitutes bench, it had been a frustrating campaign. A few months in he said: \u201cTo be honest, I am not very happy at this moment. I was not happy that I started on the bench. I am fully fit, physically very well and able to play for 90 minutes. The only right answer I could give was with what I did: helping the team to get the victory.\u201d The Dutchman still managed to score 22 goals in all competitions and, in general, he settled well to life in Turkey. His son Shaqueel enrolled in the Fenerbahce academy and his wife Bouchra learned Turkish to the point she felt confident enough to give an interview to the media agency DHA in her new language. \u201cWe are happy in Istanbul as a family, it is a huge city like London,\u201d she said. \u201cJust as crowded, multicultural, with all the shops and a warmer climate.\u201d This season Van Persie has featured in five of Fenerbahce\u2019s seven Super Lig fixtures, not to mention their two Europa League qualifiers and two Europa League group matches, scoring once. And this has come under a new manager after Pereira was sacked in August following the club\u2019s defeat against Monaco in the Champions League qualifiers. Dick Advocaat came in and, having lost Nani to Valencia, signed Jeremain Lens, who played under the Dutchman at Sunderland, and the former Yellow Canaries striker Moussa Sow on loan from Al-Ahli in Dubai. Another summer of transition has told on the pitch, with Fenerbahce sitting ninth in the Super Lig, eight points behind the joint leaders, Basaksehir, Besiktas and Galatasaray. But they arrive in Manchester in decent European form having taken four points from their opening two Group\u00a0A fixtures. Van Persie is fit and almost certain to start. Back in 1996, Elvir Bolic scored the winning goal in Fenerbahce\u2019s 1-0 win against United at Old Trafford. Van\u00a0Persie has yet to have a defining moment for his latest club and for the 33-year-old there could be no greater one than emulating Bolic and scoring against his old one on Thursday.", "title": "Robin van Persie can remind Manchester United, and Fenerbahce, of quality | Emre Sarigul", "sentences": ["Dick Advocaat came in and, having lost Nani to Valencia, signed Jeremain Lens, who played under the Dutchman at Sunderland, and the former Yellow Canaries striker Moussa Sow on loan from Al-Ahli in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-10-20T09:00:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/florian-fritsch-golf-fear-of-flying", "tags": ["Golf", "European Tour", "Sport"], "article": "Late on Tuesday afternoon, Florian Fritsch is just to the south of Lisbon. This is a journey that began by road when his involvement in the British Masters ended, around 4.30pm on Sunday, included a voyage from Portsmouth to Bilbao and concluded at lunchtime on Thursday when the German teed off in the first round of the Portugal Masters. There is no charity or sponsorship element to reveal here. The 30-year-old\u2019s life, that of a professional within touching distance of full European Tour status for next season, is unique because of the form it takes. Fritsch estimates he drives 28,000 miles a year. This year he will play in 18 of the 27 events he is eligible for because they are the ones he can drive to. \u201cI average about 90kph [56mph],\u201d he says. \u201cThink about it; I probably spend a lot less time in my car than people who commute in and out of London. They are hardly moving.\u201d As a university student in the US, Fritsch used to \u201chop on and off planes like people take the bus\u201d but a decade ago, during a flight from Frankfurt to Turin, turbulence was to determine his future. During what he recalls as a \u201cvery rocky\u201d mid-air spell, he turned to a German amateur golf coach sitting alongside him to ask what would happen if the worst-case scenario transpired. \u201cIt will be very quick\u201d was the stark reply. Fritsch says: \u201cThat made me start to think more about the situation. At first it was a critical interest, then discomfort, then a little stress, then fear. I think it is a bit unfair to call it a phobia. I am afraid of a combination of circumstances, including heights. I have no problem with a rocky landing or take-off. I don\u2019t feel the same at 36,000ft.\u201d By 2010, the situation was acute. \u201cI was sitting in Zurich airport, waiting to head to Qatar for a tournament,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was too much for me to bear. I decided to go home on a train and quit golf.\u201d Fritsch was a fortnight too late to begin the process that would have made him a teaching professional. With limited status on the Challenge Tour, and little else to occupy himself, he returned to playing. By the end of that year, he had passed through qualifying school to earn a full European Tour card. \u201cI enjoyed it out there on my own,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt no pressure, like I had to do well to paint the picture of a perfect athlete. I was playing on my own terms. I was also actually quite mad. All my life I had been beating myself up over golf and the one year where I really didn\u2019t do anything, I earn that card. I thought: \u2018Is golf really that messed up?\u2019\u201d During these intervening years, Fritsch meddled with a dozen therapies \u2013 some of them weird and wonderful \u2013 to cure his fear. \u201cA bunch of them made it worse. I went to one of these airline seminars over a weekend, where 10 people sit around in a circle. You get asked what it is you are scared of and they end up with about seven points on the board because of duplication. \u201cI thought: \u2018The person who brought up point two? That\u2019s valid. Why wasn\u2019t I afraid of that before? Point six, too.\u2019 I went there with one fear and left with three. All that did was cost me a lot of time, stress and money.\u201d Fritsch has not set foot on a plane since 2013. He is perfectly at peace with that, saying that being alone with one\u2019s thoughts for long spells in this age of smartphones is no bad thing. It helps that he is, by his own admission, \u201ctalkative and analytical\u201d by nature. But what do fellow golfers make of this life? \u201cA bunch of people are sceptical,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t imagine being in this profession and not flying. Others have come up to me and said: \u2018I\u2019m afraid as well. I don\u2019t want to mention anything in case it damages my image or sponsorship options.\u2019 Then there are a lot of people who are simply quite interested in my story.\u201d Fritsch is 104th on the Race to Dubai, with the top 110 guaranteed full exemption for 2017. A tie for seventh at the Dunhill Links Championship this month suddenly enhanced his claim. \u201cIt is two-sided emotion,\u201d he says. \u201cSix weeks ago I was nowhere, I didn\u2019t even have a decent standing on the Challenge Tour for next season. To be where I am now, that has definitely bumped up my mood. The other side is that pressure, you feel like you have something to lose. That burden is something I have to try to withstand.\u201d Not that he is busy with permutations. \u201cYou would need to go to university and study mathematics to work that out,\u201d Fritsch says with a laugh. \u201cHonestly, with the amount of people you have to consider, the amount of money you have to divide an unknown number of ways, then you have to concentrate on your own performance and how that may go. You\u2019d have to be at least a university junior to produce accurate numbers. I would rather spend more time playing video games. Rankings and points systems are one good way to keep people in jobs.\u201d Fritsch would have a long discussion with his family if the point ever came where he was eligible for the PGA Tour and had a life-changing decision to make. For now, his ambition lies in establishing himself as a consistent European Tour performer. \u201cI have other interests. People who say they will give up absolutely everything to be the best? That isn\u2019t me.

In a new frontline in the battle against the capital\u2019s gentrification, housing giant Berkeley Homes has applied for planning permission to demolish studios on a former gas works site in Fulham in southwest London, which is currently used by more than 200 businesses in the creative industries. Tenants opposed to what they describe as a Dubai-style development of blocks rising to 27 storeys include one of the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s favourite fashion designers, Pepa Gonzalez, who has made clothes for Prince George and Princess Charlotte; and Julius Schoonhoven, a leading clockmaker who works for the National Trust and the Royal Palaces. The affected businesses include fine artists, architects and designers and have a combined multi-million pound turnover.    Related: The bubble that turned into a tide: how London got hooked on gentrification    The dispute is set to test a manifesto promise made in May by London mayor Sadiq Khan to \u201cprotect London\u2019s workspaces and venues threatened by encroaching development\u201d. The plans are set to go before the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham\u2019s planning committee in the coming months and Khan\u2019s spokesman said it would \u201cinappropriate to comment while this is still a live case\u201d. The threat to the studios is not an isolated case. Between 2014 and 2019, 3,500 artists were predicted to lose their places of work in London \u2013 a 30% cut, according to a report by the Greater London Authority. The temptation to replace them with private housing is strong for developers. The artists pay as little as \u00a3500 a month in rent, but Berkeley Homes is currently selling three bedroom apartments for \u00a36m at a neighbouring site, Chelsea Creek. The housebuilder\u2019s founder and chairman, Tony Pidgley, earned \u00a321.5m last year.  But on a visit by the Guardian this week, the tenants argued they form a vital part of London\u2019s creative industries sector, which provides one in eight jobs in London. Fashion designers described how they manufacture clothes in other parts of the capital while fine art and furniture restorers said they worked for Sotheby\u2019s and major galleries. They are likely to face eviction next year.     Pepa Gonzalez, a Spanish fashion designer in her studio at The Old Gas Works. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian    \u201cWe are skilled artisans, gilders, clockmakers and proper creative industries,\u201d said Francesca Sanders, a wildlife artist and part of the Old Gasworks creative enterprise committee opposing the housing scheme. \u201cWe are not a load of school kids.\u201d However, Berkeley said its plans would bring a site largely occupied by redundant gasholders back into use and provide \u201cmuch needed homes for London\u201d. The tenants\u2019 committee has complained to Berkeley, which is proposing the redevelopment in a joint venture with National Grid, that its demolition plans are \u201cbaffling\u201d. They say they have been offered no alternative accommodation. \u201cThe array of British heritage brands and crafts housed here are not only a vital asset to the neighbourhood and London more broadly, but also a very obvious goldmine for any future development,\u201d they wrote in a letter also sent to the Prince of Wales, whose support they are hoping to win for their campaign. At least two of the threatened tenants are backed by the Prince\u2019s Trust. \u201cThis is awful,\u201d said Gonzalez, originally from Spain, whose business started booming recently when Prince George was pictured on the cover of Hello! Magazine wearing one of her outfits. \u201cWe need places like this to help London grow. One person will get rich by selling all these apartments but what happens to everybody here? This place is full of expertise. There are painters, photographers, clothes from Africa, Spain. This is London. It is the whole world.\u201d     Julius Schoonhoven, an antique clock fixer, in The Old Gas Works. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian    \u201cWe are trying to convince them to keep us as part of the development because this could be a huge asset,\u201d said Johnny de Ath, a musician and composer who has been based at the complex for 12 years. \u201cOnce you have the arts scene, the rest follows. If this doing and making is all pushed out we have a big problem for the creative industries in this city.\u201d A spokesman for St William, the name of the joint venture company, said: \u201cWe are in touch with local businesses as part of our engagement with the local community regarding the proposals to redevelop Fulham Gasworks. We have submitted a planning application for up to 1,375 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes, 103,000 sq ft of commercial space, including the refurbishment of two listed buildings and a new public park providing 2.5 acres of open public space.\u201d He said the site was \u201cextremely complex\u201d because of the gas infrastructure and said it had to balance competing requirements including affordable housing and the restoration of some listed buildings. Last month, City Hall planners warned the project does not yet comply with some London-wide planning policies. They called on St William to commit to providing replacement cultural and employment uses including affordable workspace and complained there was no affordable housing offer which was \u201ca significant concern\u201d. St William said it has submitted a viability assessment regarding affordable housing, although this remains confidential. It also said the application included space that could be used for small businesses and galleries.     The Old Gas Works in Chelsea, London, which Berkeley Homes wants to redevelop.

Robert Doran was jailed for four and a half years in 2012 for bankrolling a large-scale cigarette smuggling operation. The Dubai-based businessman was ordered to pay \u00a31.45m, which he then claimed was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and breached the European convention on human rights. But in March 2015 the court of appeal rejected his case against the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s proceeds of crime unit. The judges imposed a new confiscation order of nearly \u00a34.4m \u2013 the total benefit of the criminal enterprise \u2013 plus interest of \u00a3200,000. The decision was upheld by the supreme court last year. HMRC, working jointly with the CPS, secured a restraint order to help force Doran, 51, to part with the land in Dartford \u2013 his main asset in the UK. The holding was sold this month. The order was the result of a lengthy HMRC investigation that revealed a complex web of companies, ownerships and leases to confirm that Doran, who lived in a Dubai apartment worth millions and drove sports cars, owned the land. David Cowie, the assistant director of HMRC\u2019s fraud investigation service, said: \u201cHis brazen attempts to have the confiscation order quashed backfired spectacularly. Doran lived the high life in Dubai but has already spent years behind British bars. HMRC and our partner agencies will work together to strip criminals of the proceeds of their crimes.\u201d Lorraine Lally, a prosecutor in the CPS proceeds of crime unit, said Doran had spent years trying to avoid paying what he owed the taxpayer. \u201cFraudsters need to realise that we will go further than just imprisonment. If convicted, we can and will track down and confiscate the proceeds of their crimes,\u201d she said. Doran and his accomplice, Patrick Gray, supplied the finance for the smuggling operation. The pair were also involved in the purchase, packaging and shipment of the cigarettes. The crime was discovered after documents were examined from two freight containers that arrived at the Port of Felixstowe.

Gloria Macleod, whose husband Robert grew up in Dingwall and now works in Dubai, was denied entry to the UK at Inverness airport in September, despite holding a valid visa. The couple have two daughters, who are British citizens.  Her passport was confiscated and she was threatened with deportation within days, facing the prospect of leaving Siobhan, 11, and 10-year-old Meaghan in the care of their elderly grandparents. Macleod\u2019s local MP, Ian Blackford, described the visa dispute as \u201cmadness\u201d. Only a month ago, Blackford had celebrated with another family of constituents, the Brains, who were granted leave to remain after fighting since April against deportation to Australia. Gloria\u2019s husband, Robert, whom she married in 2003, is a former Royal Regiment of Scotland lance corporal. The family, who had been living in Dubai, where Robert works as a security manager, returned to Dingwall in July, where Siobhan and Meaghan enrolled in the same primary school attended by seven-year-old Lachlan Brain. Although Gloria, an Indian passport holder, possessed a UK C-Visit passport, which is valid for 10 years, the couple decided that she should apply for permanent residence to allow her to remain in Scotland while the girls attended school and Robert continued working in Dubai. After advice from the visa office in Dubai, acting on behalf of the UK immigration service, that her application had to be made in person, Gloria briefly left the UK to complete her application process. But when she returned she was denied entry.  After Blackford\u2019s intervention, Macleod was given a stay of removal until the UK immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, formally responded to the SNP MP\u2019s inquiry about the case, and the Home Office have now granted her a 30-month visa. Macleod described herself as \u201cdelighted\u201d, adding: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the quick turnaround from the Home Office in issuing my visa and appreciate the help from everyone involved.\u201d  Blackford said: \u201cThis has been a huge trauma for the family. Gloria already had a visa that gave her the right to be in Dingwall when immigration officials sought to remove her right to reenter the country. The good news is that the Home Office has now given longer leave to remain and the family can get back to normal life.

Wasn\u2019t this phenomenon, he speculated, \u201canother facet of the recline [sic] and fall of the West\u201d? If so, then perhaps innovation in music and sound, together with the spirit of \u201crebel yell\u201d, was now more likely to emerge from China, Africa and Latin America \u2013 parts of the global south where \u201cpopular energies and desires will be stoked that come into friction with existing political structures and social norms, producing sparks and possibly conflagrations\u201d. One of the people best placed to cast more light on these tantalising vistas is Jace Clayton, otherwise known as DJ /rupture and once described by the influential music magazine Wire as a \u201cpan-global, post-everything superhero \u201d. In his DJ sets and on his popular Mudd Up! show on the American WFMU radio station, he routinely meshed Jamaican dub, Japanese noise, south London jungle and Egyptian mahraganat \u2013 electronic music born of Cairo\u2019s slums. Harvard-educated, a writer for art journals such as Bidoun and Frieze, he\u2019s also responsible for conceptual art projects such as Sufi Plug Ins, for which he created a series of programs that readjusted and retuned western sounds according to north African quarter-tone scales. Essentially, the goal was to orientalise the technology of late capitalism. Uproot, his first book, is a meditation on how sounds are made, circulated and used by people around the world. It also chronicles an era at the beginning of the 21st century when the ecology of music \u2013 the material on which it was pressed, the shops where it was sold, the money made by its creators \u2013 had become mostly nonexistent. But Clayton was too young to spend all his time bemoaning past epochs; he self-released a frenetically polycultural mixtape, Gold Teeth Thief (2003), made it freely available online, and parlayed the attention it received into a still-intense schedule of air-mile-racking DJ sets. The book is a travelogue of sorts. Here he is in Zagreb, Dubai and Osaka. Here he is in Lebanon using Bluetooth to grab some of the tunes his Adidas-tracksuited cabbie is playing on his mobile phone. Here he is in Monterrey, north-east Mexico, going past emo kids and reggaeton fans on his way to hear thundering tribal guarachero played by a DJ behind whom is projected a Harry Potter movie. And here he is in Kingston where he is gobsmacked to hear George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d dropped by dancehall DJs. Among the Berbers in Morocco, he hangs out with local singers, listening to them make showy use of Auto-Tune, the audio processor that shifts pitches \u2013 made famous by Cher in her single \u201cBelieve\u201d. He ponders the popularity of Whitney Houston-style melisma across the Maghreb, from \u201cbawdy folksingers whose throats have been burned by a lifetime of whisky, to honey-voiced Koranic reciters, who \u2018sing\u2019 the Koran magnificently yet consider all music to be sinful\u201d. In places like these, there is groove and grit, tradition and reinvention. (Closer to home, in Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park, an especially well-textured section of the book concerns the Mexican sound-system parties he attends.) Clayton isn\u2019t looking for undiscovered music or acoustic authenticity; today, he argues, physical instruments and spaces to rehearse, along with dexterity, technique and muscle memory, are less important than computer access, \u201calthough, in a pinch, a PlayStation or smartphone will do\u201d. Rather, he\u2019s fascinated by \u201caudio terroir\u201d, the ways in which environments \u2013 even tough, unprepossessing ones \u2013 can gestate and nurture novel sounds. Enemies of promise are often lurking. DJs and producers scour the planet looking to extract resources from previously untapped areas, plundering emergent scenes for grabby rhythms and samples. In one excellent riff, Clayton contrasts the daring, almost violent collage techniques of 1920s dadaists and Soviet montagists with the \u201cboring, tidy, toothless\u201d ways in which the copy, cut and paste functions on a keyboard allow data to be moved around a screen today. Even more insidious are the sports and soft drinks companies that increasingly seek to forge brand-enhancing relationships with \u201cunderground\u201d culture. \u201cOur sounds and struggles activate their environs as places of heightened meaning.\u201d Uproot is witty and nuanced rather than sloganeering, and shot through with the immersive research and hard\u2011earned access to key, sometimes evasive, figures that would be the envy of any Ivy League anthropologist. But Clayton is at his most suggestive when, true to his title, he discusses the relationship between the movement of sounds and of migrant bodies. In Barcelona he has a friend, Mark, an undocumented African musician who lives out a kind of \u201cMediterranean gothic\u201d, squatting in an ex\u2019s apartment, unable to use electric lights after dark for fear of alerting others to his presence. In Casablanca, he heads to a market where the \u201cinorganic tang of injection-molded plastics off-gassing complex, probably carcinogenic, polymer molecules mingles with sweat and diesel exhaust\u201d. Here, as in much of the world, he says, the sellers of cheap, Chinese-run, factory-produced plastic are also the sellers of bootleg, MP3-stuffed CDs. Indeed, when Clayton talks about techniques such as transcoding and compressing \u2013 the art of squeezing recorded music into easily exportable and copyable packets of data \u2013 he could almost be talking about the journeys of refugees and migrants: \u201cThis is the sound of files that have survived patchy connections and erroneous metadata, straddling pirate servers and shaky Bluetooth transfers and YouTube rips, evading spam filters en route to Russian wares sites, to end up on a desktop or in some web video accompanied by an equally messed-up JPeg.\u201d Foreign sounds, like foreigners themselves, invade. But Clayton, like many club goers, embraces the idea of music as a zone of mutation and adaptation, of new rhythms as thrillingly contagious, of the dancefloor as a place of both affirming and redefining community. \u2022 Uproot is published by FSG Originals.", "title": "Uproot by Jace Clayton review \u2013 exploring a world of sound with DJ /rupture", "sentences": ["Here he is in Zagreb, Dubai and Osaka."], "publicationDate": "2016-10-27T12:00:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/27/horse-racing-tips-friday-28-october", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Newcastle 4.40 Miss Tree 5.10 Bassett Bleu 5.45 Mojito 6.15 Eponina 6.45 Dark Side Dream 7.15 Initially 7.45 Alice Thornton 8.15 Caesar The Gaesar Newmarket 1.20 Elyaasaat 1.50 Loujain 2.25 Charismatic Man (nap) 3.00 Easy Victory 3.35 Dubai One 4.10 Hestina (nb) 4.45 Trevisani 5.15 Tomahawk Kid Uttoxeter 2.00 La Bague Au Roi 2.35 One Forty Seven 3.10 Wistari Rocks 3.45 Charbel 4.20 Lemon\u2019s Gent 4.50 Very Extravagant Wetherby 2.10 Clondaw Cracker 2.45 Hadfield 3.20 Abricot De L\u2019Oasis 3.55 Cliffs Of Dover 4.30 Queen\u2019s Bay 5.00 Star Trouper", "title": "Horse racing tips: Friday 28 October", "sentences": ["Newcastle 4.40 Miss Tree 5.10 Bassett Bleu 5.45 Mojito 6.15 Eponina 6.45 Dark Side Dream 7.15 Initially 7.45 Alice Thornton 8.15 Caesar The Gaesar Newmarket 1.20 Elyaasaat 1.50 Loujain 2.25 Charismatic Man (nap) 3.00 Easy Victory 3.35 Dubai One 4.10 Hestina (nb) 4.45 Trevisani 5.15 Tomahawk Kid Uttoxeter 2.00 La Bague Au Roi 2.35 One Forty Seven 3.10 Wistari Rocks 3.45 Charbel 4.20 Lemon\u2019s Gent 4.50 Very Extravagant Wetherby 2.10 Clondaw Cracker 2.45 Hadfield 3.20 Abricot De L\u2019Oasis 3.55 Cliffs Of Dover 4.30 Queen\u2019s Bay 5.00 Star Trouper"], "publicationDate": "2016-10-27T16:46:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/27/english-cricketers-union-pakistan-super-league-advice-lahore-final-security", "tags": ["Cricket", "England cricket team", "Sport"], "article": "A number of high-profile English cricketers are set to go against the advice of their union if they are called on to participate in the final of the Pakistan Super League, which is scheduled to take place in Lahore. There are heightened security fears in the country in the wake of the Quetta terrorist attack on Tuesday.   Related: England\u2019s Jos Buttler and the trouble keeping on top of your game as a gopher | Vic Marks    Ten English players have been drafted for the 2017 competition, which will largely be staged in Dubai before the final takes place in Pakistan. Although the England and Wales Cricket Board will grant the players No Objection Certificates, the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association, in conjunction with the Federation of International Cricketers\u2019 Association, has strongly advised them not to go to Lahore. The PCA has said the situation in Pakistan \u201cpresents an unacceptably high security risk and remains unmanageable\u201d. It is understood that the players, including Luke Wright, who is due to play for Quetta Gladiators alongside Kevin Pietersen, Tymal Mills and David Willey, are happy to compete in Pakistan should their team reach the final. Those considering playing in the final have been encouraged to ensure their insurance coverage is in place and were reminded they travel as individuals and at their own risk. Seventy English players entered the competition\u2019s draft, with those successful including Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan, both of whom pulled out of the tour of Bangladesh over security concerns. However, it is likely that they and other England white-ball regulars would not be involved in the Lahore final on 9 March as the national team arrive in the Caribbean for a three-match ODI tour on 22 February, rendering them unavailable. Sam Billings, Ben Duckett and Willey are others playing in the PSL who are likely to tour the West Indies. However, Wright, Mills and Jade Dernbach, who hopes to be selected as an injury replacement having not been picked in the draft, are understood to be relaxed about travelling to Pakistan. English players have not yet been sent the paperwork for the competition, so do not know if skipping the Lahore final would amount to a breach of it. There have been suggestions the final could be moved from Lahore but Najam Sethi, the PSL chairman, said at the draft on 19 October: \u201cInternational players know what we can do; most of them are ready to come to Pakistan and play. We have signed players with a condition that, if their team reaches the final, they will have to go to Lahore and they have all agreed. The government has promised to give full security to the players. We are convinced that the final will happen in Lahore.\u201d Fifty-nine people were killed in the Pakistan city Quetta on Tuesday when terrorists stormed a police training academy. Pakistan have been cricketing nomads \u2013 playing their home fixtures in the UAE \u2013 since the Sri Lanka team bus was shot at in Lahore in 2009. The ECB\u2019s stance on the PSL is the same as its view on next month\u2019s Bangladesh Premier League, in which a number of players \u2013 including the T20 specialist Mills \u2013 are also playing against PCA advice. England have been granted protection on tour in Bangladesh that is without precedent and the PCA believes that players could not be guaranteed the same security at the BPL. The hitherto smooth passage of England\u2019s visit has brought the prospect of an Australia tour of Bangladesh a step closer. Australia cancelled a tour last year because of security concerns (and also did not send a team to this year\u2019s Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh) but Cricket Australia\u2019s head of security, Sean Carroll, has travelled to Dhaka for the second Test to scope the prospect of a tour next August. The BCB CEO, Nizamuddin Chowdhury, welcomed Carroll\u2019s visit, saying: \u201cIt is certainly an encouraging sign as it shows that they are keen to have a look at our security arrangements and are positive about coming in August next year.\u201d Carroll will look at the security measures put in place \u2013 in terms of accommodation and transport via convoy \u2013 by the Bangladesh government, BCB and Reg Dickason, the ECB\u2019s security adviser.", "title": "English cricketers set to go against union\u2019s Pakistan Super League advice", "sentences": ["Related: England\u2019s Jos Buttler and the trouble keeping on top of your game as a gopher | Vic Marks    Ten English players have been drafted for the 2017 competition, which will largely be staged in Dubai before the final takes place in Pakistan."], "publicationDate": "2016-10-27T18:24:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/29/iran-holiday-guide-tehran-isfahan-persepolis-yazd", "tags": ["Iran holidays", "Adventure travel", "Cultural trips", "Heritage", "Middle East holidays", "Travel"], "article": "My beloved British friends! It has been 25 years since I threw that goodbye party in Brixton, complete with saffron-laden rice dishes, to bid you farewell before I returned to Iran. You were the cast of my life from the day I arrived as a homesick 12-year-old. From schoolgirl, to undergraduate, to Londoner, you were at my side. Yet, in a quarter-century, none of you has accepted my offer of coming to visit me here. The image of Iran is so calcified by its politics that not even one of your own could persuade you to come and explore for yourself. This is my last-ditch invitation: maybe you\u2019ll get over that psychological hurdle and catch the six-hour flight to Tehran. You will need to organise a visa and travel through a tour operator though, since Britons can\u2019t get a visa at the door, unlike many other nationalities. But that is easily done, so many Britons and Americans are visiting these days \u2013 and from Monday British Airways has daily flights to Tehran from London.   Iran holiday guide map. Map for Haleh\u2019s journey (and Yasmin Khan\u2019s foodie tour).   We can\u2019t possibly see everything Iran has to offer in one visit, but let me take you south to the cities of central Iran, veering off the tourist map here and there. By the way, in answer to that one girlfriend who keeps saying she doesn\u2019t want to wear \u201cthe black thing,\u201d you don\u2019t have to wear a chador; not everyone does. But women visitors will need a mid-length coat, and a light cotton scarf to hang loosely over their hair. And since there won\u2019t be any booze, you can use the time to detox; there\u2019s plenty of superb food, especially fruit and nuts, to compensate for the lack of calories from alcohol. Tehran     A mural outside the former US embassy in Tehran. Photograph: Alamy    The capital. This is where you\u2019ll get a chance to see, first-hand, the Iran you know from news bulletins. The wall murals often seen in stock media images are a great way to step into the recent history of the place. They lionise revolutionary leaders and, more poignantly, memorialise martyrs of the eight-year war with Iraq. Almost every street is named after someone lost in that war. The murals provide an insight into the country\u2019s priorities: from the zeal of early revolution and war to the contemporary penchant for the decorative. The walls of the US embassy, now officially referred to as \u201cthe nest of spies\u201d, will provide selfie backdrops to shake your Instagram feed. Having explored the political veneer of the city, we\u2019ll head to Golestan Palace in the heart of old Tehran. Here, Nassereddin Shah, the 19th-century Qajar king, introduced photography to Iran and practised his hobby taking pictures of the moustachioed women of his harem. The palace has an impressive archive of Iranian photography, thanks to him.     Golestan Palace, Tehran. Photograph: Alamy    By now you\u2019ll be hungry, so we\u2019ll take a short walk to the entrance of the Grand Bazaar, the bustling hub of commercial activity. You can find almost anything here, but we are stopping for the famous lunch at Moslem restaurant. We\u2019ll queue to get into this congested delight, but it\u2019s worth it: it serves the best tah-chin in town. Portions of saffron and yogurt rice, served with chicken and barberries, easily feed two Iranians \u2013 and we know how to eat! Moving on, we will go find Tehran\u2019s buzzing art scene, where the young and the hip spend Friday afternoons gallery-hopping. New galleries around town are helping regenerate the old centre of Tehran: these include Aaran Gallery (12 Dey Street) which showcases work by young Iranian artists. As we head north, we\u2019ll pop into Ag Gallery (3 Peysan Street) for photography, via Dastan\u2019s Basement (6 Bidar Street) a bijou gallery where the art is still affordable. Perhaps we\u2019ll grab a Persian herbal infusion in one of the many new coffee shops, as the apr\u00e8s art scene requires \u2013 you won\u2019t see a Starbucks or McDonald\u2019s while you\u2019re here. Now, there\u2019s an incentive. Kashan     Manouchehri House, a boutique hotel in Kashan    Many Iranians like to go north to take in the Caspian Sea\u2019s lush vegetation and humid climate. But most foreign visitors go south to see the historic cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. We\u2019ll start in Kashan, the gateway city to the central desert region and will stay at Manouchehri House (doubles from \u00a370), a 19th-century property, now a boutique hotel, renovated even as the country was experiencing the worst of the sanctions. When many people were thinking of leaving, the owner raised this house from a heap of dust and rubble. We all thought she was crazy but, these days, booking in advance is necessary to enjoy a night in what is now an admired example of architectural renovation. Tehranis, tired of the crowds and the villas that have mushroomed in the Caspian region, now run to the desert to buy and rebuild abandoned homes.     Fin Garden. Photograph: Alamy    In Kashan we\u2019ll also visit the Agha Bozorgi seminary, the only mosque in Iran with a sunken garden. Before we turn away from the city, we\u2019ll visit Fin Garden too, which had the dubious honour of housing Amir Kabir, one of Iran\u2019s modernising prime ministers in exile. He was killed in the bath house. To lighten the mood, we\u2019ll grab a kebab, sitting on beds alfresco, at Gholam\u2019s Kebab House before hitting the motorway towards Yazd. On the way to Yazd     Aghda old town. Photograph: Haleh Anvari      We\u2019ll stop at Aghda, famous for its pomegranates, where the old town has been abandoned in favour of modern housing    There can be stops at any town that takes your fancy as we travel along the edge of Dasht-e Kavir, one of Iran\u2019s two central deserts. There are significant historical sites in Natanz, Naeen and Ardestan, the latter home to a mosque built on the remains of a Zoroastrian fire temple dating from 1158. There\u2019s also the Moon Qanat, an ancient double-tier aqueduct. The underground irrigation system associated with it dates from 1,000BC, and is an early technological wonder that brought water to Persia\u2019s many arid cities, employing a system of underground wells and canals. It\u2019s a long journey, so we\u2019ll stop for the night at Aghda, famous for its pomegranates, where the old town has been abandoned in favour of modern housing. The mainly uninhabited neighbourhood makes for an evocative stroll. One of the larger houses has been restored as the cosy Khaloo Mirza hotel (doubles from \u00a325). Here, we\u2019ll sleep on floor mats in shared rooms, traditional Iranian style. Food is provided by the hotelier\u2019s aunt from a large kitchen, and it will no doubt include Aghda\u2019s superb pomegranate paste. Camping in Dashte E Kavir     Kavir-e Lut desert. Photograph: Brian A Vikander/Getty Images    Before getting to Yazd, we\u2019ll make a detour to join an off-road group to camp amid the desert dunes, where the landscape is spectacular and the unexpected flora otherworldly. This vast landscape is not a place to go on your own, so we\u2019ll join Hamid Boreiri, who has been leading groups on desert excursions for 19 years (zistnc.com). Everyone brings their own 4WD vehicle (spare seats are shared around). We\u2019ll help dig the car out of soft sand as we traverse the dunes, and pitch camp ourselves \u2013 it\u2019s tents and sleeping bags here. Travellers report that they feel a surge of energy under the desert skies. Walking barefoot in the sand exfoliates your feet but it also cleanses the soul. You certainly come out of the desert feeling lighter. Maybe it\u2019s to do with the salt in the sand; these deserts were once seas. Maybe the feminine curves of the dunes suggest a softer place. That said, all that screaming as vehicles crest the dunes is cathartic! Yazd     Amir Chakhmagh. Photograph: Getty Images    To Yazd, the city of wind towers, which suck the hot desert air down on to a shallow pool of water and cool the house. One of these has been recreated in a wonderland mall in Dubai but here, in Dowlatabad Garden, we can see the tallest functioning wind tower in the world. No other city in Iran has been preserved so meticulously by its residents, who have resisted the lure of building the classical pastiche high-rises so beloved of the nouveau riche in Tehran.    Follow me to the Khalifa pastry shop and order its famed Yazdi delicacies of baghlava and sweetmeats to take back home    The city has strong associations with Iran\u2019s pre-Islamic religion. Zoroastrians gather annually at Chak Chak, a mountainside temple closed to Muslims. But we can visit a functioning fire temple in town and make the hike to the Towers of Silence where, until 70 years ago, bodies of dead Zoroastrians were left to be consumed by carrion birds. Follow me to the Khalifa pastry shop and order its famed Yazdi delicacies of baghlava and sweetmeats to take back home. Amir Chakhmagh, a three-storey structure known as a hosseinieh \u2013 for commemoration ceremonies \u2013 will bring us back to Iran\u2019s present Shia rituals. This is a place where the martyrdom of Imam Hossein is marked each year. The large wooden nakhl, representing a palm that carried his body, is dressed in black decorative cloth and used as the centrepiece for the mourning processions of Ashura every year. Rest will come at Khan restaurant, once a typical Iranian hammam, before we go to sample broad bean and dill rice with lamb at Talar Yazd restaurant. We\u2019ll stay in Moshirolmamalek hotel (doubles from \u00a3115 B&amp;B) with its own Persian garden on the edge of the city. Shiraz     A boy runs between pillars at the Vakil mosque in Shiraz. Photograph: Pascal Mannaerts/Barcroft Images    How can we not visit Shiraz, the garden of Iran and the heart of its poetic soul? Venerated poets Sa\u2019di and Hafez are buried here. Iranians use Hafez\u2019s mystic poetry for divinations, and visit his grave as if on a secular pilgrimage. Although we will have to dash to see all that is on offer here, dashing is not the Shirazi way. Whereas Isfahanis are famous for their quick wit and love of money, Shirazis are known for their appreciation of a gentler lifestyle centred on the city\u2019s many private and public gardens. The city has a fine selection of accessible Persian gardens, including Eram, Jahan-nama, and Delgosha, and the newly reopened Shapouri Pavilion Garden includes a new restaurant where we can take the weight off our feet.     Vakil bazaar. Photograph: Emad Aljumah/Getty Images    The city\u2019s sublime air, laced with the scent of orange blossom wafting from the many citrus orchards, is legendary. The Shirazi aromatic lime is indispensable to our cooking, and is served liberally with faloodeh, the local frozen noodle dessert. The Vakil bazaar is one of the most colourful in the country. The proximity of Shiraz to the homelands of nomadic tribes means the place is full of the bright, glittery fabrics favoured for traditional clothes. Not far from the bazaar is the Shahcheragh mausoleum, a Shia shrine with mirror-work decorations that have inspired contemporary artists including Monir Farmanfarmaian. Here, you do have to wear a chador \u2013 they are provided at the door and are not black. After a long day, perhaps we\u2019ll stay at the new Shiraz Grand Hotel (doubles from \u00a3130 B&amp;B) by Qur\u2019an Gate, an example of the new modern architecture that is popping up around Shiraz. Persepolis     Xerxes\u2019 Gateway, also known as the Gate of All Nations, at Persepolis. Photograph: Alamy    An hour\u2019s drive north-east of Shiraz is our portal to the ancient past. Persepolis, the ceremonial palace built by the Achaemenid king Darius in 518BC, was a significant site in the Persian empire. Our ancient history is sometimes lost in the noise of contemporary politics, but images and words from this era abound in our daily life, serving as the glue that binds the nation. The Achaemenids were expansionists and ruled more than 40% of the then known world, but the fact that the palace was built by hired hands and not slaves marks the Achaemenids as progressive for their time.    Our ancient history is often lost in the noise of contemporary politics but images from this era abound in daily life    As we will see, the surprisingly well-preserved bas-reliefs show guests from the many nations of the empire arriving at the palace bearing gifts. Among imposing statues of mythical animals are the well-known winged bulls, guardians of the palace. Sadly they didn\u2019t deter Alexander the Macedonian (who does not go by the title of \u201cGreat\u201d in this country) from burning the place down. Next morning, on our way to Isfahan, we\u2019ll stop at Pasargad, the Tomb of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian empire and the first king of Iranians. His sarcophagus stands without pomp on a windswept plain. In 1971, Mohammad Reza Shah held a huge ceremony to mark 2,500 years of monarchy in Iran. His famous words \u2013 \u201cCyrus sleep easy for we are awake\u201d \u2013 became the words of the last Iranian king to its first. The revolution followed eight years later. Isfahan     Mosque in Imam Square, Isfahan Iran. Photograph: Alamy    Isfahan should always be the last city on any travel itinerary in Iran. OK, I\u2019m biased (it is my home town) but this truly is the jewel in the crown. Most of what we\u2019ll see was built by Shah Abbas in the 17th century, when his capital was established here. The magnificent Naghshe Jahan Square, with its turquoise domes, and palace of Alighapou, positioned around an old polo field, are wondrous and you\u2019ll want to see them again and again. This is a living and working neighbourhood: Isfahanis still come to procure spices and jewellery in the old Gheisariyeh bazaar, and the surrounding passageways bustle with artisans making handicrafts. My favourite is the coppersmiths\u2019 passage, where the cacophony of beating hammers is a centuries-old sound. Another joy is the ceiling of the Lotfollah mosque. Here, the design of the tiles creates the same sensation as watching a starry night, drawing you upwards as if falling into the sky. Not far away is the Jameh mosque, one of the oldest in the country, rebuilt in the 11th century. No colourful tiles here: the wonder is in the patterns and craftsmanship of the brickworks.     Fine dining \u2026 the restaurant at the Abbasi hotel. Photograph: Abassi Hotel    Finally, a major feature of Isfahan is the river, along the banks of which Isfahanis go to take the air. There are a number of old bridges here, from the plain-brick Si-o-se pol with its 33 arches, to the Khaju bridge with its decorative motifs and tiles, where the king would sit to enjoy the sound of water falling over specially designed steps. Nowadays, the river runs dry most of the year, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Isfahanis continuing to use its banks in their leisure time. Staying in the Abbasi hotel (doubles from \u00a3130 B&amp;B) is a must. The old caravanserai has been converted into possibly the most beautiful hotel Iran has to offer. The quince-laden trees and the dome of the Chaharbagh seminary visible in the garden make this a magical end to your stay. But only if you come!

For Matsuyama, the 24-year-old from Japan, a three-week run has returned $2.7m and will ensure he is ranked sixth in the world.   Related: Sports quiz of the week: World Series, Carlos Alberto and the Ballon d'Or    Matsuyama\u2019s closing round of 66 at the WGC-HSBC Champions meant he cantered to a seven-stroke victory on 23 under par. In securing the biggest win of his career Matsuyama also became the first Asian winner of a World Golf Championship event. The hope, of course, is such a victory resonates positively for the game in that region. \u201cIt\u2019s a great victory for me,\u201d Matsuyama said. \u201cHopefully this will be a great victory for Japan and encourage others to play golf. I was actually surprised when they announced I was the first Asian to win a WGC. \u201cI really don\u2019t know why I played well this week. Over the last three years here I\u2019ve had to withdraw twice and I didn\u2019t play very well the other year.\u201d Matsuyama now has a major in his sights. \u201cWinning today I feel has got me closer to being able to compete a lot better in the major tournaments. So my next goal is, of course, to win a major and I\u2019m going to do all that I can to prepare well for that.\u201d In endorsing a stunning change of fortunes Matsuyama recorded 29 birdies and did not make a bogey over his closing 45 tournament holes. Henrik Stenson and Daniel Berger shared second, the Open champion closing out with a 65. As Matsuyama celebrated his win, Rory McIlroy confirmed he has withdrawn from the Turkish Airlines Open this week. Amid fears over security McIlroy answered: \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious,\u201d when asked why he will not participate in Turkey. Player unrest over the safety of the event has been known for some time, with regular promises made over the levels of security that will be on hand at the Regnum Carya Resort near Antalya. Clearly McIlroy has not been suitably convinced. The Northern Irishman added on Sunday that he had \u201cslept much better\u201d since removing his name from the entry list. This marks both a blow to the event itself, which had earlier lost Tiger Woods for different reasons, and to the European Tour as it looks to promote its end-of-season final series. The field for Turkey is now notably weak. \u201cWe respect all decisions made by our members in relation to competing in tournaments,\u201d a European Tour spokesperson said. Speculation on Sunday surrounded the potential for further players to withdraw, with Patrick Reed among those thought to be considering their options. The Ladies European Tour cancelled a tournament in Turkey in June and that was still a live option for the men\u2019s equivalent, which has a $7m prize fund, as recently as the end of last week. McIlroy\u2019s core status aside, his move is even more striking as it could cost him the chance to defend successfully the European Tour\u2019s order of merit, the Race to Dubai. With three events of the season left \u2013 of which McIlroy will play only one \u2013 he lies behind Stenson and Danny Willett in the rankings. \u201cThe fact I\u2019ve won the FedEx Cup this year and won the Race to Dubai before made the decision a little easier,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s out of my hands. \u201cI took the decision not to go to Turkey next week. Those boys can battle it out. If I have somewhat of a chance going into Dubai, that\u2019s great. If not, they\u2019ve had big wins over the course of the season.

The so-called \u201cLion of Rolls-Royce\u201d had been in charge for 15 years and overseen the expansion of one of Britain\u2019s best-known blue-chip companies into an engineering giant on the world stage. The firm that had made engines for Spitfires during the second world war had become a \u00a313bn leviathan. Yet, cracks in its carefully crafted corporate image were about to emerge. Exactly how it started is still unclear, but by December 2012, Rolls-Royce had put itself on red alert. It acknowledged, somewhat opaquely, that it had a problem \u2013 and the Serious Fraud Office said it was investigating. At first, the SFO focused on the company\u2019s activities in the emerging markets of India and China, but the list of jurisdictions was to grow. Before long, the SFO declared it had opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce.   Related: Rolls-Royce middlemen may have used bribes to land major contracts    In an unusual move, the company, which had conducted its own internal review of its business, made clear the seriousness of the situation. \u201cIt is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the company. We will cooperate fully,\u201d Rolls-Royce said. In an effort to get ahead of the problem, but in a way that underlined its predicament, the company appointed Lord Gold, a former head of litigation at City law firm Herbert Smith, to review Rolls-Royce\u2019s \u201ccompliance procedures\u201d. Four years since the first reports of potential problems, and three years since the SFO began its inquiry in earnest, the scale of the investigation has become apparent. The Guardian has established the SFO team is now 30-strong, and is being supported by so-called \u201cblockbuster funding\u201d \u2013 money from the Treasury to cover exceptional costs. \u201cIt soon became clear that it was multiple jurisdictions, across several strands of its business,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the inquiry. So what has happened in the past three years? The SFO has given little away and has only confirmed making two arrests. They happened in February 2014, when it emerged that two businessmen Sudhir Choudhrie and his son Bhanu were questioned as part of its wide-ranging investigation into the activities of Rolls-Royce.     Rolls-Royce staff working on the BR725 engine. Photograph: Rolls-Royce Deutschland/Rolls-Royce plc    Neither has been charged and a few months after the arrests, the two men had their bail conditions lifted, but the Guardian understands the SFO\u2019s inquiries are continuing. The early focus on the Choudhries has been intriguing \u2013 their lawyers said they had not and have never been middlemen for Rolls-Royce, nor paid bribes to government officials or acted as middlemen in defence deals. In short, they say they have done nothing wrong. So who are they? The Choudhries are among the wealthiest and best-known families in India. They have a wide range of business interests and have become familiar faces in political circles in the UK too. They are entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and have also been major donors to the Liberal Democrats. They and their extended families own a number of mansions in the heart of London\u2019s Belgravia. With such a high profile, they have not avoided scrutiny \u2013 or criticism.    Related: The 12 countries where suspicious activity linked to Rolls-Royce has been identified    In India, for instance, Sudhir Choudhrie was investigated in 2004 by India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) \u2013 the country\u2019s foremost law enforcement agency \u2013 over suspicions related to alleged payoffs to a company agent. Years later the investigation was dropped, with Choudhrie insisting he had been a victim of a plot to damage his reputation. His lawyers told the Guardian: \u201cSudhir Choudhrie was investigated but was never arrested. He was subsequently cleared of all allegations of wrongdoing and the investigation as a whole was closed in 2011.\u201d In a closure report filed in a Delhi court that year, the CBI stated it did not find any evidence to suggest there was any payoff to Choudhrie or his companies.  A list compiled and disseminated by the CBI names Sudhir Choudhrie as one of 23 \u201cunscrupulous persons\u201d on a list of \u201cundesirable contact men\u201d. The list, which has been seen by the Guardian, is undated but is understood to still be in circulation in the Indian government. Choudhrie has challenged its authenticity. His lawyers say that although he has been made aware of it, he has no knowledge of its content and has never been contacted about it by any official body.  Separately from their alleged interaction with Rolls-Royce, there have been other occasions when the family\u2019s finances have raised concerns. One Swiss banking source has described to the Guardian and BBC how money transfers between the Choudhrie family group\u2019s companies sparked an anti-money laundering alert at Clariden Leu, which was then a private banking division of Credit Suisse. The Guardian has seen a report created by the risk management team at Clariden Leu in October 2008, which highlights the flow of vast sums that triggered the inquiry. The report analysed 18 \u201caccount relationships\u201d and looked at money transfers between companies owned or managed by members of Bhanu Choudhrie\u2019s extended family. One was Belinea Services Limited, which received \u20ac37,200,000 (\u00a333,400,000) from Rosoboronexport State Corporation, the Russian state\u2019s arms dealership. Bhanu Choudhrie was a director of Belinea.     Visitors at the Rosoboronexport stand at the 2015 Dubai Airshow. Photograph: TASS / Barcroft Media    In the year leading up to the report, another company, the Seychelles-registered Cottage Consultants, received \u20ac28,100,000 from Rosoboronexport and transferred \u20ac22,700,000 to an Isle of Man bank. On company documents, Bhanu Choudhrie is described as the \u201cfirst and sole director\u201d of Cottage Consultants. The company is owned through bearer shares, which means it is owned by whoever physically holds the share certificates. Bhanu Choudhrie has denied being a beneficial owner of the company.  Cottage Consultants had also received \u20ac9,700,000 from an entity called \u201cABC\u201d, with the money originating from Vnesheconombank, a now-sanctioned Moscow bank.   The Guardian asked Bhanu Choudhrie about the transfers that had alerted Clariden Leu. His lawyers said he had no knowledge of the internal report and any suggestion that these payments were improper or illegal was false and defamatory. The twists and turns of the Choudhries\u2019 business empire have rarely been out of the news in recent years, but it is their apparent knowledge of the bureaucracy and red tape in their home country \u2013 and how best to navigate it \u2013 that might make them seem ideal middlemen for any company hoping to break into the lucrative Indian market. One such firm is alleged to have been Rolls-Royce. The firm was involved in the the massive \u2013 and massively complicated \u2013 Hawk deal, which involved India buying Rolls-Royce engines and BAE-produced planes. A first tranche of this was agreed in 2004, a second in 2010. The total value of all the contracts involved came to \u00a32.1bn.   Related: Why the Rolls-Royce investigation is so important to the SFO    The parts were assembled at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, an Indian state-owned aerospace and defence firm, where Sudhir Choudhrie\u2019s uncle had been the chairman. The Guardian has spoken to one Rolls-Royce source. The source said the Choudhries and their companies had worked with the firm during this period. \u201cYou had to work your way and it took time,\u201d said the Rolls-Royce source. \u201cWe needed to have Indian partners or a sister company in India.\u201d The source said local fixers would help arrange the deal, before senior Rolls-Royce figures arrived to complete it.  The Guardian and the BBC understand that millions of pounds of Rolls-Royce money went to the Choudhrie family.  Even if this were true, it does not mean there has been any wrongdoing. Using middlemen is not illegal, so long as they abide by the rules. The Guardian asked the Choudhries to explain what role, if any, they \u2013 or their companies \u2013 had played in the Hawk deals. Lawyers for the Choudhries said they had not been middlemen or intermediaries and that any allegation that Rolls-Royce had paid them for the purpose of securing deals in India was untrue. The Guardian has been told about a curious meeting between Bhanu Choudhrie and a British businessman.  It came from a banking source who spoke to the Guardian. The source alleged that Bhanu Choudhrie and a former BAE executive called Peter Ginger visited Geneva together in 2007. Ginger was BAE\u2019s president in India until 2005. The Guardian has been told that during this trip, Ginger allegedly deposited hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash into a Clariden Leu account from another account he held.  By 2009, the account, which was called No 120467 Portsmouth, held about 1m Swiss francs. The Guardian has seen a copy of a bank document that shows the details of the Portsmouth account. Separately, documents discovered among the Panama Papers \u2013 the investigation into the Mossack Fonseca law firm carried out by the Guardian, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung \u2013 also reveal the family of Peter Ginger asking for a payment from an educational foundation with an apparent link to Bhanu Choudhrie.     The Mossack Fonseca law firm sign in Panama City. Photograph: Carlos Jasso / Reuters/Reuters    An email seen by the Guardian shows the Panamanian foundation paid to cover the university costs of one of Ginger\u2019s relatives. In one email, a member of the family requested money from the foundation to pay an allowance. \u201c[\u2026] is now back in [university ] for the summer term so we would be most grateful for payment to the same account as before,\u201d he wrote. He added: \u201cI hope this is in order and meets with [the] foundation council\u2019s approval. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me or [\u2026] if you have any questions.\u201d The payment was for \u00a3540 for four weeks of \u201cfood and subsistence\u201d. We asked Ginger and Choudrie to explain these apparent interactions. Is there a benign explanation? Could the banking source in Geneva have got it wrong? Lawyers for Bhanu Choudhrie insist he has. \u201cOur client has no knowledge of what bank accounts have been set up or operated by Mr Ginger or what sums (if any) he has deposited in them in cash. Mr Choudhrie did not pay any bribe to Mr Ginger.\u201d They added: \u201cOur client has no knowledge of any payments made [by the Foundation].\u201d The Guardian asked Ginger why he visited Geneva with Bhanu Choudhrie, and why the Panamanian foundation was funding his relative\u2019s education. He declined to comment on the allegations: \u201cI am not prepared to talk about it at all. I\u2019m not going to respond to the media at all.\u201d BAE Systems said it had \u201cno record indicating that Mr Ginger had a personal financial relationship with Mr Choudhrie during the period that Mr Ginger was employed by the Company\u201d. The episode may be nothing more than an intriguing vignette, but the SFO may have an opportunity to judge for itself. The source, who asked not to be named, has offered to speak to the SFO\u2019s investigators. The Choudhries had to wait seven years to be cleared after Indian authorities launched an inquiry \u2013 the SFO has been looking at them, and at Rolls-Royce, for a mere three. And the investigation appears to be broadening even now.  Panorama: Rolls-Royce will be broadcast on BBC1 at 8.30pm on Monday 31 October.

Professional punters do not go near the Cup The 156th running of \u201cthe race that stops a nation\u201d, a national day of punting and good cheer, and one of the great fun days on the Australian punt-drinking calendar, is upon us. And just about every one of us will gamble upon the race, with estimates that upwards of $800m will be spent, which is rather a lot when you sit down to think about it.   Related: 'Short but good': no rain on Melbourne Cup's parade    And yet professional punters \u2013 those gamblers who represent less than 1% of all gamblers because they actually \u201cwin\u201d betting on horses \u2013 won\u2019t go near the Cup. There are too many horses (24) in the race, too many variables, too much \u201cform\u201d both here and overseas which could mean anything. And too many of the horses are very good because they come from everywhere to run, in part down to the prestige of the race, but also due to the pot of $6.2m that is up for grabs.  2. Racing is not always romantic Jockey Michelle Payne won the race last year aboard the 100-1 outsider Prince of Penzance, the first woman in history to win the Melbourne Cup. And she was everywhere, the \u201cyou-go-girl\u201d of Australian sport. Twelve months down the track, there is one woman riding in the 24-horse field, Katelyn Mallyon aboard a 50-1 shot, Assign. Payne doesn\u2019t have a ride this year for a variety of reasons, not all sexist though.  Last year Payne had barely hopped off her mount before she criticised some of the horse\u2019s owners because they didn\u2019t want to give her the ride. She sledged these people, effectively her employers, publicly, on national television, using the stage of Flemington on Cup day to vent her spleen. And whatever the merits of her argument \u2013 and there were many \u2013 Payne will watch from wherever she watches in part because of that. Nor will Prince of Penzance defend the title because he injured a leg early October. It\u2019s not always a romantic game, thoroughbred horse racing.  3. The Sheikh\u2019s year? On the website of the all-powerful Godolphin Stables it says his highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum founded the company \u201cas an expression of his lifelong passion for horses and racing\u201d, which would be true. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be for money.  He\u2019s the Emir of Dubai and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and would have more money than everyone combined at Flemington on Tuesday. And yet, despite his vast wealth, the Sheikh has never won the Melbourne Cup. He wants to so badly that he has five runners in this year\u2019s race, all which will trot out in the famous royal blue of Godolphin. That elusive win may not be far away. Hartnell has one of Australia\u2019s best jockeys in James McDonald, came second to super-horse Winx in the recent WS Cox Plate (a race turf experts say is a better marker to the Melbourne Cup than the likes of other \u201cstaying\u201d races like the Caulfield Cup), and has won at the distance at Ascot in England where staying races are valued more than here. The Cup\u2019s second-favourite is Oceanographer who won the Lexus Stakes (over 2,500m) and placed third in the recent Geelong Cup (3,200m) which was won by Qewy, who is also owned, of course, by the Sheikh.  His other chances include Beautiful Romance (70-1) and Secret Number (33-1), both of whom have been fed the finest oats and pampered like horse-princelings, and could yet make this the Sheikh\u2019s year.   Related: Latest edition of Melbourne Cup set to build on last year\u2019s publicity coup | Michael Hutak    4. Nobody really knows who will win Every tip from every \u201cexpert\u201d in the land counts for nothing, and Prince of Penzance can win at 100-1 like he did last year with a form line and breeding that would put it in the category of \u201cswamp donkey\u201d against the elite blue-blooded horses bred by Godolphin.  But that doesn\u2019t usually happen. In fact 100-1 shots would win races far less than one in a hundred times. So if you\u2019re studying form and trying to pick a winner from your newspaper\u2019s form guide, try to fossick about and find horses that have been successful over the distance (3,200 metres) or thereabouts. Indeed any success from 2,000m to 3,200m and above is staying form.  Oceanographer is one that fits the bill. A last-start winner, super impressive in both the Geelong Cup and in winning the Lexus, he\u2019s low weight, which is a real bonus for Europeans, and the forecast of rain may also suit him. He should, however, be wary of Almandin, because in-form jockey Kerrin McEvoy hopped off Oceanographer to ride him. Clearly the best local chance is Hartnell. He has been set for the Melbourne Cup and the Cox Plate was just a warmup. Winx beat him soundly but that was Winx\u2019s grand final while Hartnell is set for a longer trip. He still beat a bunch of quality horses in the Cox Plate by some distance. He represents a bit of a risk at the 3,200m based on last year\u2019s performance (in the same race) but he\u2019s in much better form now than last year \u2013 and doesn\u2019t have to race Winx again. 5. Gambling is a mug\u2019s game Australians will bet an estimated $800m on this year\u2019s Melbourne Cup, which represents 3.5% of the $23bn Australians spend on gambling per annum. Yes, $23bn, which works out at about $1,000 per man, woman and child. It seems quite a lot. And one might think that one day there may come a reckoning for the country\u2019s greater social good given the flow of revenue from poor people (gamblers) to rich people (bookmakers), just as there is on a micro level for hundreds of thousands of families that lose houses, cars, each other, because of addiction to the punt. And therein lies a cautionary tale: if you \u201cwin\u201d today you will feel euphoria. You will feel like Homer Simpson in his dream about life after robbing the Quik-E-Mart, with Marge in a bikini doing a go-go dance and Homer sucking on a cigar in a rocking chair on the steps of a giant white house. But there is one certainty about a life \u201con the punt\u201d and it is this: you will lose. Money will flow from your wallet or virtual account into whatever electronic contraption is owned by the corporate bookmaker, a super-smart computing machine running algorithms with one sole purpose in life: to fleece you of your money.

The law will also oblige coffee shops to offer reading material for their customers, said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the UAE\u2019s vice-president and Dubai\u2019s ruler, and will see branches of libraries opened in malls, as well as exempting books from fees and taxes. The government-owned daily the National reported Sheikh Mohammed saying: \u201cOur objective is to make reading a daily habit in our people, where relevant entities will be required to translate this law into reality,\u201d and calling the law an \u201cunprecedented cultural and legislative initiative\u201d that \u201cconsolidates the cultural image of books in the society\u201d. \u201cThe law takes a key value like reading and turns it in[to] an integrated government project,\u201d he added. The law will also see a \u201cknowledge briefcase\u201d, or reading bag, given to children. The bags will be provided at birth, one and two years, will be in Arabic for UAE nationals and Arab expatriates and in English for non-Arab expatriates. Expatriates are estimated to make up 90% of the population. And it will mean that unwanted books cannot be destroyed, but must be \u201cpreserved, reused or donated\u201d. \u201cThe law will encourage the private sector to invest in the establishment of libraries and cultural centres. This will be done by providing the private sector with facilities, incentives and discounts,\u201d said Sheikh Mohammed, according to the National. \u201cOur goal is for 2016 to be the start of a sustainable cultural change among generations \u2013 a change that consolidates the importance of reading, celebrates knowledge and boosts the status of reading.\u201d Last week also marked the conclusion of the Arab Reading Challenge, which Sheikh Mohammed launched last September. It saw more than 150m books read by around 3.5m children from more than 20 countries, with participants competing for $3m-worth of prizes. Seven-year-old Mohammed Farah from Algeria won the top prize for students, taking home $150,000 (\u00a3122,000) in educational grants and cash, while the winning school in Nablus, Palestine, was given $1m. The challenge\u2019s success prompted the novelist Paulo Coelho to write to Sheikh Mohammed, telling him that \u201cby riding the vessels of knowledge, powered by the wind of reading, you will soon anchor on the shore of a very bright and prosperous future\u201d. Sheikh Mohammed replied that \u201cthere is no future without books\u201d. \u201cWe have experienced a time when the people of our region focused on books. At that time, we were pioneers, leaders, open to all cultures. We became a beacon for humanity, and paved the way for the European Renaissance. Did you know, Paulo, that in the 9th century, our region had over 100 publishing houses on the outskirts of Baghdad alone? ... When its life was centred on books, Baghdad was, my friend, a beacon in the worlds of astronomy, medicine, mathematics and philosophy. Where is Baghdad today?\u201d he wrote to Coelho. \u201cI do not want to dwell too long on mentioning the profusion of other libraries \u2026 in Alexandria, Cairo, Andalusia, and Morocco. But what I do want to say is that we have learned a clear lesson: there is no future without books; no enlightenment or tolerance or co-existence, without books; no creativity or innovation or invention without books; no economic prosperity or pioneering or leadership.\u201d", "title": "UAE launches new law to 'make reading a daily habit'", "sentences": ["The law will also oblige coffee shops to offer reading material for their customers, said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the UAE\u2019s vice-president and Dubai\u2019s ruler, and will see branches of libraries opened in malls, as well as exempting books from fees and taxes."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-02T12:22:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/02/danny-willett-turkish-airlines-open-race-to-dubai-henrik-stenson-golf", "tags": ["Golf", "Danny Willett", "Henrik Stenson", "Sport"], "article": "Danny Willett\u2019s 2016 will forever be defined by the donning of the Green Jacket. There remains scope for the Yorkshireman to end the year with the European Order of Merit prize which so narrowly eluded him 12 months ago, though by Willett\u2019s own admission the scaling of heights even close to what transpired at Augusta National in April is proving tricky.   Related: Jordan Spieth \u2018slump\u2019 says as much about rivals\u2019 strength as his own woes | Ewan Murray    A third at the BMW PGA Championship and his runners-up finish at the Italian Open stand out as Willett\u2019s only strong results since The Masters. Last week at the WGC-HSBC Champions, he closed at an aggregate of 14-over par. His Ryder Cup, in his own words and partly linked to the unhelpful antics of his brother, was \u201cshit\u201d. Somehow, Willett is seeking to summon the spirit of Augusta. The Turkish Airlines Open, starting on Thursday, is the second of four tournaments in succession for Willett to conclude the season. For now he lies second in the Race to Dubai behind Henrik Stenson, who is not in this week\u2019s field. \u201cThe last couple of months have been poor, to be honest, in a lot of aspects,\u201d Willett admitted on Wednesday. \u201cLast year I missed out in the Race to Dubai to Rory. He played great in Dubai, the final one. I think I had to just beat him and it would have been mine but he finished first and I finished fourth. \u201cThis year I\u2019d been leading it for a long, long time. Unfortunately last week I had probably my worst event on tour for all the years I\u2019ve been on, and Henrik finished second, so jumped me. For me, this is a pretty big week. Henrik is not here \u2013 he was never scheduled to play anyway. So it gives me a chance to either close that gap, or hopefully leapfrog again and make it really interesting coming down to the last two [events]. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can. The game is average; it has been average for a couple of months, so we\u2019re working hard and we\u2019re trying to do the right things. Unfortunately you have highs and lows in golf and the last couple of months have been a bit of a low. Before that was a massive high. You just keep working hard, and if you do that, then it\u2019s only around the corner.\u201d If the fresh levels of attention and time constraints that came with being a major champion were the most problematic aspects for Willett, that would be perfectly understandable. Yet that does not actually seem to be the case. Rather, the 29-year-old\u2019s desire to further his game after winning that first major is the key factor. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get better and better,\u201d Willett said. \u201cFor me, April has been a pretty magical month but you still try and push your game forward and push your game on. At times that leads to taking a few steps backwards in trying to change things that you\u2019re doing and unfortunately it\u2019s just been a bit of a stale run. It\u2019s happened at a really bad time of year. \u201cThe focus isn\u2019t on the short-term goal \u2013 it\u2019s a long-term goal, and you\u2019ve got to start making changes eventually and doing something different if you want to get better. Everyone\u2019s getting better every week. Just because I won in April doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s going to continue for ever. You\u2019ve got to make sure you keep on top of things and that you keep trying to get better. Just at the minute it\u2019s just a little bit stale. \u201cWe\u2019re working incredibly hard in the gym, off the golf course, doing everything right and practising hard. It\u2019s just not quite going the way that I would have envisioned it going these last couple of months. I\u2019m pretty sure that I work with two of the best coaches in the world in Mike Walker and Pete Cowen. I\u2019ve got a very good team around me and we\u2019re trying to do everything correct and I\u2019m pretty sure that everything we\u2019re doing is correct.\u201d Willett was joined for pre-tournament duties here by Lee Westwood, who became the latest player to shrug off security concerns relating to an event in Turkey. Several have opted to skip this tournament with such fears in mind. Westwood answered \u201cyes, a little bit\u201d when asked whether he had been disappointed by withdrawal levels. \u201cI think the world we live in right now, anything can happen anywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cI think Turkey is no different to anywhere else. \u201cI think everybody has to be very vigilant about these things but I certainly have no security worries about coming to Turkey. You [the media] are here, so you obviously aren\u2019t going to do it if you have fears and I\u2019m no different to you. I value my life as much as you value yours.

When the ministry wanted to provide clean water to villagers, it was sometimes only possible if private companies belonging to local power brokers \u2013 usually MPs, district administrators or police chiefs \u2013 were given the construction contracts. If they didn\u2019t win the bid, they would take their share through extortion. Sometimes, the ministry\u2019s facilitating partners lost their machinery, or found them on fire while working on our road projects because they hadn\u2019t paid a bribe to the armed groups that controlled the project area.  My ministry, the ministry of rural development, was the most important arm of government. We were involved in nearly 35,000 of the roughly 40,000 villages across the country. In the process, we provided around 70% of Afghans with vital infrastructure, such as midwife clinics, schools, waterworks, bridges, roads, women\u2019s training centres, or solar power projects. This was genuinely important work for genuinely needy people \u2013 and yet it was often disrupted by the corruption of the political class, who would, one way or another, find a way of getting their hands on the money.      A Kyrgyz man installs solar panels that charge car batteries to provide electricity, mainly for light bulbs and radios, Wakhan, Afghanistan. Photograph: Matthieu Paley/Getty Images/National Geographic Magazines    And where was the money was coming from? It came from the pockets of the taxpayers in EU, UK, US, Canada, and Australia. I have since left Afghanistan, but I was recently reminded of my former life when European leaders gathered in Brussels to give $3bn (\u00a32.45bn) to Afghanistan. The UK alone announced \u00a3750m in aid for the coming three years. As a former government official, and a former UN staffer in Afghanistan, I have concerns about how this money will be spent. What safeguards are in place to ensure that the money benefits Afghans? Will a farmer in a remote village benefit from these donations after they seep through various corrupted layers of government? Will it help a deported asylum seeker to build a new life? I worry that Europe has given the Afghan government a blank cheque. The current political elite in Afghanistan took power 15 years ago after international coalition forces toppled the Taliban regime. Since then, the world has poured hundreds of billions of dollars to Afghanistan. Most of what was pledged was meant to bring peace, stability, build and rebuild institutions that would work for all Afghans after so many years of wars and devastation. Instead, much of that money has been wasted. You could even argue that the dangers posed by Isis and the Taliban, who now control more land than at any point since the 2001 western intervention, are ultimately less damaging than the country\u2019s corruption. Afghanistan was ranked 166 out of 168 countries on Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception 2015 index. Government has often become a self-serving means of enriching the political class. Several politicians have built up business empires that overshadow any attempts to bring about positive change to people\u2019s lives. The political elites have ethnocentric agendas, exacerbate tribal rivalries and political intolerance, erode political will, and increase impunity for the powerful. The donor community has allowed this dynamic to emerge. Donors do highlight Afghanistan\u2019s corruption epidemic. But they never link their aid to any kind of genuinely effective scrutiny, and as result they have ultimately failed to hold the Afghan government to account for how they spend the donors\u2019 money. The Kabul Bank scandal was an obvious example. It saw $850m (\u00a3700m) lost to fraud at Afghanistan\u2019s biggest bank, and was described by US officials as \u201cthe biggest per capita fraud in history\u201d. The bank\u2019s shareholders were mostly from the country\u2019s political elite, and included cabinet ministers, MPs, and warlords. The bank\u2019s executives spent $160m (\u00a3130m) alone on 35 luxury villas in Dubai, many of which were registered in the names of shareholders. But those to blame for this massive money laundering have ultimately proved untouchable. Khalilullah Ferozi, the former executive of the bank, was sentenced to five years in prison. But last year he was released in order to sign a multimillion property deal with the Afghan government.      An Afghan man prepares tea for refugees displaced fighting between Afghan forces and Taliban insurgents. Since corruption goes unpunished Afghans feel betrayed by their leaders, and insurgents have fed off this disappointment. Photograph: Shah Marai/AFP/Getty Images    This kind of corruption indirectly exacerbates Afghanistan\u2019s conflict. Since corruption consistently goes unpunished, Afghans feel betrayed by their leaders \u2013 and insurgents have in turn fed off this widespread sense of disappointment. The enemy sees a vacuum to fill. Just last week, Taliban insurgents attacked Kunduz \u2013 the last stronghold lost by the Taliban in 2001. This is the second time in two months that the Taliban have attacked Kunduz \u2013 they first briefly seized it last August. Despite all this, Europe\u2019s aid is only conditional on Afghanistan agreeing to re-admit all refugees deported from Europe. This is a condition that will do nothing to stop corruption, and do everything to endanger ordinary Afghans, who will be sent back to a war zone. According to the recent United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan report on Afghanistan, 5,166 civilians were killed during just the first six months of this year. And between 2009 and June 2016, civilian casualties reached 63,934. Another report shows that half of Afghanistan\u2019s territory experiences war and violence on a daily basis. So shouldn\u2019t Europe\u2019s aid be conditional on something other than deportations? The money will definitely be wasted unless donor countries encourage the Afghan government to implement a real anti-corruption strategy that is supported by law. It must be conditional on fighting corruption \u2013 and the Afghan government should also show the political will to end impunity for corrupt officials. In order to create an effective and transparent government in Kabul, the donors who pledge their taxpayers\u2019 money should draw specific red lines for spending this pledged money. Otherwise, these cheques will be as blank as they have been in the past.", "title": "Afghanistan's corruption epidemic is wasting billions in aid", "sentences": ["The bank\u2019s executives spent $160m (\u00a3130m) alone on 35 luxury villas in Dubai, many of which were registered in the names of shareholders."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-03T08:00:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/03/refugee-fashion-startup-palestinian-jordan-sep", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Social enterprises", "Society", "Jordan", "Refugees", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Middle East and North Africa", "Poverty", "Social exclusion", "Employment", "Global development"], "article": "Born in a Jordanian refugee camp to Palestinian parents, Asma Aradeh is stateless. The 36-year-old mother of six is one of more than 30,000 Palestinian exiles living for decades in legal limbo in Jordan\u2019s Jerash camp. But there is one silver lining to Aradeh\u2019s story: she is no longer jobless. Three years ago, Aradeh became one of 40 women to join a fledgling social enterprise called SEP Jordan, which manufactures contemporary design products based on traditional Palestinian embroidery. She is now quality controller of the socially minded startup, which has trained around 500 women across the camp.  \u201cI was born and raised here all my life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe tried very hard to find work [but] we couldn\u2019t go outside the camp for work. SEP came to us; it gave us work close to where we live and even in our own houses.\u201d The company, brainchild of Italian-born Roberta Ventura, a former banker based in Geneva, endeavours to break the \u201caid trap\u201d in which many refugees find themselves by providing productive, dignified work for women in the camp.      Roberta Ventura. Photograph: Manal Sehaimat/CIIN    Most women who join SEP have advanced embroidery skills, but all still go through a basic one or two month training programme to ensure they are are up to speed with the company\u2019s designs and quality requirements. There are no firm working times, although SEP doesn\u2019t allow women to work more than four hours a day, to protect their eyesight. Embroidery is labour-intensive. A tablecloth takes eight months to complete on average. At the women\u2019s request, payment is calculated by the amount of thread used rather than hours worked. Ventura insists the approach ensures a dignified wage, although incomes vary according to how much work each woman chooses to do. \u201cThe monthly income for the artists can vary from as little as 5 Jordanian dinar (\u00a35.77) to as much as 400 Jordanian dinar (\u00a3461), which compares to a minimum wage of 190 dinar in Jordan\u2019s garment sector,\u201d she says. SEP is operating in an environment where employment opportunities are highly restricted. Refugees in Jordan are not permitted to work as teachers, civil servants or any other state-supported job, with the tourism business closed to them as well. So, too, is free schooling after grade 9 (aged 16), which denies most the chance to get their high school diploma \u2013 a ticket into the formal labour market. Running a viable business in a refugee camp is no easy task, Ventura concedes. For many women in the camp, simply persuading their husbands to allow them to work can represent a cultural challenge. Technological literacy is also low, so SEP\u2019s inventory and production processes remain largely un-computerised.  An even bigger headache is red tape. All the fabric needed has to be imported but customs clearance procedures are \u201cbeyond nightmarish\u201d, says Venture. On top of that, courier companies frequently refuse to transport goods to and from the camp, deeming it too dangerous for their drivers.   Three years in and SEP\u2019s field team of five full-time staff plus a small management team in Geneva (which includes Ventura and her husband) have more or less navigated through the production challenges. Now Ventura\u2019s focus is shifting to boosting sales.     All the fabric needed has to be imported.

Annual sales revenues are currently around US$120,000 (\u00a398,000). Sara Carter, co-founder of Clerkenwell, a design store in London and one of SEP\u2019s stockists, says part of the brand\u2019s appeal is the \u201clittle design twists\u201d. The personal stories behind the products are another winning factor, she adds, with each carrying the name of the embroiderer. \u201cWhen you think how long these products have taken to make and the story behind them, it becomes a lot more real to people,\u201d says Carter.    Related: Hidden child labour: how Syrian refugees in Turkey are supplying Europe with fast fashion    SEP\u2019s products aren\u2019t cheap, with baby blankets and linen towels retailing at \u00a399 and \u00a3178 respectively. It is pitched at the luxury market, given the time embroidered goods take to make and the high costs of production. \u201cWe are quite expensive because the women \u2013 rightly so \u2013 want to be paid well [\u2026] What\u2019s important to us is that we\u2019re building loyalty to the company by putting the ladies who work for us at the centre of what we do rather than being in the shadows,\u201d says Ventura. To date, SEP has been financed through private investment. Assuming it meets its projected sales figures, Ventura believes the company will be ready for equity investment from social impact funds in a couple of years. In the interim, the business\u2019s growth plans are reliant on grant funding and in-kind support.  One of SEP\u2019s early backers has been Beirut-born businesswoman and human rights activist Mary Nazzal-Batayneh, who gives the pro-refugee social enterprise free retail space in a five-star hotel she owns in Amman.  \u201cFor me as a Palestinian activist, this is a really important method to tell the story of the longest-standing refugee population in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd since the refugee crisis is only getting worse and worse, it\u2019s great to have a model where these people can make some kind of living.\u201d Batayneh is helping introduce SEP to potential investors. Creating opportunities for refugees to earn income reinforces self-worth, allows more independence and also reduces the economic burdens on the host nation, says Salil Tripathi, senior adviser on global issues, Institute for Human Rights and Business. \u201cHowever, care must be taken that labour rights are respected, and if jobs come at the cost of local residents, there must be adequate safeguards, such as skills training and alternative job opportunities to minimise the risk of conflict between refugees and local residents.\u201d", "title": "Asma has been a refugee for 36 years; now a fashion startup has offered a lifeline", "sentences": ["Photograph: Manal Sehaimat/CIIN    At present, its embroidered products \u2013 which range from clutches and linen shawls to Kuffyieh scarfs and tablecloths \u2013 can be found in boutiques in Paris, London, Geneva, Beirut, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Amman."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-03T11:39:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/04/dubai-design-district-norman-foster-zaha-hadid-design-week", "tags": ["Design", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"], "article": "On the edge of the sprawling emirate of Dubai, in an area that was until recently a large patch of sand, gaggles of well-dressed twentysomethings roll around in spinning chairs designed by Thomas Heatherwick, while others queue at a coffee cart, admiring the shiny lampshades in the window of a pop-up Tom Dixon showroom.

Related: Ryan Moore a step ahead on Highland Reel in Ascot\u2019s King George    And on the face of it Found looks as bankable as they come. She is the top-rated performer in the field, beat the Derby winner Golden Horn to land the same contest 12 months ago, and her overall profile is that of a horse who delivers her best form, at the highest level, over and over again. \u201cTough and highly durable\u201d is Timeform\u2019s assessment of Found, which is, if anything, doing her a disservice. Her last seven starts have all been at Group One level and Found has finished first or second in all seven. She is far from an odds-on chance in the betting, however, and there are some good reasons why. Flintshire, who started his career with Andr\u00e9 Fabre but is now the best middle-distance turf horse in the States, should be a very tough opponent even if he does need to bounce back from a disappointing run \u2013 on good-to-soft ground - last time out. Found\u2019s stable companion Highland Reel, the King George winner, was also less than two lengths behind her in the Arc, while it is also hard to overlook the fact that, for all her consistency, only one of those seven Group One runs this year actually resulted in a victory. Perhaps the most significant concern, though, is the likely speed of the turf track here on Saturday. The turf was relaid in the summer and, while it is always quick in California, there is a consensus that this year, it could be faster than ever. Found does have some form on fast ground and it was good-to-firm when she took the Arc but turf as firm as it is likely to be this weekend is an unknown. The good news from O\u2019Brien\u2019s point of view, however, is that Highland Reel (10.22pm) is both high-class and versatile and perhaps a horse, too, whose form has not received quite the credit it deserves. He took two Group Ones outside Europe as a three-year-old, winning both at Arlington Park in Chicago and Sha Tin in Hong Kong, and the ground was very quick for his run at Arlington in particular. A well-run 12 furlongs on firm ground could be just what he needs, Seamie Heffernan has proved time and again that he is an excellent No2 jockey and Highland Reel makes plenty of appeal at around 7-2 (and quite possibly a bigger price on the US Tote). O\u2019Brien was noticeably keen this week to stress how much he is looking forward to seeing Washington DC (9.05pm) in the Turf Sprint and the red-hot pace should set the race up for Ryan Moore to deliver a late challenge. His Falmouth Stakes winner Alice Springs, however, may struggle to cope with Limato (11.40pm) in the Mile, as Henry Candy\u2019s gelding seems tailor-made for the challenge. Sir Michael Stoute seemed a little cool on the chance of Ulysses in the Turf earlier this week but perked up considerably when discussing Queen\u2019s Trust (7.43pm) in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf and she could be another British-trained winner if she can get a little more luck than in several of her recent starts. For American fans, meanwhile, the highlight of the week will be California Chrome\u2019s attempt to add the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic to a career record which already includes the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and the Dubai World Cup in seven Grade One wins. Arrogate, a wide-margin winner in a track record time last time out, is a new challenge for Art Sherman\u2019s outstanding five-year-old but California Chrome (12.35am) has continued to improve as he has matured and he should deliver the victory that many in the huge Santa Anita crowd will be desperate to see. Haveyougoneaway (11.01pm) has a live chance in the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint for Tom Morley, whose late uncle David was a multiple Group One winner in Britain. Union Strike (7.05pm) and Drefong (8.21pm) are the picks at the prices in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 and Sprint respectively, while the front-running Syndergaard (9.43pm) may just have enough to win a very tight renewal of the Juvenile.

The European Tour\u2019s chef executive Keith Pelley, meanwhile, has refused to rule out radical changes to Ryder Cup eligibility criteria. Under present regulations, only full-time European Tour members are eligible to represent the continent; a scenario that caused the high-profile absence of Paul Casey from this year\u2019s meeting with the USA at Hazeltine.

We will have them with our players.

The seven-shot lead as held by the Dane before the final round of the Turkish Airlines Open had been whittled down to one by the marauding David Horsey. One of the great golfing capitulations of our time was very much on the cards. The mettle of champions is tested in such situations. Olesen duly made an impressive up-and-down from the greenside bunker at the 12th, thereby restoring his advantage to two. The outcome of this event was never truly in doubt from there, Olesen claiming the biggest win of his career by three from Horsey and Li Haotong. A fourth round of 69, two under par, meant Olesen took the trophy at minus 20.   Related: Aussie amateurs look to challenge Spieth and Scott at Australian Open    \u201cThis means a lot,\u201d Olesen said. \u201cIt has been a bad spell for me, the last three or four months. I played well at the start of the season and felt like I had a good chance to actually make the Ryder Cup team. In the summer there, I just got into a bad spell and played badly in the big events. \u201cComing back here and then winning such a big tournament is huge. I feel like my game is good enough to compete in all the biggest tournaments.\u201d Olesen has now won European Tour events in four of the past five seasons. The 26-year-old\u2019s latest victory earns him \u00a3950,000 but more intriguing will be what happens next. Olesen was known as a rising star of European golf when finishing sixth in the Masters of 2013, his debut at Augusta National, amid which he earned praise from Tiger Woods. Olesen\u2019s failure to properly build on that can be explained in part by injury but he was always highly thought of, as demonstrated by the European Ryder Cup team taking him to Hazeltine in September for a close-up watching brief. The fact that Olesen\u2019s compatriot Thomas Bjorn is odds-on to captain Europe in Paris next time around only adds to already obvious incentive levels. \u201cIt was difficult to be there when you know you\u2019ve been really close to actually making the team but I tried to learn as much as possible and take it as an experience,\u201d Olesen explained. \u201cIt gave me a lot of motivation, definitely, to make it in two years\u2019 time but also it gave me motivation to just go home and work harder and try to win more tournaments and try to play better golf. \u201cIt\u2019s so special, the Ryder Cup. It\u2019s a totally different event and the atmosphere there is unique. As a golfer, that\u2019s where you want to be and it\u2019s so different from TV. It was great for me to actually be there and see it, to stand on the first tee and get that experience and I think if I\u2019m there in two years\u2019 time, I\u2019ll be more prepared.\u201d Horsey was not too downbeat. A cheque for \u00a3496,000 after a fine closing round of 65 probably helped his attitude. \u201cI take a lot of confidence because that\u2019s probably as relaxed as I\u2019ve ever felt playing in contention,\u201d said the 31-year-old from Stockport. \u201cIf I can just tidy up in a few areas, there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t continue contending in the near future.\u201d Bernd Wiesberger took fourth on his own at 15 under, a shot clear of the first- round leader, George Coetzee. Tyrrell Hatton\u2019s excellent 2016 continued with a share of\u00a010th. Danny Willett\u2019s dejection at failing to make a proper dent in Henrik Stenson\u2019s European order of merit lead was apparent as he stepped from the course after posting a 75. Willett\u2019s share of 68th earned him less than \u20ac10,000, leaving Stenson firmly in the driving seat going into the season-ending events in Sun City and Dubai. Willett even contemplated not appearing in South Africa. \u201cI\u2019m not having much fun playing golf at the moment,\u201d said the Masters champion. After a brief spell of calm reflection, it seemed Willett will indeed tee up on Thursday. One feels, nonetheless, that the end of a year that delivered such epic glory to Willett cannot now come quickly enough.

Dettori, predictably, performed a flying dismount afterwards. Heffernan, just as predictably, did not. Heffernan will never be a household name like Dettori or move markets like Ryan Moore but his career record now includes 26 victories at Group One or Grade One level. In what is, by definition, a highly competitive business he has found a niche as a perennial No2 at Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s stable and, when it comes to making the best of one\u2019s opportunities, there is no one in the sport to match him. Moore, O\u2019Brien\u2019s principal jockey, was scarcely sighted on either day at Santa Anita. Found, the Arc winner, was the only one of his six rides to make the frame and she simply stayed on into third place in the Turf without ever threatening the winner. But then none of Highland Reel\u2019s opponents managed to threaten his lead either, as Heffernan seized his latest opportunity with a rare flourish. He was in control of the race from the opening strides and in effect secured victory almost half a mile out as he opened a lead that Highland Reel, a multiple winner at the highest level, was never going to surrender. Plenty of the spectators in the 70,000-strong crowd pointed fingers at Heffernan\u2019s opponents, with Javier Castellano a particular target for his ride on Flintshire, the second-favourite. Yet Heffernan executed his own plan so adroitly that there was very little the rest of them could do about it. Moore, of course, will be back aboard Highland Reel if he now runs in either Japan or Hong Kong at the tail-end of the season, but Heffernan is fine with that. \u201cI\u2019ve been there a long time and I went there as a second jockey and work rider,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cI get very, very well looked after. More recently my name is coming out of the hat for the rides and I\u2019m happy with my position. There\u2019s no pressure. I\u2019m never really on the first string, though the first and third string can be equal, never mind the second string.\u201d O\u2019Brien himself always bends over backwards to stress that Ballydoyle\u2019s success is a team effort. Heffernan has now been part of that team for two decades \u2013 his first Group winner for O\u2019Brien was in August 1996 \u2013 and his Santa Anita victory was one of the most memorable moments of what was, even by the standards of the Breeders\u2019 Cup, an exceptional weekend. Dettori\u2019s win on Queen\u2019s Trust was another. The horsemanship, timing and confidence that have made him one of the all-time greats were all in evidence as he squeezed Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s filly past Lady Eli, the favourite, in the final stride, and then waggled his whip to celebrate victory a moment later. Dettori was seemingly the only person at Santa Anita who was absolutely confident that Queen\u2019s Trust had got up and, as so often, he was spot on. The memories that will live longest for the American fans, however, will be the contests which closed the cards on Friday and Saturday night. After one of the great stretch duels between Beholder and the previously unbeaten Songbird in Friday\u2019s Distaff, it seemed greedy to hope for something to match it in the Classic on Saturday night but the race between Arrogate and California Chrome which closed the meeting was every bit as good. As California Chrome, the darling of the Santa Anita crowd, led the field into the stretch, Arrogate, who made his racecourse debut only a few days after California Chrome\u2019s win in the Dubai World Cup in March, seemed to be struggling to close the gap. Yet Mike Smith, his jockey, kept asking for more and Arrogate kept finding it. With just under a furlong to run, there was a visible moment when the balance of power shifted towards Arrogate, like a shuddering punch in a boxing ring, and he landed his blow so late that the old champion had no time to respond. Arrogate, with only five starts on his record before Saturday, is the most lightly raced Classic winner in Breeders\u2019 Cup history and the best news of all is that he will stay in training next season, when the Classic at Del Mar, a few hundred miles down the coast near San Diego, will presumably be his big target. Before that it is possible that Arrogate will find a berth in the Pegasus Cup, a new event to be staged at Gulfstream Park in January and also the race that is likely to be the last of California Chrome\u2019s career. The Pegasus Cup\u2019s $12m purse, which will make it the world\u2019s richest race, is funded by selling a dozen places in the line-up to leading owners at $1m apiece and, while Prince Khalid Abdullah\u2019s Juddmonte Farms operation did not buy a berth originally, there seems little doubt that it will be able to acquire one if necessary. The Pegasus Cup\u2019s unusual format and sudden appearance in the racing programme has not met with universal approval in the States. First impressions are often the most important, however, and a rematch between Arrogate and California Chrome would be a very good way to announce its arrival.", "title": "Ballydoyle\u2019s quiet man Seamie Heffernan makes Breeders\u2019 Cup quantum leap", "sentences": ["As California Chrome, the darling of the Santa Anita crowd, led the field into the stretch, Arrogate, who made his racecourse debut only a few days after California Chrome\u2019s win in the Dubai World Cup in March, seemed to be struggling to close the gap."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-06T17:44:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/09/european-tour-2017-golf-patrick-reed", "tags": ["European Tour", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Sympathy for Keith Pelley was in short supply last week. No sooner had the European Tour\u2019s chief executive praised strong communication with players with regards to safety at the Turkish Airlines Open than one of the group contradicted him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one who believed it was about to be struck off the schedule due to the security concerns there,\u201d said Shane Lowry, in his routinely excellent column for the Irish Times. \u201cI know everyone\u2019s going to say how good it was in Turkey and how nice the place is but there were times last week we simply didn\u2019t know what was going to happen and that is a situation that doesn\u2019t suit me at all. \u201cI think the information we were getting, or probably more importantly weren\u2019t getting, wasn\u2019t good enough.

This struck a chord with members of the media who were accredited for the event. There was no message, detailed or otherwise, in the buildup with regards to precisely why Turkey was safe and the tournament could be attended without fear. Instead, there was disappointing silence. The key thing is the competition passed without notable incident, aside from a highly encouraging Thorbjorn Olesen win. If raw talent alone counts, the Dane will be part of the Ryder Cup in 2018. By that time, the European Tour scene will look different. Next week in Dubai, Pelley will announce the schedule for next season, with a high number of changes expected. Among them, perhaps, will be the removal of a Final Series, which has thrown up more problems than answers despite the riches on offer. The Irish Open will immediately precede its Scottish equivalent, with Turkey potentially switched to another calendar slot entirely. The simple element of Pelley\u2019s job is also the most complex \u2013 coaxing the sponsors he so desires to drive up tournament purses to the point where the PGA Tour is even partly challenged. The situation in Europe will become even more acute, and difficult, if the PGA Tour ups its playing demands for full-time membership. Blue chip companies will only invest with the knowledge top players will contest their events; those professionals have their own agendas, schedules and commitments to the point where guaranteed fields and purses is a seriously tricky business. In this game of cat and mouse, Pelley\u2019s reputation is on the line, not least because he took office with grand promises of increasing the attractiveness of the European Tour. It is with this spinning of plates in mind that Pelley\u2019s potentially special treatment of Patrick Reed should be viewed. Also speaking in Turkey, the chief executive all but admitted Reed will be permitted to rejoin the European Tour for the new season despite falling short of the requisite number of 2016 playing appearances. Reed\u2019s scenario does not look entirely clever when the Ryder Cup and Olympic Games contributed to a total of three. One rule for one? You bet it is. By the same principle, albeit not in exactly the same circumstances, Rory McIlroy was permitted to turn out in the Race to Dubai finale 12 months ago. Here is the rub; without marquee players, the European Tour product is vastly diminished. That, in turn, inevitably affects commercial opportunity and what monies are on offer at the lower end of the scale. In Turkey, even those sharing 31st place collected \u20ac45,000 each. Top golfers are the European Tour\u2019s selling point and, being blunt, their best negotiating tool. It would seem unfair to castigate Pelley on one hand for not delivering on his early plans before making the same criticism for trying to attract the biggest names. From Reed\u2019s point of view, the willingness to be a European Tour member in itself highlights an endearing desire to be a global golfer rather than exist permanently within the confines of his home competitions. The essential element here is in Reed committing to specific events in Europe, rather than paying lip service to the Tour and, therefore, undermining Pelley\u2019s exemption. This is a golfer who starred in the Ryder Cup, who has the game components to be a multiple major champion and among the top bracket in the world. There is no logic attached to his playing in events from Abu Dhabi to Ayrshire not being appealing. Reed, unlike far too many within his sport, has character to dovetail with talent. In Dubai, Pelley will inevitably continue with his bullish stance towards the future. It may be he has tried to immediately alter too much within his company than was feasible from the outset.

But with the high-value notes withdrawn from Wednesday in an effort to combat corruption, black-market trade and tax evasion, many were left without cash for day-to-day expenses. Banks were closed on Wednesday, and reopened on Thursday morning with a cap on cash withdrawals. ATMs remained closed, so currency was only available from the banks. Newspapers around the country reported long queues at branches, as people scrambled to exchange their high-value banknotes for 100-rupee bills.

I got here at 8.01,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s noon, but I\u2019m still here. Around 50 people in the queue ahead of me got tired of waiting and left but I have no choice. There\u2019s no money in the house. We only have 500- and 1,000-rupee notes which are worth nothing. We didn\u2019t even have enough to pay the milkman this morning.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t even buy a cup of tea,\u201d said Guru Birajdar, a lawyer. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to work today because I had no cash. All my money is in 500s and 1,000s so I had to come straight to the bank this morning. I had two 100-rupee notes in my wallet on Tuesday night, but I used that up yesterday.\u201d  Shops, train stations, and taxis stopped accepting 500- and 1,000-rupee notes on Wednesday, interrupting normal trade. Even hospitals, which are exempt from the immediate demonetisation, have reportedly turned down payments in high-value banknotes. Some complained that Modi\u2019s surprise announcement had completely disrupted normal life. \u201cNobody is willing to give you change,\u201d said Solanki. \u201cThey should have planned this properly instead of springing it upon us.\u201d     A security guard hands out request slips for the exchange of bank notes at a branch of the State Bank of India in Old Delhi. Photograph: Cathal Mcnaughton/Reuters    In rural areas especially, where around two-thirds of India\u2019s 1.25 billion population live and access to banks is difficult, Modi\u2019s announcement caused chaos. Reshma Murthy, who works as a maid in the city, said she had come to deposit 4,000 rupees for her family in her village. \u201cThey called me and said they had no cash at all. This was a bad decision. They should have given us more time. It happened too fast,\u201d she said.  Others argued the post-Diwali season, during which people had received cash bonuses, was ideal timing for the announcement. \u201cThe local municipal elections are starting soon, and it will make life very difficult for politicians who take a lot of cash bribes around this time,\u201d Birajdar said. \u201cFor us, it is an inconvenience, but it was a good decision by the government.\u201d Analysts said the surprise move could hurt the Indian economy in the near-term but would ultimately prove positive, by cutting corruption and giving a badly needed boost to stretched government finances.  There are also hopes the clampdown will curb inflation, notably cutting property prices \u2013 an area of the economy where many transactions are in cash. That in turn would give India\u2019s central bank more leeway to cut interest rates. \u201cThis initiative will likely hurt growth in the very short term, but will yield significant benefits in the medium to long term as corruption is cut and the ease of doing business improves, as more of the economy moves into the formal sector,\u201d said Jonathan Schiessl, chief investment officer at Ashburton Investments.  The move also sent positive signals about the government\u2019s determination to clamp down on black money, said Mihir Kapadia, founder of wealth management company Sun Global Investments, which is based in London, Dubai and Mumbai. \u201cCorruption, tax evasion and black money have been major problems for the Indian economy for many decades. Black money is a major factor in propping up property prices and inflating valuations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bold, dramatic, unprecedented move \u2026 It shows Mr Modi\u2019s determination to tackle corruption and vested interests and make very fundamental reforms. This is very positive for the economy and makes us convinced that reforms will be pushed very deeply,\u201d he said. By its nature, India\u2019s shadow economy is hard to quantify. But a 2010 World Bank-sponsored study (pdf) estimated it was equivalent to around a quarter of the country\u2019s GDP.  Citing those figures, analysts at the bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said the notes decision would prove supportive for stock markets in India. \u201cThis demonetisation step reinforces Modi\u2019s reformist and anti-corruption credentials and raises the prospect of higher long term growth potential,\u201d they wrote in a note to clients.", "title": "Your money's no good: rupee note cancellation plunges India into panic", "sentences": ["The move also sent positive signals about the government\u2019s determination to clamp down on black money, said Mihir Kapadia, founder of wealth management company Sun Global Investments, which is based in London, Dubai and Mumbai."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-10T17:06:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/11/rembrandt-somme-the-week-in-art", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "Painting", "Exhibitions", "Photography"], "article": "Exhibition of the week The SommeThe battle whose waste of life has become an image of the futility and madness of war is remembered by 21st-century artists including Jeremy Clark, Helen Grey, Michael Isaac, Lauren Adams and Charlotte Potter.\u2022 Moor House, London, from 11-30 November.

But that wasn\u2019t enough to prevent \u00a32.5m being siphoned out of about 9,000 accounts, and transferred to criminals whose identities and locations remain a mystery. The damage to the bank\u2019s reputation may be significant \u2013 but more significant still is that the attack is only the latest, and presently most visible, example of a rising tide of onslaughts against online banking, which seek to exploit any weak spot in web-facing computer systems and their users. The hackers\u2019 motives are straightforward. As the wild west bank robber Willie Sutton explained when asked to explain his motivation: \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d And experts warn that 2016, which has already seen an audacious attempt to steal \u00a3763m ($951m) electronically from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in the spring, is the precursor for much worse to come. \u201cBecause a lot of economies aren\u2019t in good shape, you\u2019ll see more and more skilled computing people being out of work, and turning to the dark side where they work for criminals,\u201d says Ilia Kolochenko, chief executive of High-Tech Bridge, a web security company. \u201cAnd at the same time you\u2019ve got a lot of companies trying to optimise their costs, and preferring to save money on the cyber side. It\u2019s hard to predict how successful and how large the scale will be, but I\u2019m pretty sure it will get worse.\u201d The Bangladesh attack occurred in February, when hackers broke into the Swift network, the international financial transfer information system, and told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make 32\u00a0transactions totalling $951m to accounts around the world. Although only $101m, in two transactions, was paid out, a total of $63m has not been recovered. Swift has since warned banks to update their software. It is highly unlikely that the same group was behind the Tesco Bank attack; the amounts involved \u2013 and number of accounts \u2013 are so different as to imply separate operations. However, this suggests that various gangs are trying to break into banks and accounts online. There have certainly been a number of online raids \u2013 some involving big money. In 2013, online security company Kaspersky said that as much as $900m had been stolen from 100 banks after their internal systems were infected with malware. And in late 2015, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency investigated the theft of \u00a320m from several accounts, enabled by malware which had infiltrated customers\u2019 PCs. There are suspicions that Tesco Bank\u2019s security model was more vulnerable to compromise than it should have been: once logged in to a current account, a user could set up a transfer to a current account in another bank without having to get an SMS confirmation. The question, still unanswered, is how the accounts were targeted.     Feezan Hameed, jailed for 11 years over thefts of \u00a3113m from British banks. Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA    It is possible that the hackers found a weakness in the back-office systems \u2013 possibly from a current or former employee, suggests Kolochenko. Tesco Bank declined to discuss whether there are any patterns in the accounts that were targeted: \u201cThis is a criminal matter, and so we are constrained in what we can say,\u201d a spokesman said. He declined to say whether any criminals had been identified or what lines of investigation were being pursued. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told MPs last week that \u201cthere are elements of this [attack] that look unprecedented\u201d, but did not elucidate. What parts are unprecedented? The fraud was far from the largest conducted on a UK bank; in September, the23-year-old head of a fraud ring, Feezan Hameed, was jailed for 11 years, after his gang stole \u00a3113m from British banks. They fooled people into thinking they were talking to their bank, and got them to hand over their internet details \u2013 which he would then use to get access to their accounts. Only \u00a347m has been recovered. So if the FCA\u2019s Bailey is worried, it must be about the online nature and the scale of the attack \u2013 not its value. And this is the concern: if criminals can compromise 9,000 accounts in a matter of hours during a weekend and siphon off an average of \u00a3280 from each one before being spotted, what\u2019s to prevent it being done to an even greater number of accounts for greater amounts of money, and leaving banks to pick up the pieces? What\u2019s to stop it being done to any bank every night? The idea of banks building up a false sense of security before a disaster might sound familiar. Simon Moores, an independent consultant on security, likens the situation now to the US financial market in 2006/7, when complacency over the inherent risks of mortgage-based products was compounded by ratings agencies which had an interest in certifying sketchy financial instruments as safe. \u201cIt\u2019s just like The Big Short,\u201d Moores says, referring to the film and book about the lead-up to the financial collapse, which was forecast by only a few. \u201cThe computer security industry is worth \u00a330bn, but it doesn\u2019t work any more. Having a box to protect your bank website or business doesn\u2019t work. But nobody is prepared to accept the fact.\u201d Banks don\u2019t like discussing hacks; more than 100 banks are reckoned to have had up to $900m stolen in late 2013, according to security company Kaspersky. The hackers compromised internal computers and used video feeds for months to learn daily routines. Moores points out that 2015 was a record year for cyber-attacks globally \u2013 but that\u2019s only because 2016 hasn\u2019t finished yet. Malware \u2013 which tries to attack PCs or corporate systems \u2013 is on the rise: \u201cThere are now thought to be more than 500 million worms, Trojans and other viruses in circulation, and reportedly every day there\u2019s another 1.25 million \u2018polymorphic\u2019 threats [which change as they are copied between machines, making identification harder].\u201d     The Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which was told to make 32 transactions totalling $951m for accounts around the world after hackers got into the transfer system. Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA    For banks, the attraction of online banking is clear: it doesn\u2019t require expensive offices in high streets, or the employment of thousands of tellers who might be vulnerable to criminals through blackmail or greed. Instead, it relies on computers, and a relatively small and highly trained (and well-paid) staff, while the customer-support function normally done by tellers can be outsourced to call centres that have little more access than ordinary customers to the banks\u2019 databases. For the customer, online banking should mean greater convenience \u2013 it can be done anywhere and any time you can get an internet connection \u2013 and reliability, since the challenges (such as passwords and memorable words or phrases) you face to log on successfully are more complex than a simple four-digit number at a cash machine. But for both, inserting a computer between the customer and the bank has opened up new risks from malware targeting web browsers, computers and mobile phones. Browsers, software and computers \u2013 both the customers\u2019 and the banks\u2019 \u2013 can have mysterious bugs which allow access to hackers and leave almost no trace; there is a constant need for bug-finding and updates to defeat them. Even while banks strengthen their software, though, the weak link can lie outside. One of the biggest problems for online banking was the malware Zeus, which defeated many antivirus packages. First seen in 2007, it lurked in the background of Windows computers infected via email attachments or web pages and captured logon passwords and account numbers. By 2010, it had infected nearly 4m PCs. In April two men \u2013 a 27-year-old Russian called Aleksandr Andreevich Panin and an Algerian accomplice, Hamza Bendelladj, were given prison sentences totalling more than 24 years for their role in creating and running a \u201cbotnet\u201d of infected computers called SpyEye, which relied on Zeus and had stolen more than $100m from US banks and, by extension, their customers. By 2011, there were versions of Zeus that infected smartphones running on Google\u2019s Android, putting banking apps at risk. So far though, banks appear to have managed to stay ahead in the arms race; the growth in the use of smartphones may actually have helped, because their security model is generally better than PCs, holding apps in deeper \u201csilos\u201d.     Banking app security appears to be better than it is on PCs. Photograph: Alamy    Customers have often borne the cost of the skirmishes, though. Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University\u2019s computer security group, has clashed with the UK\u2019s financial instutions for more than a decade, first over weaknesses in cash-machine security and more recently over banks\u2019 reluctance to accept the cost of online fraud, while they reap the profits of lower online overheads. Customers who have been defrauded often have to fight for their refunds, Anderson says. Many of those whose money was stolen by Hameed are still trying to get their money back, he points out. \u201cAs long as UK banks don\u2019t have to bear the cost of fraud, they won\u2019t have an incentive to improve their security,\u201d he says. He notes that the Tesco case \u2013 in which refunds were immediate \u2013 was a rare and welcome exception. He notes too, that being able to transfer money more quickly has brought significant problems. \u201cIn the old days, if you wanted to send \u00a31,000 to your aunt in Australia, it would cost you \u00a330 and take four days and you might have to visit the branch. Now it can be set up and sent in seconds. If you\u2019re a fraud victim, you can\u2019t stop it.\u201d It might sound strange for a computer security expert to bemoan faster payments. But the problem is more one of imperfect authentication: clearly, something failed at Tesco. Because thousands of customers were affected by the attack, Tesco paid up; but when a single person or business is hit by Zeus or another variant, banks often dispute it. Anderson says: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t design systems for perfect humans who can recall dozens of passwords. They should design for people as they are, faults and all.\u201d Moores says the threat to the users, and the banks, will only increase. \u201cThe attacks are going to get automated, and they\u2019re going to recruit machine learning \u2013 that stuff\u2019s not just for Google.\u201d     A customer uses a machine at a Tesco Bank cash point.

Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images    RISING TIDE OF HACKING Banks don\u2019t like to talk about online hacking, especially when it involves customer accounts. But here are some that we know of. 2013 As many as 100 banks worldwide are discovered to have been infiltrated by malware \u2013 sent as email attachments to bank employees \u2013 which sent back video and other data from internal networks. That helped hackers to steal a total of $900m, according to the Kaspersky Lab, which claims it had gone on for almost two years. Neither the amounts stolen nor the details have been confirmed. December 2014 About 730,000 login details for wealthy clients of Morgan Stanley are offered for sale online, after being stolen by an employee, 30-year-old Galen Marsh, between 2011 and 2014. Morgan Stanley says it found no evidence that customers lost any money. Marsh pleaded guilty in September 2015, receiving 36 months\u2019 probation. Morgan Stanley was fined $1m. Meanwhile, hackers in Russia and Ukraine break into the internal networks at financial institutions in their countries and infect ATMs with malware that would give them 50 times the amount they seemed to be taking out. The group is reckoned to have gained access by buying access to PCs already infected by opportunistic hackers using weaknesses in Microsoft Office and Windows. January 2015 Hackers acquire codes from Swift, the international financial network which enables transfers between banks, to get access to a bank in Ecuador, Banco del Austro, and transfer $12m out of it via Wells Fargo to banks in Hong Kong, Los Angeles and Dubai. The bank sues Wells Fargo but does not tell Swift, which only learns of the incident via a lawsuit in May 2016. April 2015 Ryanair confirms that \u00a33.3m has been stolen from it by a fraudulent transfer via a Chinese bank. Neither the bank nor Ryanair offers any information about how the fraud happened. Late 2015 The UK\u2019s National Crime Agency investigates a series of bank frauds enabled by malware called Dridex, which infects PCs and harvests online banking details from users. British accounts are reckoned to have had \u00a320m taken from them and paid to accounts in eastern Europe. February 2016 $81m is stolen from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank; investigators link the malware used to break into the systems to that used to penetrate Sony Pictures in 2014 by a hacking group called Lazarus.

Stress has traditionally been dealt with by indulging in sex, drugs and alcohol, or possibly the defenestration of a television. Now, one of the UK industry\u2019s biggest marketing companies believes a new approach is needed. Quite Great Music PR,  which has promoted Mick Jagger, Van Morrison, The Doors, Stevie Wonder and Mariah Carey among others, is to start offering its clients access to a psychotherapist amid concerns about the mental health of musicians. The need to tour frequently, the threat of career-ending reviews, plunging incomes and incessant trolling on social media put today\u2019s musicians under pressure as never before. \u201cAll musicians, without exception, are driven by strong emotions. Once they take their music into the world, they are leaving the safety and structure of the recording studio, and allowing their music to be diagnosed in so many different ways,\u201d said Pete Bassett, the founder of Quite Great. \u201cThis in itself can cause elements of mental turmoil, especially as so many artists are walking a tightrope of self-doubt and on many occasions it only takes a negative review, or now more commonly unwieldy interaction on social networking platforms, to tip them in a direction where they need to talk at length about their fears and concerns.\u201d The largest global survey of its kind by the Help Musicians charity recently found that musicians may be up to three times more likely to have depression  than the average person. More than seven out of 10 said that they had experienced anxiety and panic attacks. The singer-songwriter Kate Bush confessed last week that she had been \u201cterrified\u201d by her return to live shows two years ago. She told BBC6 Music that she was \u201cnervous every night\u201d of her residency at the Hammersmith Apollo. And former One Direction member, Zayn Malik, cancelled a concert in Dubai in September, citing his \u201cextreme anxiety\u201d about performing on his own.     Kate Bush said she was terrified by her comeback shows at the Hammersmith Apollo in London last year. Photograph: Ken McKay/Rex    Helen Brice, a psychotherapist who will work with Quite Great\u2019s clients, has specialised in helping DJs, musicians and actors for many years. \u201cMusicians tend to be the most sensitive people on the planet \u2013 and that includes people with narcissistic traits,\u201d she said. \u201cThey put themselves out there every day in front of the public. Sometimes they can\u2019t work because they\u2019ve lost so much confidence that their self-worth is just through the floor.\u201d She said there were particular issues for classical musicians. \u201cI was surprised that, with the classical singers and musicians who came to me, much of their stress, anxiety and depression seemed to be triggered by bullying within their orchestras and choruses. They\u2019re not like companies with HR departments. They don\u2019t seem to have procedures for individuals to go and report privately. If they don\u2019t feel listened to, some people have ended up being quite ill and this has turned into depression.\u201d Brice, who charges her musician clients less than half her normal rate, said much of her work with them had to be focused on the short term because of the costs involved. \u201cI end up coaching the individual into trying to get a thicker skin; how they can better manage their feeling of low self-worth or low self-confidence, but it doesn\u2019t get to the root of the problem.\u201d   Related: Adele: 'I'd be happy never to tour again'    Bassett said he hoped the new service, primarily aimed at younger musicians starting their careers, would help establish a long-term solution to improving the mental health of artists. \u201cCare and attention need to start at a much lower level, helping artists to overcome everything from stage fright to being able to handle label rejection. \u201cIf developing artists can acclimatise themselves to reaching out for support, it will help them as their career goes through its many different phases.\u201d But he acknowledged that some established artists of the past could might have benefited from the service. \u201cWith success comes a total change in lifestyle, in outlook and this in turn manifests itself in not being able to create that \u2018difficult\u2019 follow-up album as their lives have changed and hence their writing inspirations. \u201cOver the decades this has seen them turn to differing types of support mechanisms. If therapy had been one of those support mechanisms that artists from bygone eras had felt comfortable pursuing, it is likely that some of the greatest icons of music would still be here today.\u201d", "title": "Forget drugs and booze: stars use therapists to cope with stress", "sentences": ["And former One Direction member, Zayn Malik, cancelled a concert in Dubai in September, citing his \u201cextreme anxiety\u201d about performing on his own."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-13T00:04:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/13/horse-racing-tips-monday", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Musselburgh 12.50 Mitcd (nap) 1.20 Spoils Of War 1.50 Ryalex 2.20 Blue Kascade 2.50 Royal Pearl 3.20 Boss In Boots 3.50 Desert Island Dusk Newcastle 2.00 Dominating 2.30 Alsacienne 3.00 Dubai Elegance 3.30 Volition 4.00 Jordan Sport (nb) 4.30 Compas Scoobie 5.00 Napoleon Solo 5.30 Tavener Plumpton 1.05 Boudry 1.35 Wishing And Hoping 2.10 Sudden Wish 2.40 Earls Fort 3.10 Venetian Lad 3.40 Milzipa Leicester Meeting abandoned", "title": "Horse racing tips: Monday 14 November", "sentences": ["Musselburgh 12.50 Mitcd (nap) 1.20 Spoils Of War 1.50 Ryalex 2.20 Blue Kascade 2.50 Royal Pearl 3.20 Boss In Boots 3.50 Desert Island Dusk Newcastle 2.00 Dominating 2.30 Alsacienne 3.00 Dubai Elegance 3.30 Volition 4.00 Jordan Sport (nb) 4.30 Compas Scoobie 5.00 Napoleon Solo 5.30 Tavener Plumpton 1.05 Boudry 1.35 Wishing And Hoping 2.10 Sudden Wish 2.40 Earls Fort 3.10 Venetian Lad 3.40 Milzipa Leicester Meeting abandoned"], "publicationDate": "2016-11-13T16:44:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/marriott-travels/2016/nov/15/seven-surprising-facts-about-the-worlds-largest-hotel-group", "tags": [], "article": "  Related: Nine stunning hotels in striking locations \u2013 in pictures    89 years since J Willard Marriott and his wife Alice started up a root beer stand in Washington DC.

That was nice, to be able to knock that off, and to win the FedEx Cup as well was big. \u201cMy play in majors was disappointing.

Keith Pelley, the tour\u2019s chief executive, was asked precisely where a total shortfall of about $7.7m in prize money for three 2017 events alone would come from. \u201cWe, along with Rolex, are bringing them [each] up to $7m,\u201d said Pelley of the purses for the BMW Championship, the Irish Open and the Scottish Open. Therefore, a much-heralded European Tour project actually looks like costing the body \u2013 who announced a 2015 loss of nearly \u00a38m \u2013 money. With more tournaments to be added, that subsidy will grow, dependent on precisely how much Rolex are putting into this. In short, this appears a commercial punt taken on the basis that the rebranding of certain competitions may fly. And, of course, it may, but it isn\u2019t a fully safe strategy; the \u201crobust marketing and promotional\u201d plan as promised by Pelley also comes at a capital cost to someone. \u201cAll the resources for every tournament in the Rolex Series will be magnified,\u201d Pelley said. Easy translation; more money.   Related: Rory McIlroy admits he was \u2018too proud and too stubborn\u2019 over putting problem    \u201cAt this particular time we, along with Rolex, are bringing those tournaments to that level,\u201d added Pelley when pressed as to whether the existing sponsors of the events in question would subsidise the shortfall towards the $7m minimum prize fund to be part of the newly-created series. For now, and pardon the pun, those already prominent competitions have actually won a watch courtesy of the Tour and a partner. Pelley refused to even confirm how long the agreement with Rolex is for, which would hardly seem a massive breach of commercial confidentiality. Pelley remains quite the showman but close analysis of his work continues to raise queries. What this Rolex Series will actually provide, barring more money at the elite level of the Tour and enhanced media coverage which it is hoped will make golf more accessible, is a cause for debate. The gulf in resource to the PGA Tour remains vast. One could make a decent case for the batch of events as boosted, with the French Open being certain to follow, being strong enough in any case. What is being done for the poorly attended, unattractive stuff at the lower end? Pelley has to be careful not to pander only to the players at the top of his organisation. There is no overall narrative to knit the seven tournaments together and no combined prize at the end of them. The European Tour already has an order of merit, which it is stressed will retain key status. This, it is feared, could add confusion; the announcement of a second money list, lost in the Rolex melee, certainly should. Golf hasn\u2019t really grasped the concept of simplicity being king.   Related: European Tour to embrace change for 2017 but can\u2019t keep everyone happy | Ewan Murray    The Rolex series has apparent flaws. The first tournament under its umbrella isn\u2019t until May at Wentworth, with two of the European Tour\u2019s marquee competitions earlier in any given year obviously problematic for different reasons. The Dubai Desert Classic is sponsored by another luxury watch brand, Omega. The HSBC Championship in Abu Dhabi is hugely attractive to the world\u2019s best players partly because of appearance fees, which presumably would need to be ditched for the subsidy of a $2.7m prize fund unless the Tour and Rolex step forward once more. The Turkish Airlines Open was ruined in part by the refusal of certain players to travel this year on security grounds. If that stance persists \u2013 and Rory McIlroy intimated on Tuesday he wouldn\u2019t be rushing back after ill-advised comments from a leading golf administrator in Turkey \u2013 then the Rolex Series, just as with this year\u2019s Final Series, is undermined. Despite grand statements, Pelley is yet to prove he can sell golf to fresh markets. Rolex is a long-standing and loyal partner of the European Tour. The one tournament which has been seriously enhanced financially from 2017, the Italian Open, owes everything to government intervention linked to the claiming of the 2022 Ryder Cup. For all that contractual obligations tie Pelley\u2019s hands to an extent, there has been no arrival of alternative sponsorship from areas where other sports \u2013 football, primarily \u2013 have profited. Golf\u2019s profile means it should actually be an easier sell. In maintaining a theme of bullish rhetoric, Pelley insisted the Rolex Series is \u201cone of the most important initiatives in the Tour\u2019s 44-year history\u201d.

We all have a long season behind us. This is the final stretch, four rounds of golf. Whether I play great or good or average or whatever it might be, I\u2019m going to try my hardest for four days.

He is the first Swede to be granted that status. \u201cIt was going to be a big year, 2016,\u201d he added. \u201cWe had the Olympics, Ryder Cup, the majors. My mindset was I wanted to play well at those ones, and a lot of times over my career when I really put my mind to something, I managed to achieve it. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I haven\u2019t tried in the majors before but in terms of preparation and sometimes when you just know you want to peak at a certain time, you can actually make it happen. \u201cI had that important win at the BMW International in Cologne [during June]. That was a key moment for me. I had not won for a while and to get that one over the finish line, it felt like, \u2018OK, winning again is out of the window\u2019, and I just pressed on from there.\u201d Since 2012, Stenson and Rory McIlroy have been the only winners of the European Tour\u2019s season-ending event. In seven appearances McIlroy has never finished worse than 11th and is an aggregate of 108-under par.

There is an explanation for the 27-year-old\u2019s start to the DP World Tour Championship. McIlroy, by his own admission, needed snookers to retain his European Tour order of merit title and there may have been a problem with mental focus. McIlroy could have scrambled closer to level par after lying four over but for missed opportunities on a three-hole stretch from the 11th tee. He is now afforded the rarity of an early tee time for day two. In the second match of Friday, McIlroy will be reacquainted with Andy Sullivan, which will evoke some memories of the joust between the pair at this tournament 12 months ago.   Related: Rory McIlroy admits he was \u2018too proud and too stubborn\u2019 over putting problem    McIlroy was at least spared questioning as to where precisely the first 18 holes had gone astray, instead having to fulfil the demands of anti-doping control. There can be no complaint about the European Tour\u2019s drug testers focusing only on those who laugh in the face of scorecards. Lee Westwood summoned an element of annoyance from his late World Cup rejection to produce a first round of 66, which placed him a shot clear of Nicolas Colsaerts and Julien Quesne at the top of the leaderboard. The peculiar nuances of the World Cup meant that when Danny Willett announced his withdrawal last week, the top-ranked English player willing to participate could pick his partner. Chris Wood was left to make the call, with which he turned to Sullivan and scuppered Westwood\u2019s plans for the tournament in Melbourne from 24 to 27 November. \u201cI have never played in the World Cup so I was really looking forward to it,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cDanny asked me in August. I\u2019m a little bit disappointed but everybody has to do certain things for reasons and normally their own in this game. I understand.\u201d Only half a smile followed as he added: \u201cI needed to be higher in the world rankings to pick my partner. Chris probably shouldn\u2019t be expecting a pick if I am playing in the World Cup. It\u2019s up to him to pick whoever he wants. He gets on with Sully and Sully is a good player. They will have a chance. \u201cI can understand him picking a mate and he\u2019s picked a very good player. I think it\u2019s probably more to do with the rules than anything. I think the week before somebody is meant to go down there is a little late to say: \u2018No, you\u2019re not playing.\u2019\u201d Westwood\u2019s aspirations for the task in hand are boosted by his win here in 2009. The 43-year-old\u2019s first-round efforts were even more praise worthy given the absence of his long-time caddie, Billy Foster, who has been consigned to home because of a knee injury. Ken Herring, normally the bag man for Marc Warren, has stepped in. \u201cI probably have to do more, think a little bit more,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cBilly normally thinks for me, which is probably a good thing. A different caddie doesn\u2019t know my game. He\u2019s only had one round on the bag in the pro-am on Tuesday and I wasn\u2019t particularly sharp then. He\u2019s sort of making it up as he goes along but I have full confidence in him.\u201d Henrik Stenson, the leader of the order of merit going into this final tournament of the season, signed for a level-par 72. \u201cI played very average,\u201d the Open champion said. Willett, the player in closest pursuit of Stenson, fared a stroke better.

The 25-year-old tourist claimed she was attacked by two men while on holiday in the United Arab Emirates and reported the incident to police. But officers then charged the professional from Cheshire with extramarital sex and, despite being bailed, she is not allowed to leave the country. Her passport has been confiscated and UK-based UAE legal experts Detained in Dubai said she could face a prison sentence if found guilty. The family of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have set up fundraising pages online to raise money to cover her legal costs. She is currently residing in a safe house. The woman\u2019s father wrote online that his daughter had met the two men in her hotel who raped her. He claims the alleged attack was filmed. He added: \u201cShe is stranded, is not allowed to leave the country, and is alone scared, and in a dreadful situation, as you can imagine.\u201d Shortly afterwards, two men were arrested at Dubai airport. They have been named as thai boxer David Butlin, 22, and footballer Louis Harris, 24. They have both been bailed and also remain in the country. Butlin and Harris, who are cousins and both live in the West Midlands, have appeared on the Instagram page of Towie\u2019s James Argent. They were pictured at a Dubai beach club with the reality TV star. The men are understood to firmly deny the claims. A relative of Harris, who lives in Lichfield, Staffordshire, said it was a \u201cdifficult\u201d time. She said: \u201cAll I\u2019ll say is that he\u2019s a really lovely boy. We can\u2019t comment further but it\u2019s a difficult time.\u201d  One neighbour \u2013 who wished to remain anonymous \u2013 said Butlin was often flying back and forth from Dubai, where the alleged rape took place. They said: \u201cIt\u2019s always on Facebook when he goes there. It must cost a lot of money.\u201d It is understood that the UK Foreign Office is providing assistance, including the alleged victim and two UK nationals, and working with the local authorities. In a post on a fundraising page, the woman\u2019s father wrote: \u201cShe was befriended by two guys from Birmingham ... and went with them for a drink, in a hotel where they were staying, the guys concerned were travelling home in around 4/5 hours.\u201d He added: \u201c(NAME) was taken to the police station where the incident was reported, and the prosecutor is setting a date for her trial, which is a complicated scenario because of the laws of the country.\u201d After reporting the alleged assault, the woman ended up in a prison cell. Her passport was confiscated and her family claim she now faces trial. Her relative returned to the UK and she was joined in the UAE by her mother. It is understood her mother has also now returned to the UK . Her father wrote: \u201c(NAME) has been put in a safe house, but is stranded in the country for a period of between three and six months, or even longer, until a trial date is confirmed and the case is brought to court.\u201d It is claimed that the woman has had to find a lawyer to represent her and legal costs will amount to \u00a324,000. Nine days ago her father updated the fundraising page writing: \u201c(NAME) mum is now on her way back to the UK, she has spent as much time as she possibly could helping to get things moving in the right direction.\u201d Radha Stirling, founder and director of Detained in Dubai, said the woman could be stuck in Dubai for as long as six months even if she was found innocent. \u201cThere is a huge backlog in the system,\u201d she said. \u201cIf she wins the first stage, the prosecution can appeal and they often do \u2026 So by the time she is found innocent, by the time she gets her passport returned, we can be talking at least six months.\u201d Stirling said the UAE was not a safe place for women to report allegations of rape. \u201cSex outside marriage is a crime there and, therefore, if a rape allegation is made and can\u2019t be proved to be rape then it\u2019s almost automatic that the person is charged with voluntary sex outside marriage,\u201d she said. Stirling said it was hard to predict what the woman\u2019s sentence would be if she were found guilty of having extramarital sex. \u201cThey have no precedent system there so while one person can be given one year for the same allegations, another person might be given one month or six months or just a deportation or a fine.\u201d She said similar cases in the past had resulted in seven-month prison sentences and that the best chance the family had to speed up the process would be to work to put diplomatic and media pressure on the UAE government. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are supporting a British woman in relation to this case and will remain in contact with her family.\u201d In 2008 an Australian woman, Alicia Gali, was jailed for eight months in Fujairah for having an illicit sexual relationship after she reported being drugged and raped by three co-workers.

TMoCA, which has the finest collection of modern western art anywhere outside Europe and the US, boasting works by the likes of Jackson Pollock, Francis Bacon and Andy Warhol, is displaying 40 pieces by prominent Arab artists alongside 40 paintings by Iranians.  This year has brought a new low in already fractured relations between powerful countries in the Arab world and the predominantly Persian state, including a palpable animosity between Tehran and Riyadh over regional conflicts and the execution in Saudi Arabia of a Shia cleric, which led to an attack on the Saudi embassy in the Iranian capital.    Related: Tehran exhibition reveals city's hidden Warhol and Hockney treasures    Mohsen Noferesti, an official from TMoCA, said it had maintained its cultural ties with the outside world regardless of the political situation.  \u201cEven at the time of sanctions we hosted works from many parts of the world,\u201d he said. The Sea Suspended show exhibits modern Arab art from the 1940s to the 1990s from places such as Egypt, Iraq, north Africa, the Levant and the Arabian peninsula.  Noferesti said the exhibition had been warmly welcomed in Tehran and visited by hundreds of people every day.  Karim Sultan of the Sharjah-based Barjeel Art Foundation, who curated the show in collaboration with the museum and the Tehran-based Mohsen gallery, said art had the power to transcend politics.  \u201cWhat we were really aiming for was more of a cultural dialogue, to open up a conversation about art and the artists,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019d say the exhibition would have had to take place regardless of the political situation because of the importance of art. Whatever the situation is, art has a way of moving over the situation, and a lot of people engage in a different kind of conversation, perhaps in a positive way.\u201d  Sultan said various exhibitions and museums in the UAE, including in Dubai, had for some time featured works by Iranian artists. The Third Line, a Dubai-based art gallery, represents Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, who had a major exhibition at the New York museum last year. The Sharjah art foundation has displayed a major art show of Farideh Lashai.  \u201cIt\u2019s not out of a vacuum that we proposed to do a show; it comes as a response in a long cultural conversation that is taking place,\u201d Sultan said. \u201cThe exhibition that just opened in Tehran was one that came out of an impetus to continue that conversation. Tehran is a very important city in the region and a museum like TMoCA is an incredible institution that has a lot of history.\u201d    A historic moment of cultural exchange  Shiva Balaghi, art scholar     TMoCA, which was founded before the 1979 Islamic revolution under the supervision of Farah Pahlavi, the former queen of Iran, has hidden treasures bought before the revolution thought to be worth more than $2.5bn. It includes Pollock\u2019s Mural on Indian Red Ground, considered to be one of his most important works and estimated to be worth more than $250m, as well as important pieces by Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Whistler and Marcel Duchamp. In 2012, the museum took around 100 works out of its basement for a first show of its kind as part of its Pop Art &amp; Op Art exhibition, featuring works by Warhol, David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein and others. That year Pahlavi gave an interview to the Guardian about the history of the collection.  Shiva Balaghi, an independent art scholar based in the US, said the new exhibition represented a \u201chistoric moment of cultural exchange\u201d which had given audiences in Tehran a rare opportunity to see \u201cthe best of Arab art\u201d. Balaghi said Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi, the founder of Barjeel, had been a major supporter of Iranian art. \u201cOver the past decade, the UAE has emerged as an important centre for Iranian art. The galleries and collectors that are based there have helped stimulate the Iranian art market,\u201d she said.  \u201cNo doubt the art of masters like Parviz Tanavoli, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, and Farideh Lashai received greater international recognition because of their exhibitions in the UAE. Meanwhile, Dubai has become a growing art hub, where international curators have discovered a younger generation of Iranian artists like Mehdi Farhadian, Golnaz Fathi and Ala Ebtekar.\u201d     Visitors look at a painting by the Iranian artist Kazem Chalipa at the opening of the show. Photograph: Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images    Among the works on display in the modern Arab art show are the Iraqi artist Kadhim Hayder\u2019s spectacular Fatigued Ten Horses Converse With Nothing (The Martyr\u2019s Epic); the Saudi artist Mounirah Mosly\u2019s The Land of Solidities; and the UAE artist Hassan Sharif\u2019s Man. Other artists represented include Bahrain\u2019s Abdullah Muharraqi, Palestine\u2019s Asim Abu Shakra, Iraq\u2019s Raffa Nasiri and Egypt\u2019s Seif Wanly.  TMoCA is planning to lend some of its treasures to museums and galleries in Berlin and Rome in the near future. Some works were due to go on display in Berlin earlier this year but the recent resignation of Iran\u2019s cultural minister, who stepped down under pressure from hardliners, has delayed the plans.  There are concerns in Iran about the fate of its hidden treasures. Many artists, including the celebrated painter Aydin Aghdashloo, have expressed concerns about the conditions under which the paintings are held in the museum, and Lili Golestan, a prominent gallery owner, has complained about the secrecy surrounding the works.  \u201cThere is a lot of secrecy. We don\u2019t know which works are being sent [on loan]. We have asked but they don\u2019t respond,\u201d she told Isna news agency.

Cars inch forwards on gridlocked streets, slowing to a standstill to wait through a fifth or sixth light change before joining the queue beyond. Elsewhere in the Jordanian capital, similar lines choke roads, roundabouts and intersections ill-equipped to deal with the enormous traffic load in a city that has long outgrown its transport infrastructure. Strategic avoidance of traffic jams is just one of the tactics taxi drivers here employ to offset the costs of their trade. Switching off the meter, charging extra in congested areas and refusing certain destinations are practices that have earned them little popularity among passengers, who add speeding and smoking in the car to a long list of complaints. The arrival of ride-hailing platforms Uber and Dubai-based competitor Careem last year offered commuters an alternative to Amman\u2019s traditional yellow taxis and poor public transport services. But they haven\u2019t been welcomed with open arms by the existing taxi industry or the government.     Careem ride-hailing app Photograph: Careem    Crackdown on apps \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to use private cars for public transport,\u201d says Nourhan Shuqman, an advisor at Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Transport. While the apps provide a \u201cgreat service\u201d, she says, the taxis are \u201ca big sector that we cannot neglect.\u201d At the end of last year, a government crack down on ride-hailing apps saw cars impounded and drivers fined, accused of violating Jordan\u2019s Public Transport law, which states that only licensed cars can provide public transport services for a fee.  Regulations are being drawn up that would limit Uber and Careem to operating through licensed cabs, limos and hotel taxis. This would be a disappointing outcome says Ibrahim Al Manna, general manager of Careem in Jordan, adding that the company\u2019s app helps address transport shortfalls in Amman while offering work to unemployed Jordanians.  \u201cWe see great value in having Careem here \u2026 but the government needs to put the right regulations in place by giving people the freedom to decide their mode of transport, whether that\u2019s by private car or yellow taxi,\u201d he says. And despite the crackdown Careem says its has increased the number of drivers it works with. \u201cThe situation in the Middle East is very different from other parts of the world,\u201d an Uber spokesperson says, \u201cJordan offers huge potential but we need to make sure we comply with the laws.\u201d Uber says it is \u201cis 100% legal as we only work with licensed drivers.\u201d Both Uber and Careem have encountered similar challenges entering other Middle East markets, where protectionist policies have complicated their expansion across the region. But commuters in Amman have quickly grown accustomed to the high-standard service offered by the apps.  \u201cThey made life a lot easier, particularly for women,\u201d says Amman resident Nada Qaddoura, pointing to safety assurances offered by the apps\u2019 driver-tracking functions.     Women getting into an Easy Taxi Photograph: EasyTaxi    \u201cThere\u2019s no denying the growing demand and global trend towards [services using] private cars,\u201d says Mahmoud Fouz, Middle East CEO of Easy, a ride-hailing app that operates through Amman\u2019s existing yellow taxi fleet. \u201cWe are also open to exploiting this demand, but it has to happen in a structured way that doesn\u2019t destroy the existing players.\u201d The backlash from Amman\u2019s yellow taxis Last Tuesday, more than 1,200 taxi drivers took part in a protest that called on the government to ban Uber and Careem, citing an 80% decline in business since the arrival of the apps in Amman. \u201cThe situation is unfair for taxis. What the apps are doing is illegal,\u201d says Ayman Zain, a taxi driver who helped organise the protest.  Drivers also voiced longstanding demands for an increase in fares. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked many times for the rates to be raised,\u201d says taxi driver Fayez Hassan Hijazi. \u201cI have another source of income but other drivers can\u2019t manage if they live only on the taxi.\u201d Many of the problems boil down to the meter, explains Hamzah Nassif, co-founder of iMena Group, an operator of online businesses in the region, including Easy. Every time the speedometer drops below 20 km/h, the meter switches to waiting mode, which charges less than 0.019 Jordanian dinar (2p) a minute. This encourages taxi drivers, who often pay up to JOD45 (\u00a351) a day for cab hire and fuel, to haggle with passengers or refuse congested routes as they try to offset their costs for the day.     Taxi drivers protesting in Amman Photograph: EasyTaxi    Easy has addressed this by implementing an in-app pricing mechanism that\u2019s \u201cmore aligned with the realities of Amman\u2019s busy roads,\u201d says Nassif. It calculates the price according to both distance travelled and time taken, producing a higher rate all-round than the standard metere, particularly for the slow-moving mode. It\u2019s fairer than the standard meter system, he says, where prices, \u201chave been kept low in order to compensate for the lack of transportation infrastructure in the city.\u201d  Amman\u2019s urban mobility crisis Uber and Careem may pitch themselves as an answer to the capital\u2019s mounting urban mobility crisis, but the government is not convinced. It\u2019s taking steps to address the problem through the Amman bus rapid transit system, due for completion in 2018.  At present, just 350 large buses cater for a city of more than four million people and account for fewer than 5% of journeys in Amman each day, according to transport consultant Hazem Zureiqat. \u201cPublic transport has not kept up with the pace of growth in Amman,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where it has become critical to invest in it.\u201d Instead, huge funds have been channelled into bolstering the city\u2019s road network and facilitating the movement of private cars. Ayman Smadi, who until recently served as director of transportation and traffic management at the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM), fears the consequences. \u201cWe already have 1.2m registered cars in Amman and let me tell you, our streets are not made for 1.2m cars,\u201d he says. \u201cTraffic jams aren\u2019t the only issue here,\u201d he adds, referring to a 2014 government study on youth unemployment (currently around 29% in Jordan), in which approximately 55% of respondents cited transportation barriers as a primary reason for failing to keep or find a job. These are \u201ccaptive users\u201d with no alternative, says Zureiqat, who is part of the team behind a proposed new law that includes subsidising public transport to facilitate a regular and reliable service. Careem, has plans to create 10,000 jobs in the country over the next two years. Wa\u2019el Abd Al Rahman, who uses the platform to supplement his income as a computer engineer, is one of almost 2,000 drivers, or \u201ccaptains\u201d, on the company\u2019s books. \u201cAll of my relatives do this,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have a new car, are polite and qualified, then it\u2019s a way of making money easily.\u201d ", "title": "Jordan cracks down on Uber and Careem as congestion clogs its capital", "sentences": ["The arrival of ride-hailing platforms Uber and Dubai-based competitor Careem last year offered commuters an alternative to Amman\u2019s traditional yellow taxis and poor public transport services."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-18T06:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/19/victor-dubuisson-dubai-rory-mcilroy", "tags": ["Golf", "Rory McIlroy", "Lee Westwood", "Sport"], "article": "Tales of Victor Dubuisson\u2019s demise may be greatly exaggerated.

The 26-year-old served notice that he remains a force to be reckoned with in Dubai, courtesy of a 64 at the DP World Tour Championship. Dubuisson, who has slipped to 93rd in the world, holds a one-shot lead over Tyrrell Hatton, Matthew Fitzpatrick and another renaissance man, Nicolas Colsaerts, with 18 holes to play. Colsaerts and Fitzpatrick arrived in contention courtesy of 66s, with Hatton faring one shot worse. This is quite the congested picture. As darkness fell at the end of the third day, which had been disrupted by morning desert fog, 11 competitors were within five shots of Dubuisson\u2019s 13-under-par aggregate. The prospect of further weather issues on Sunday morning means that the final round will be\u00a0played\u00a0in three-balls; ominously for the\u00a0European Tour, given the timing delays that may ensue, a play-off has to be a live possibility.

Stenson is five under par, which, crucially, is now six clear of Danny Willett with that Race to Dubai crown in mind. The Masters champion slipped to a 76 on day three, continuing what has been a curiously inconsistent spell.

How the 22-year-old from Sheffield, who has now returned three European Tour wins inside only 13 months, has enjoyed the last laugh.   Related: Henrik Stenson\u2019s \u2018best year of my career\u2019 after second Race to Dubai win    Fitzpatrick\u2019s refusal to follow convention was illustrated in 2013, when he left the US college system after just one term. Eyebrows were raised, criticism was forthcoming; yet Fitzpatrick has been proven entirely correct in pursuing his dreams by turning professional immediately after the 2014 US\u00a0Open, which he contested as an amateur. In Dubai on Sunday, he further endorsed his blossoming status. His success at the DP\u00a0World Tour Championship, achieved with a wonderful up-and-down from a greenside bunker at the 72nd hole, means he became the youngest Englishman to claim three European Tour titles. The man from whom he has taken that record is hardly an unknown: Nick Faldo. Fitzpatrick will now move inside the top-30 ranked players in the world. The best thing about him? An unaltered, grounded character which renders him so appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s actually two years to the day that I got my Tour card,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, who closed with a 67 to win by one at 17-under par. \u201cWhen I think about that, it is crazy. Obviously I\u2019ve won the final event of the year and two years ago, I was just getting on the Tour and I happy to keep my card. \u201cThis gives me confidence to push even further and further. Everything has just happened so fast. The 18th green was the most nervous I\u2019ve been over a four-foot putt, ever, in my career. You need to pull it off and fortunately, so far so good. It won\u2019t always work out that way.\u201d Before winning the British Masters last October, Fitzpatrick was driving a Ford Mondeo and relying on sponsors\u2019 invites for tournament places. Even now, he still lives with his parents; as referenced as he revisited that topic of vehicles. \u201cAfter the British Masters, I traded the Mondeo for a BMW X4,\u201d Fitzpatrick explained. \u201cThen the dealership gave me a brand new X5, which I drove from Warrington to home. My insurance people said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Yeah, they are very high targets for being stolen.\u2019 Mum and dad weren\u2019t too keen on having that on their drive so we sent that one back.\u201d Fitzpatrick was not the only one afforded to celebrations. Henrik Stenson closed his season in style with a 65 which also confirmed his status as the European Tour\u2019s order of merit winner. That carries a \u00a3986,000 bonus. \u201cIt has been a great year, the best of my career,\u201d the Open champion said. \u201cI always thought it was going to be hard to top 2013 but I feel like I\u2019ve done that. It feels lovely to finish this way.\u201d           Henrik Stenson hails 2016 as his best year yet after Race to Dubai win    Given Stenson and Fitzpatrick have a coach in common, the former is well placed to comment on the Yorkshireman\u2019s brilliance. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see my Ryder Cup foursomes partner come up with the goods here,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cThe last 15 months or so has been phenomenal for him. He\u2019s got big potential. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing the power game but he\u2019s hitting a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and putting well. He has got a solid short game.

If big classes drain your energy, you could become a tutor, supporting one child at a time. You could teach deaf or visually impaired children, or even be a teacher on a film set, in a hospital or at a museum. There are many ways to teach outside a traditional setting. If you want to leave education ... For some teachers, a complete change is the answer. It\u2019s unhealthy to stay in any job if your head or heart is no longer in it. If this is how you feel, ask yourself if there is something in your life that you could expand \u2013 consider your degree subject, any hobbies you have, your organisational skills, and so on.

Circus performer Tired of being stuck in a classroom? If you are physically fit, coordinated, and enjoy being in the spotlight, this could be your next career move. Training is offered on short courses, masterclasses, summer schools and workshops. Performers are usually paid per show, at a rate between \u00a3200 and \u00a31,000. Street theatre, festivals, parties and corporate events offer more work than traditional circuses.  Exam marker If you don\u2019t mind marking, this could be a great way to boost your income and your continuous professional development. If you\u2019 are a qualified teacher with three terms of recent teaching experience, you can apply. You can expect to earn up to \u00a31,000 per season, roughly one or two weeks over the summer, as a new marker. This can increase significantly as you gain experience and mark more complex papers. Insurance claims handler Always been organised and on top of your to-do list? Perhaps insurance is the answer. You will liaise with policyholders to check the validity and accuracy of claims, coordinate tradespeople and replacement goods, and arrange payments following accidents or burglaries.

Just across the alleyway is the stone seawall that was reinforced and heightened after 2007, but is already cracking, buckling and leaking. The fortification is all that stands between these homes and the waters of Jakarta Bay, which lap just beneath the rim on the other side. Filthy water already seeps through the cracks continuously, leaving streams of muddy run-off flowing in front of Sukaesih\u2019s shop.

Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    Forget Venice, which is slowly dropping into its watery foundations at an estimated rate of 2mm per year. That\u2019s a drop in the ocean compared to Indonesia\u2019s capital, particularly its northern belt, where four million people live in neighbourhoods that are now up to four metres below sea level. Areas of north Jakarta, including the seawall designed to protect them, are sinking at an estimated 25cm a year. \u201cI have been here since 1981 but I don\u2019t know how long we can stay. The water gets higher every year,\u201d Sukaesih says \u2013 referring to the danger that is, in fact, posed by the ground sinking beneath her feet. Jakarta is sinking because of subsidence. The city does not pipe in enough drinkable water, so Jakartans rely largely on wells which extract water from shallow aquifers. The result: the land above it collapses.    As the sinking continues, the danger of a catastrophic flood grows    The problem is exacerbated by the explosion of new apartment blocks, shopping malls and even government offices, which \u2013 despite official restrictions on groundwater extraction \u2013 not only draw water from this porous ground but also add to the weight compacting it. The concretisation of Jakarta has also led to increased run-off, making flooding worse while not replenishing the ground water supplies. As the sinking continues at a rate unparalleled in any other urban area in the world, the danger of a catastrophic flood grows, caused not by devastating seawater surges or storms \u2013 but by monsoon rain-swollen rivers bursting their banks because gravity no longer helps them flow out into the bay. There is a desperate need to supply potable water to the city from reservoirs to the east and west. But while plans for pipelines remain in the pipeline, some experts claim Jakarta is careening towards the point of no return.     A mother and a child walk on a flooded street during a high tide in Muara Angke, North Jakarta. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    The city: \u2018Two years to save northern Jakarta\u2019 Set in a basin of low-lying plains criss-crossed by 13 rivers, Jakarta \u2013 home to 10 million, with a total of 30 million living in the sprawl of Greater Jakarta \u2013 owes its existence to its waterfront location and geography. The natural harbour was for several centuries an important port for its Hindu and then Muslim rulers, before Dutch settlers seized control and established the trading post of Batavia as capital of their East Indies territories. The perils of flooding are as old as the city. The Dutch, the masters of such challenges at home, built a network of canals in an attempt to control the flow of waters, but never mastered them. Now, as the city sinks so dramatically, Dutch engineers and businessmen are again offering their proposals to defeat encroaching waters and reclaim land.  \u201cWe all knew that Jakarta was sinking back in the 90s and indeed earlier, but nobody was that worried or really had any idea of the extent,\u201d says JanJaap Brinkman, a hydrologist with the Dutch research institute Deltares, who has spent most of his adult life working on Jakarta\u2019s watery woes.    With more than 50 people dead and 300,000 forced to evacuate their homes, 2007 was a startling wake-up call    \u201cThen came the floods in 2007. When we studied the data and looked at the mapping, we discovered the city was sinking not perhaps by a centimetre or so per year, as had previously been thought, but by 5-10cm on average, and much more in places.\u201d With more than 50 people dead and 300,000 forced to evacuate their homes as waters covered more than a third of the city, 2007 was a startling wake-up call. The solution on paper was simple \u2013 the city must supply clean piped water, and end its dependency on groundwater extraction. Tokyo did just that in the 1960s after sinking more than four metres during the 20th century. Within a decade, says Brinkman, pointing to graphs on his laptop, that downward trajectory was permanently halted. But in Jakarta, there has been no significant progress in the nine years after the floods, thanks to a combination of financial restraints, competing infrastructure demands, and the sclerotic impact of the highly decentralised system of government introduced in response to the Suharto dictatorship. Brinkman, his good humour at times tested by this inertia, says there are now only two years left to act, or it will be too late to save northern Jakarta from disaster.   Jakarta's Great Garuda seawall plan   There is another dramatic and controversial plan to save the world\u2019s fastest-sinking city from itself: the so-called Giant Sea Wall and Great Garuda projects. At the heart of the proposals \u2013 with an estimated cost of as much as $40 billion \u2013 is a massive dike arcing 25 miles across Jakarta Bay which would create a vast manmade lagoon, with a new coastal megacity to be built around it on reclaimed land. The project, officially known as the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD) programme, was backed with aid from the Dutch government, embraced by Indonesia\u2019s president Joko Widodo, a former governor of Jakarta, and is now being championed by a Dutch-led consortium. The land reclamation dates back to a stalled plan from the President Suharto era to create 17 new islets off the city\u2019s coastline. But it has morphed into a much more ambitious concept for a colossal new waterfront city, fanning out from sea wall in the shape of a garuda \u2013 the mythical bird of Hindu origin that is the country\u2019s national symbol \u2013 with a multilane ring road for the perennially traffic-clogged capital running along its rim.     Residents fill up a water tank with clean water. North Jakarta is sinking, mostly due to overconsumption of ground water. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    From above, the designers\u2019 illustrations for the Great Garuda project are redolent of the artificial Palm islands off the shore of Dubai. Its prospective developers also looked closer to home for inspiration, planning to build glitzy skyscrapers, luxury flats, shopping malls and attractions similar to Singapore\u2019s Sentosa Island.  Champions say the Giant Sea Wall will soon be the only way to save the city from catastrophic floods sweeping across the northern belt of land, with the new islands providing the financing by tapping into the monies of property development tycoons. But the schemes are now mired in lawsuits, scandals and moral controversy \u2013 particularly over the mass evictions of traditional fishing villages and waterfront communities, many of which have been bulldozed flat. Critics \u2013 a broad coalition of Indonesian scientists, land activists and local residents \u2013 say it is an outlandish and unnecessary project that would wreak environmental and social disaster. They argue the lives of traditional fishing communities are being destroyed as mass evictions are imposed, with whole neighbourhoods razed and residents relocated more than 10 miles away. They also claim that walling off the bay would turn it into a \u201cseptic lagoon\u201d of trapped freshwater. With little sewage treatment for the river water pouring into the bay, this corporate attempt to \u201csanitise\u201d Jakarta\u2019s waterfront could end up having exactly the opposite effect.     A worker cleans up trash on a recently revitalised river in West Jakarta. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    The rivers: \u2018Everyone agrees we need to do this now\u2019 What is not in dispute is the need for urgent action. Just in front of the old fortification at Muara Baru, thick new pilings are being driven into the seafloor to provide a higher and stronger defence against the waters. Few people object to this, the start of Phase A of NCICD programme. \u201cThis is the \u2018no regrets\u2019 stage, as everyone agrees that we need to do this now,\u201d says Tuty Kusumawati, head of the Jakarta planning department, as she pores over maps and diagrams of the waterfront. To deal with the freshwater flooding, heavily polluted and rubbish-strewn rivers are being widened, dredged, cleaned and protected with new concrete barriers, in initiatives ordered by Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the governor known to all by his nickname, Ahok.    Some critics in its former colony are sceptical about the motives of Dutch government-funded consultants and businessmen    For the smaller rivers that have already sunk too far to flow out to sea, pumping stations and polders are being built, with reservoirs to hold water at times of heavy rain and flooding. But some experts say there aren\u2019t large enough pumps or sufficient land available to deal with the larger rivers \u2013 hence the call for more dramatic intervention. When presented with the proposal for the Giant Sea Wall, the Indonesian government asked the Dutch consultants to deliver a more ambitious concept to accompany it. From that request, the design for the Great Garuda was born.  The Netherlands is an undisputed bastion of international expertise on fighting the seas and land reclamation. But in its former colony, some critics have expressed scepticism about the motives of the Dutch government-funded consultants and businessmen proposing such a colossal scheme. Victor Coenen, the project manager for Witteveen+Bos, the engineering consultancy that heads the Giant Sea Wall consortium, shrugs off the criticism. \u201cFine, if they don\u2019t want our help, then we can go elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is the Indonesian government that has asked for Dutch assistance to deal with the flooding, and it is Dutch government money that is helping.\u201d     \u2018If they don\u2019t want our help, then we can go elsewhere,\u2019 says Victor Coenen, project manager of Dutch engineering consultancy Witteveen+Bos. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    This week\u2019s visit to Indonesia by a high-profile Dutch trade mission, headed by the prime minister, Mark Rutte, is giving fresh impetus to the debate. The Save the Jakarta Bay Coalition, an alliance of groups opposed to the scheme, has written to Rutte spelling outs their fears and criticisms. \u201cThe Dutch are well known for their flood mitigation measures,\u201d the letter notes. \u201cThese measures adopt a complex approach, which follows the principles of environmental and social protection and good governance. [But] what is happening in Indonesia is entirely the opposite. We are deeply concerned about the livelihood loss and infringement of human rights, as well as irreparable environmental damage, caused by the project. \u201cWe therefore stress that, if your government and the Indonesian government insist on building the NCICD, tens of thousands of people connected to small-scale fisheries will lose their livelihood.\u201d The widening and fortification of the city\u2019s rivers has already seen the eviction of thousands from kampung communities that have sprung up along its rivers and reservoirs. Bulldozers are often deployed with just a few days notice and residents ordered to move to new concrete public housing, often miles away from the waterfront where they work.  According to Brinkman, however, \u201cThere are only two options, retreat or advance. We either abandon and evacuate north Jakarta, which is a non-starter, or we advance out into the bay with the seawall.\u201d     A man collects plastic bottles on Island G, one of 17 artificial islands. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    The bay: creating a septic lagoon? At Muara Baru, Coenen outlines the arguments for NCICD\u2019s Phase B \u2013 the Giant Sea Wall \u2013 as he conducts a tour of the current fortifications. \u201cIn the old days, the water ran out to sea,\u201d he says. \u201cNow water collects in the city from several of these rivers. It can\u2019t get out so we pump it out. But for the large rivers, we need ever-higher riverbanks and ever-bigger pumping stations and storage lakes.  \u201cWe can\u2019t build up riverbanks that are five or seven metres above the neighbouring communities, and there is not enough space onshore for the pumping lakes. So we\u2019re proposing the Giant Sea Wall to create what is effectively a giant pumping lake offshore. Then we can then lower the water level, so those rivers can flow again.\u201d    If we can restore the bay and its polluted waters, that would mean something good for civilisation in Indonesia  Alan Koropitan     But this part of the project has been met with scepticism by some prominent Indonesian scientists. Alan Koropitan, professor of oceanography at Bogor Agricultural University, contends the solution for Jakarta Bay is \u201crestoration, not reclamation\u201d. He says building an outer sea wall and manmade islands would create greater pollution and sedimentation as waters are trapped inside the dike, rather than being flushed out to sea. \u201cIf, instead, we can restore the bay and its polluted waters, that would mean something good for civilisation in Indonesia. I believe that a new economy will come from that \u2013 in tourism, aquaculture and fisheries.\u201d Muslim Muin, head of coastal engineering research at the Bandung Institute of Technology, is equally unimpressed with the multibillion-dollar proposal. \u201cIf the Giant Sea Wall is built, it would inflict huge construction and operational costs and serious environmental costs. Even worse, it would exacerbate Jakarta\u2019s flood risk. \u201cBy building the reservoir, the circulation of water will drastically decrease and even reach a point when it becomes stagnant water. The natural cleansing process would no longer happen,\u201d he adds, citing the water-borne malarial epidemics of Dutch days.     A seawall is under construction in Muara Baru. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    Coenen too acknowledges the environmental dangers of a \u201cseptic lagoon\u201d that could be created by walling off the bay. But he contends that the wall should be accompanied by measures such as water sanitation. \u201cThe point really is that very soon, we will have no choice,\u201d he adds. It is not just an environmental controversy, however. The Giant Sea Wall plans have become entwined with ever-more ambitious, and contentious, schemes for a radical facelift for the whole waterfront. The residential move south away from Jakarta\u2019s coast began with Dutch colonialists in the 19th century, who preferred to live in greener areas less prone to disease and flooding. It was a trend that continued after independence in 1945, with most Indonesians choosing to live in what is now South, East and West Jakarta. That left behind a coastline dominated by the city\u2019s industrial port and harbour, and populated by fishermen\u2019s slum dwellings. The notable exception was the Indonesian-Chinese community that plays a powerful role in the country\u2019s business world, including property development.    Prosecutions exposed murky financial ties between the developers and Jakarta city budgets    The city\u2019s ethnic Chinese have long lived near the bay and many influential families are based there in exclusive gated communities and nautical-themed luxury apartment blocks bearing names such as Regatta and Green City. Talk of a new waterfront city of 17 manmade islets, jutting up to two miles out into the bay, began in the mid-1990s. The project stalled after the Asian economic crisis but was later revived with an added twist \u2013 it could be deployed to garner private funding for the NCICD in a country where government coffers are always stretched. Huge industrial dredgers moved into the bay to discharge their loads and start creating the first four islands in 2013, but that work was brought to a jarring halt last April. A moratorium was declared in the wake of a high-profile and ongoing corruption case involving a company executive from one of the showpiece developments bribing a local parliamentarian over zoning laws. The prosecutions exposed murky financial ties between the developers and Jakarta city budgets. The government said the reclamation would start again in September, but as yet there has been no more work on the scheme. So the four part-built islands sit in Jakarta Bay, unfinished and off-limits.      A scale model of a waterfront city planned for one of the 17 artificial islands, Island G. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    The islands: high-rises, gated compounds and marinas Visitors entering the air-conditioned oasis of the Riverwalk Bay shopping mall, at the base of the Green City complex in the waterfront Pluit district, can cast their eye over a model (pictured above) of how the NCICD\u2019s \u201cIsland G\u201d \u2013 marketed as Pluit City \u2013 looks in the designers\u2019 eyes. It is a futuristic extravaganza of gleaming modernist high-rises, gated villa compounds and yacht marinas. A security guard hovers to enforce the \u201cno photographs\u201d rule, so for a close-up view of Island G, it is necessary to head out into the bay with Suhali bin Urip, a local fisherman who has worked these waters for 30 years.  The 58-year-old Suhali \u2013 his face creased beyond his years by decades at sea under the tropical sun \u2013 is a prominent voice in the \u201cno reclamation\u201d campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who live and work here, but nobody is consulting us about our futures,\u201d he says. \u201cThe elite, the politicians and the rich, are making the decisions, but they don\u2019t care about us or understand us.\u201d     Fisherman Ari Sapilah in Muara Angke. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    Suhali lives with his family in the fishing village of Muara Angke, where men make on average $25 to $40 a month working on boats that are now forced to venture ever-further out to sea in search of a catch. Shanty dwellings of plywood, breeze blocks and corrugated metal, often lashed together by rope or metal fixtures furnished from scrap, are precariously balanced on wooden stilts over a waterfront that serves as toilet and rubbish dump. Suhali\u2019s small wooden skiff, its paint peeling and decking loose, is tethered at the end of a rickety path of bamboo poles and old door frames. He yanks a few times on the starting cord of the outboard engine, and we sputter off into the bay towards our target \u2013 our progress in these sensitive waters observed by a police motorboat.    Now they are building this land in our waters there are no fish left to catch here  Suhali     The future Pluit City soon comes into view, although for now the islet is no more than a low spit of reclaimed sand sitting a few feet above water level, with the Regatta and Green City developments looming on the skyline behind it. \u201cI used to fish just here,\u201d Suhali says, his tiny boat bobbing offshore. \u201cBut now they are building this land in our waters, there are no fish left to catch here.\u201d During our trip, we encounter only one fisherman casting his nets \u2013 as much in hope as expectation of a catch. The only other person working out here is a scavenger in a rowing boat, collecting washed-up plastic products to sell for recycling. In ongoing lawsuits objecting to the island reclamation scheme, the Jakarta Legal Aid association has argued these new islands are occupying traditional fishing grounds, while the sediment and dredging work have driven away fish from the remaining waters.     A billboard advertises the proposed waterfront city.

The waterfront developers are nearly all Chinese-Indonesians \u2013 as is Ahok, the blunt-speaking governor \u2013 while the local communities facing displacement are overwhelmingly Indonesian Muslims. Furthermore, the swanky new developments planned for the manmade islands are being marketed not just at affluent Indonesians but, with a particular thrust, at overseas Chinese buyers from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and mainland China, via aspirational television advertising that gushes in Mandarin about the vision of a \u201cnew lifestyle\u201d in Pluit City.     A neighbourhood razed by the government in an effort to revitalise the city\u2019s rivers. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    The evictions: like a scene from a wartime blitz While the battle over the shape of Jakarta\u2019s seafront is still being waged, its governor is already making his mark with controversial measures to tackle flooding challenges inland. The city\u2019s rivers have long been throttled by both rubbish and people. Tens of thousands of Jakartans set up home near and beside water, sometimes building out on stilts. These unofficial kampungs developed into thriving, if dirt-poor, communities where people live and work.  Some residents used the water to dump their rubbish and their sewage, resulting in a foul-smelling, insanitary and unsightly network of rivers and canals that also contributed to the city\u2019s chronic floods, as their waters could not drain properly and their flow was narrowed by the encroachment of homes and factories. Of course, many other Jakartans also contributed to the pollution problem, but it was these impoverished kampung that took the official blame.    It\u2019s unfortunate, but you have to destroy some areas to save the city  Victor Coenen     Ahok deployed squadrons of workers to clean the rivers of their choking surface carpets of rubbish and water hyacinths. It is one of several \u201cquality of life\u201d initiatives that also include establishing a city hotline that locals can call to report problems.  But in the governor\u2019s brusque, \u201cget it done\u201d approach to city planning, he has also overseen mass evictions from overcrowded waterside kampung. Officials said the location of homes on the edge of waterways compounded flooding risks, while the residents were in direct danger from the inundations. Ahok has followed advice from consultants to widen and raise the rivers and install levees, so that storm-swollen waters can flow out to sea or be stored safely. Across Jakarta, such concrete slabs are being put in place in riverbanks by heavy-lifting equipment.     View of a riverside slum neighbourhood in Muara Baru, North Jakarta. Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    At City Hall, Kusumawati, the planning chief, outlines the plans for rehousing residents from riversides, as well as detailed projects to employ fishing communities displaced from the seafront. \u201cWe are looking after our citizens,\u201d she says. \u201cThese new homes are better than the slums where many have lived.\u201d Coenen, meanwhile, offers a blunt assessment of the challenge facing Jakarta. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but you have to destroy some areas to save the city,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are technical solutions to technical problems. But the city also needs social solutions to social problems.\u201d His words are of no comfort to residents of areas such as the Akuarium neighbourhood, near the old Sunda Kelapa harbour at the mouth of the Ciliwung river. Hundreds of homes, including some not next to the water, were demolished here earlier this year as residents and security forces clashed. Today, Akuarium resembles a scene from a wartime blitz. Many locals are still squatting among the debris, while some are rebuilding homes from salvaged metal and brick on the ruins of their old ones.  The suspicion is widespread that they were evicted to make way for tourist projects in an area near old red-tiled Dutch buildings of the colonial era, rather than to keep rivers flowing and combat flooding. Officials have told evictees to move to subsidised apartments in low-cost, concrete public housing blocks that are being built across the city. But the new housing offered to some slum residents is up to 12 miles away, in locations that would take the people of Akuarium far away from the waters where they work in the fishery and tourism businesses.

Johariah ekes out a living to support her family by selling salted fish. Others living amid the debris tell a similar story; that they rely on being close to the water. The abrupt manner of the house clearances, with bulldozer squads dispatched along with armed police protection after only a few hours\u2019 notice, has deepened the anger \u2013 as have rows over ownership and compensation. The authorities describe these kampung residents as squatters on government land. But many have lived here for years, even decades, and insist their right to residence was approved by city agencies that levied annual property taxes. Some angrily wave their tax bills; others say they bought their homes and even received bank loans for them. \u201cThey say we did not have the right to be here, but I paid for my home,\u201d says Johariah. \u201cYou can\u2019t treat us like this.\u201d Graffiti denouncing Ahok \u2013 as he is known to friend and foe alike \u2013 is daubed across the walls here. Islamist parties have capitalised on the outrage to fuel their campaign against the governor, who is the most prominent Christian in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation, and enjoys high popularity ratings in much of the city.

Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    Last week, police named him as a criminal suspect in a blasphemy investigation, for an aside he made about his political opponents citing the Koran. The governor, who is running for re-election in February, now faces prosecution on charges that can carry up to five years in jail. The case is expected further to complicate Jakarta\u2019s waterfront facelift plans. For now, reclamation work on the 17 islets remains on hold, amid reported splits within the president\u2019s cabinet \u2013 although Jokowi\u2019s support is expected to win the day. It is telling that Luhut Pandjaitan, the co-ordinating maritime minister and a close confidant of the president, has insisted the moratorium will be lifted. \u201cThere is no reason for us not to continue with the reclamation of the North Jakarta coast,\u201d he said in September.  \u201cIt is estimated that all of North Jakarta will sink below sea level by 2030,\u201d the president himself said at a cabinet meeting earlier this year. \u201cBecause of that, the development of the capital\u2019s seaside, which has been delayed for so long, is the answer for Jakarta.\u201d   Related: Jakarta at 30 million: my city is choking and sinking \u2013 it needs a new Plan B    But a follow-up cabinet session, expected to take place in late October to confirm the government\u2019s position on the NCICD, did not materialise. In the always opaque world of Indonesian politics, the power battles behind the scenes remain hidden. There is now speculation that the decision on the Giant Sea Wall will be delayed for a year or more, allowing time for further investigations into the impact on the environment and the people of the seafront. The Great Garuda development that was supposed to take flight from that dike could be grounded even longer. Back in the ruins of Akuarium, as Johariah surveys the scene from her makeshift fish stand, local tour guides lead European visitors through the rubble, en route from the nearby maritime museum to the boat dock for the old harbour. It is a jarring juxtaposition in the struggle over Jakarta\u2019s waterfront future. And all the time, as the view of the crumbling seawall from Sukaesih\u2019s shopfront shows all too clearly, this city is still sinking. Do you live in Jakarta?

In an attempt to derail the \u201chonour killing\u201d trial, the family of Bradford-born Samia Shahid hopes to discredit her husband, Mukhtar Syed Kazam, by demanding police investigate their claim that she was in an illegal relationship with him. The person who first reports a crime, in this case Kazam, has a particularly important status in Pakistani law because the information they provide forms the basis for a document which obliges police to launch an inquiry. Masroor Shah, the family\u2019s lawyer, said they would prove that divorce documents from her first marriage, provided by Kazam, were forged and undermine his credibility in court. \u201cIf we can show that her first marriage was not lawfully terminated in Pakistan or the UK then the fact that [Kazam] has himself admitted cohabiting with an already married woman is a very, very serious offence under Pakistani law,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the witness box, if he comes and testifies, it will be very easy for us as defence counsels to shackle the credibility of that witness. If we show he was lying in one context he may not be believed in another context.\u201d The family hoped the legal action might even deter Kazam from returning to Pakistan from his home in Dubai to give evidence against them, Shah added. Kazam denies the family\u2019s claim of forgery, and has maintained his marriage to Shahid was legal. Shahid was found dead in her father\u2019s house in the village of Pandori on 20 July. Local police initially accepted the family\u2019s claim that the healthy 28-year-old had died unexpectedly. But following pressure from Shahid\u2019s MP in Bradford, an investigation by senior Pakistani police officers concluded she was the victim of a \u201cpremeditated and cold-blooded honour killing\u201d. The Pakistani police report alleged she had been raped and murdered by her first husband, a cousin called Mohammad Shakeel, whom her family had arranged for her to marry in 2012.  The high-level investigation also alleged that Shahid\u2019s father, Mohammad Shahid, had held her down while Shakeel strangled her to death. The two men have been in custody for months. Although they have been charged, they are yet to be formally indicted by the court hearing their case. Their lawyer says they will be pleading not guilty. The police report claims that the family tricked Shahid into leaving the safety of Dubai, where she was living with Kazam, to visit them in their ancestral village by falsely claiming her father was gravely ill. The family never recognised Shahid\u2019s divorce from Shakeel in 2014 or her subsequent marriage to Kazam, who was not only not a member of their clan but also a Shia Muslim. Shah said the family\u2019s deep sense of shame over her divorce and remarriage had made them determined to take legal action against Kazam. \u201cIt is very important for them to regain the esteem of society and regain the family honour that they feel they have lost,\u201d he said. The re-investigation of the case by senior police officers concluded that Shahid had legally divorced. The family responded by first taking the matter to a local court before going to the Lahore high court, which ruled in their favour. Although claims of \u201chonour\u201d killings are common and often not properly investigated in Pakistan, the Shahid case attracted intense interest after Naz Shah, MP for Bradford, wrote to the country\u2019s prime minister Nawaz Sharif demanding action. The MP, who also met Pakistan\u2019s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, in London last week, said the Pakistani government remained determined to get justice for Shahid.", "title": "Samia Shahid:  family force Pakistani police to investigate marriage", "sentences": ["If we show he was lying in one context he may not be believed in another context.\u201d The family hoped the legal action might even deter Kazam from returning to Pakistan from his home in Dubai to give evidence against them, Shah added.", "The police report claims that the family tricked Shahid into leaving the safety of Dubai, where she was living with Kazam, to visit them in their ancestral village by falsely claiming her father was gravely ill."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-22T13:41:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/22/homecoming-podcast-david-schwimmer-oscar-isaac", "tags": ["Podcasts", "David Schwimmer", "Radio", "Culture", "Internet", "Podcasting"], "article": "Oscar Isaac, Catherine Keener and David Schwimmer are starring in the next big blockbuster, but you won\u2019t need to buy a movie ticket to see it. The actors, along with Arrested Development\u2019s David Cross and the comedian Amy Sedaris, are all starring in a new podcast called Homecoming, which is Gimlet Media\u2019s first foray into scripted dramas, a modern take on the old-time radio dramas. Scripted dramas are experiencing a second act in the world of podcasts, with creators embracing a format that\u2019s now attracting bigger-name talent. The new life of audio dramas started with the strange fictional world of Welcome to Night Vale, which launched back in 2012. (In 2014 the Guardian called it \u201can unsettling radio drama masquerading as a local community news programme\u201d.) As the genre became more popular, Welcome to Night Vale\u2019s production company started releasing more dramas, including Alice Isn\u2019t Dead, Within the Wires and The Orbiting Human Circus.    Related: Welcome To Night Vale, the podcast that's like a local news Twin Peaks    They\u2019re not the only ones to mine the drama genre, though. Shows such as the supernatural investigation of The Black Tapes, the tech-thriller LifeAfter, the blockbuster mysteries Limetown and Archive 81, and Secrets, Crimes, and Audiotape \u2013 an umbrella series of comedic and dramatic stories told over several episodes, which launched with a story told by real-life husband and wife Jenna and Bodhi Elfman \u2013 are all creating intricate worlds and captivating drama. Audio dramas aren\u2019t just for adults, either: there\u2019s a whole group of shows, such as Eleanor Amplified and The Unexplainable Disappearance of Mars Patel, aimed squarely at a younger demographic.  The six-episode series Homecoming, which comes from the experimental storyteller Eli Horowitz, as well as Micah Bloomberg (Creative Control) and the sound designer Mark Phillips (Serial), is Gimlet\u2019s first effort in the genre. \u201cScripted fiction is a large category in other media formats \u2013 TV, film, books \u2013 and we think it could become one in digital audio as well,\u201d says Matt Lieber, co-founder of Gimlet Media. \u201cOur colleagues at The Truth and Night Vale have already proved there\u2019s an appetite, and we wanted to give it a shot with top-caliber writers, actors and sound designers. So we did.\u201d As the show is only one episode in and the storyline is non-linear, the exact plot is still a bit of a mystery. According to Schwimmer: \u201cThey\u2019re in a research facility sponsored by the government and the military trying to study PTSD.\u201d Isaac plays Walter Cruz, a soldier who has returned home from some unnamed war zone and is struggling with post-traumatic stress.  Keener plays Heidi Bergman, a caseworker of sorts in something called the Homecoming Initiative, a reintegration project and psychological experiment that is still awaiting full congressional approval. (Homecoming also marks a reunion for Isaac and Keener, who starred in the HBO series Show Me a Hero.)  Homecoming\u2019s story is complex, with time jumps, non-linear story arcs and multiple settings, but that works well for audio dramas, which allow producers and creators with big ideas to put together ambitious projects on a shoestring budget. \u201cAudio is really great in that it gives you a lot of freedom to create environments and soundscapes and really authentic-feeling worlds in a way that could [cost] millions of dollars in a movie, but if you have a talented sound designer they can do it pretty effectively,\u201d says Horowitz.  For Horowitz, who helped push the boundaries of storytelling at McSweeney\u2019s publishing house, and created an app that released what he called \u201cweird digital novels\u201d, the scripted drama podcast was simply the next frontier in storytelling. \u201cI think it\u2019s an exciting moment in podcasting where there\u2019s the energy and the audience, but there\u2019s also a lot of room to experiment about what this form even is and what it could be,\u201d he says. The so-called golden age of radio ran from the 1920s through the 1940s (basically until the advent of television) and was driven by the popularity of radio dramas. Early soap operas, comedy shows such as Fibber McGee &amp; Molly and the work of Jack Benny, and adventure serials such as Captain Midnight (which you can still listen to thanks to online archives) ran side by side with radio presentations of Shakespeare and Sherlock Holmes, and comic-strip adaptations such as Little Orphan Annie and Dick Tracy. Orson Welles\u2019s radio program, The Mercury Theatre on the Air, famously caused a scare with its retelling of The War of the Worlds, said to have sparked panic among many listeners who didn\u2019t know the alien invasion was simply a story. Podcasts, of course, have great potential to reach listeners: Marc Maron\u2019s WTF gets between 5 and 6 million downloads a month, while Serial has reached well over 80 million people since it debuted in 2014, and people are still listening. That reach has made the format popular with producers as well as A-list talent. For in-demand actors, scripted podcasts are a way to have fun playing a new or different character with little impact on their schedules. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of radio drama before and I just find it really fun and not a huge commitment for an actor in terms of time,\u201d says Schwimmer, who has worked with LA Theater Works to record live radio dramas. \u201cI worked on this for one day and we had eight hours to do all my stuff.\u201d Similarly, according to Horowitz, while Isaac was in the middle of shooting a little movie called Star Wars he was able to carve out six hours from his schedule for a part in Homecoming. Horowitz was entirely grateful for whatever time the stars would give the project: \u201cThey had no reason to be there other than wanting to be there. It certainly wasn\u2019t for fame or fortune.\u201d   Related: No longer 'on a break': is the David Schwimmer renaissance finally here?    Schwimmer was excited to play a character that he might be a longshot for on television. \u201cI like playing this kind of character who can offer a little comic relief because of his incompetence or frustration, but also playing a guy whose motives are not necessarily altruistic,\u201d said Schwimmer. \u201cI don\u2019t get the opportunity to play characters who are reprehensible or suspect very often. I think I would make an excellent sociopath!\u201d  While he doesn\u2019t get to play a sociopath in Homecoming, Schwimmer does play a corporate true believer on a seemingly suspicious mission. To prepare for the part, he called upon his experience playing something else entirely \u2013 a giraffe. According to Schwimmer, doing voiceover work as Melman the giraffe in the Madagascar franchise helped prepare him for audio stories. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of difference between a podcast and voiceover, except there is a lot less time and money in radio dramas,\u201d says Schwimmer. \u201cAn actor has to rely on his or her imagination almost exclusively. The fun was imagining I was in an airport, imagining I\u2019m stepping on a little girl\u2019s backpack on the walkway, or pretending that I\u2019m looking for my gate or in a cab in Dubai.\u201d For Horowitz the process was a little more challenging. Before Homecoming he had never written a script (he wrote this one in TextEdit) and had never directed, admitting to Googling \u201chow do you direct?\u201d before his first day on set. \u201cThe first day of taping was Oscar Isaac and Catherine Keener at 8.30 in the morning and I had no idea what I was doing,\u201d says Horowitz, laughing. \u201cIt was only possible because I was surrounded by people who actually did know what they were doing.\u201d The result is a compelling drama that is earning a lot of buzz and is already preparing for its second season. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to picking up these characters again and bang them into each other into a different way,\u201d says Horowitz. \u201cI\u2019m really excited how it turned out and I\u2019m excited about what we do next and what everyone else does next.

He has also developed a useful capacity to ignore what he regards as unnecessary, if incessant, commentary. The worst-case scenario is: a slow start to 2017 that leaves McIlroy out of sorts before his quest for the holy grail at the Masters in April. The explanation for this scene can be predicted, that an equipment switch \u2013 as triggered by Nike\u2019s withdrawal from the market \u2013 will set back McIlroy. Just do not expect the man himself to pay much attention. \u201cPeople have even said once I changed from a Nike putter to a Scotty Cameron in September: \u2018That\u2019s why he is putting better again,\u2019\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cThat obviously wasn\u2019t the case. I could have been putting with whatever; I\u2019d done really good work with [putting coach] Phil Kenyon on my stroke and that\u2019s what turned me into at least a better putter than I was in the summer. So it is all just noise that\u2019s around you.

He will arrive at the Masters having played in at least seven tournaments in what represents an interesting alteration to the buildup for the first major of the year. McIlroy is surely destined to don at least one Green Jacket but the maiden success has naturally been the toughest to claim. For those who read plenty into body language and golfing trends, the odds should be in favour of McIlroy re-establishing himself as the best player in the world next year. Injury, the Ryder Cup and the saga relating to the Olympic Games are pertinent factors in his 2016. But another difficult year, 2013, offered McIlroy useful experience, given the switch to Nike that prompted a longer transition than the outside world was willing to accept. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d says the world No2 in response to whether 2013 was a useful learning curve. \u201cI was prepared to say: \u2018OK I will take the first three or six months of the year and if I struggle, I struggle.\u2019 I just needed to find what was right for me. \u201cOne of the great things I\u2019ve learned over the years is I can take a bigger picture of things. Say I\u2019m on tour for the next 15-20 years, three to six months isn\u2019t really that much time when you can reap the benefits. As I alluded to over the past few weeks everyone wants everything now but if you can afford yourself the chance to look into the future and say: \u2018What will benefit me down the line?\u2019 then there is value in doing it that way.\u201d McIlroy will spend a week in Dubai next month testing equipment. He has already started using TaylorMade woods and it would not be the end of the world if Nike irons remain in his bag for the new season. The four-times major winner says: \u201cThat could happen. I have two more sets of these irons so they will last me for at least five years. I go through about a set every year and a half. I really like this ball but I will test what\u2019s out there. Nike\u2019s chief golf ball engineer has gone to Callaway so I will test a few of those because I know how good he is. The ball he made for me now is really good. \u201cThe other stuff? A putter is a putter, I have switched them throughout a season. Wedges are something you have to get a bit used to but for me it is just a matter of not going into 2017 confused. I don\u2019t want that. I just want to get what I don\u2019t like out of the way, have sets of things I like and go from there. \u201cBasically my plan for the week in December is more to eliminate the stuff that I don\u2019t like. There is actually no reason for me to change at the minute. I am happy with everything in my bag, so it is just a case of looking at stuff and maybe saying: \u2018This set of irons is better than what I\u2019m using.\u2019 If I don\u2019t find anything that is then I\u2019ll keep what I have.

Sukaesih bertubuh mungil, namun ia menunjuk ke atas bingkai pintu sekitar dua meter dari permukaan tanah. Nenek berusia 60 tahun itu, yang seperti penduduk Indonesia pada umumnya hanya memiliki satu nama, tinggal di dekat laut di Muara Baru. Ruang depan kediamannya yang dialihfungsikan sebagai toko tempat ia menjual minuman ringan dan rokok kretek kegemaran penduduk lokal terlihat sederhana. Namun, toko Sukaesih berada di titik perjuangan kota Jakarta untuk bertahan hidup di atas permukaan air. Di seberang gang rumah Sukaesih berdiri dinding tanggul dari batu yang diperkuat dan ditinggikan setelah 2007, namun dinding batu itu sudah mulai retak dan bocor. Dinding itu adalah satu-satunya lapisan pelindung yang membentengi rumah-rumah di daerah Muara Baru dari air Teluk Jakarta yang ketinggiannya hanya sedikit di bawah tanggul. Air kotor sudah merembes meflalui celah-celah batu meninggalkan lumpur becek yang mengalir di depan toko Sukaesih. Saat pasang, air akan meluap membanjiri sisi tanggul. \u201cKami hidup dengan kenyataan ini setiap hari,\u201d ujar Sukaesih sambil menatap tanggul. \u201cAir masuk melalui tembok tanggul setiap saat dan meluap melewati atas tanggul saat air pasang.\u201d Namun, yang jadi masalah terbesar adalah tanggul yang melindungi Sukaesih dan komunitasnya saat ini mulai tenggelam.     Sukaesih berdiri di atas tanggul di Muara Baru tempat dia tinggal. Ketika pasang naik, airnya meluber. Foto: Kemal Jufri untuk the Guardian    Lupakan Venesia, yang perlahan-lahan terendam dengan kecepatan sekitar 2 mm per tahun. Kota itu tidak ada apa-apanya dibandingkan Ibu Kota Jakarta, terutama di daerah utara, tempat empat juta manusia tinggal di daerah-daerah yang saat ini berada sekitar empat meter di bawah permukaan laut. Area di utara Jakarta, termasuk tanggul yang didesain untuk melindungi daerah itu, tenggelam dengan kecepatan 25 cm per tahun. \u201cSaya sudah tinggal di sini sejak 1981 tapi saya tidak tahu berapa lagi kami bisa tetap tinggal di sini. Air laut bertambah tinggi setiap tahunnya,\u201d ungkap Sukaesih mengacu pada bahaya permukaan tanah yang terus menurun di bawah telapak kakinya. Jakarta tenggelam akibat penurunan muka tanah. Kota ini tidak memiliki cukup air bersih terpipa, dan warga Jakarta mengandalkan sumur tanah yang menyedot air dari akuifer atau lapisan air tanah dangkal. Akibatnya, tanah di atasnya ambles.    Seraya penurunan tanah berlangsung, bahaya bencana banjir pun membesar    Masalah ini diperkuat oleh ledakan jumlah apartemen, mal dan kantor-kantor pemerintah yang tidak mengindahkan larangan untuk menyedot air tanah serta memberikan beban tambahan pada tanah yang rapuh. Pengalihfungsian lahan menjadi daerah bangunan beton dan semen juga semakin memperparah banjir di Jakarta karena tanah tidak lagi dapat menyerap air untuk menggantikan air tanah yang tersedot.  Dengan menurunnya permukaan tanah pada kecepatan tinggi, bahaya banjir terus meningkat. Hal ini bukan disebabkan oleh meningkatnya permukaan laut atau pun hujan badai, melainkan karena sungai yang meluap akibat curah hujan tinggi. Air yang meluap merusak bantaran sungai karena tidak dapat mengalir ke muara akibat gaya gravitasi. Jakarta sangat memerlukan persediaan air bersih terpipa yang berasal dari waduk di timur dan barat kota. Namun hingga kini penyediaan air bersih tersebut masih berwujud rencana semata. Sementara itu para ahli berpendapat bahwa Jakarta telah berada pada titik kemiringan yang membahayakan.     Kota: \u2018Dua tahun untuk menyelamatkan utara Jakarta\u2019 Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    Kota: \u2018Dua tahun untuk menyelamatkan utara Jakarta\u2019 Terletak di daerah aliran yang dilewati oleh 13 sungai, Jakarta \u2013 rumah bagi 10 juta orang, dengan total 30 juta penduduk yang menempati daerah Ibu Kota dan sekitarnya \u2013 dibangun karena posisinya di tepi laut dan fitur geografinya. Pelabuhan alami yang dimiliki Jakarta menjadikan kota ini kota pelabuhan penting bagi pemimpin kerajaan Hindu dan kemudian Islam, sebelum diduduki oleh Belanda yang mengambil alih tampuk kepemimpinan dan mendirikan pos perdagangan di Batavia serta menjadikannya Ibu Kota wilayah East Indies atau Hindia Timur. Bahaya banjir sudah setua umur kota ini. Orang-orang Belanda, yang menghadapi tantangan serupa di negeri mereka, membangun serangkaian kanal untuk mengontrol aliran air, namun mereka tidak pernah dapat mengendalikan isu itu sepenuhnya. Kini, saat Jakarta tenggelam dengan kecepatan yang begitu dramatis, insinyur-insinyur dan pebisnis dari Belanda kembali menawarkan rencana mereka untuk menanggulangi air yang terus masuk ke wilayah pemukiman dan mewujudkan tanah reklamasi.  \u201cKami semua sudah tahu Jakarta perlahan tenggelam sejak awal 1990-an dan bahkan sejak sebelum itu, tapi tidak ada seorang pun yang khawatir atau paham sejauh mana permasalahannya,\u201d ujar JanJaap Brinkman, ahli hidrologi dari pusat riset Belanda, Deltares, yang menghabiskan sebagian besar usia dewasanya mempelajari isu air di Jakarta.    Dengan lebih dari 50 orang tewas dan 300.000 terpaksa mengungsi, banjir tahun 2007 menjadi tanda bahaya    \u201cLalu datanglah banjir di tahun 2007. Ketika kami mempelajari data dan mengamati peta, kami menemukan bahwa kota ini tidak tenggelam 1 cm per tahun seperti yang kami duga sebelumnya, melainkan 5-10 cm, bahkan lebih dari itu di beberapa tempat.\u201d Mengingat lebih dari 50 orang meninggal dan 300.000 orang terpaksa dievakuasi dari rumah mereka saat air merendam sepertiga kota, 2007 menjadi tahun yang memunculkan kesadaran bagi banyak orang. Solusi di atas kertas amatlah sederhana \u2013kota ini harus menyediakan air bersih terpipa dan mengakhiri ketergantungannya pada air tanah.  Tokyo melakukan hal itu di 1960-an setelah tenggelam lebih dari empat meter di abad ke-20. Dalam satu dekade, ucap Brinkman sambil menunjuk pada grafik di komputernya, penurunan itu dapat dihentikan secara permanen. Namun, tidak ada kemajuan signifikan selama sembilan tahun terakhir di Jakarta akibat kebijakan pengeluaran uang yang ketat, kebutuhan pembangunan berbagai infrastruktur serta dampak dari sistem desentralisasi pemerintahan yang muncul setelah Suharto tidak lagi menjabat. Brinkman, rasa humornya kerap diuji oleh ketidakpekaan pemerintah untuk mengambil aksi, mengatakan bahwa hanya tersisa dua tahun lagi untuk melakukan sesuatu. Bila pemerintah terus bergeming akan terlambat untuk menyelamatkan Jakarta Utara dari bencana.   Jakarta's seawall plan   Ada rencana yang begitu dramatis dan kontroversial untuk menyelamatkan kota yang tenggelam dengan kecepatan tertinggi di dunia, yaitu melalui suatu skema yang kerap disebut sebagai Proyek Tanggul Raksasa. Di jantung rencana ini \u2013 yang diperkirakan akan memakan biaya sebesar 40 milyar dolar AS \u2013 adalah tanggul raksasa sepanjang 35km melintasi teluk Jakarta yang akan menciptakan laguna buatan berukuran masif dengan area pinggiran pantai tempat wilayah pengembangan kota baru akan didirikan di atas tanah reklamasi. Proyek yang secara resmi diberi nama Pengembangan Terpadu Pesisir Ibu kota Negara atau The National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD) ini didanai oleh pemerintah Belanda dan didukung oleh Presiden Indonesia, Joko Widodo, yang juga mantan gubernur Jakarta. Saat ini proyek ini tengah diperjuangkan oleh konsorsium yang dipimpin Belanda. Tanah reklamasi merupakan rencana tertunda dari masa pemerintahan Presiden Suharto yang ingin membangun 17 pulau kecil di pesisir kota. Namun rencana tersebut telah berkembang menjadi konsep ambisius untuk mendirikan kota tepi pantai yang masif dan mencuat dari pinggir tanggul dan berbentuk burung garuda \u2013burung dalam mitologi Hindu yang menjadi symbol negara Indonesia \u2013 dengan jalan lingkar yang berlapis-lapis untuk memberikan akses bagi kendaran di pinggiran kota.     Penduduk mengisi tangki air dengan air bersih. Utara Jakarta tenggelam lebih dikarenakan konsumsi air tanah yang berlebihan. Foto: Kemal Jufri untuk the Guardian    Dari atas, ilustrasi rencana proyek \u201cGaruda Raksasa\u201d ini mengingatkan kita pada pulau Palem buatan di pinggiran pantai Dubai. Para pengembang mencari inspirasi dari kisah di dalam negeri, dan berencana membangun gedung-gedung tinggi, apartemen mewah, mal-mal serta atraksi yang mirip dengan yang ada di Pulau Sentosa, Singapura. Para pendukung proyek ini mengatakan bahwa Tanggul Raksasa satu-satunya cara untuk menyelamatkan kota dari bencana banjir yang menyapu bagian utara Jakarta, dan pulau-pulau baru akan memberikan dana pembangunan yang berasal dari para pengembang. Namun rencana tersebut terbelit serangkaian tuntutan hukum, skandal dan kontroversi moral \u2013 terutama terkait dengan pengungsian masal kampong-kampung tradisional nelayan dan komunitas tepi laut yang kebanyakan akan diratakan dengan tanah. Para kritikus \u2013yang terdiri dari ilmuwan Indonesia, aktivis tanah dan penduduk setempat\u2014mengatakan bahwa proyek itu sungguh aneh dan tidak dibutuhkan serta akan berdampak buruk bagi masyarakat dan lingkungan. Mereka berpendapat bahwa kehidupan desan nelayan tradisional akan hancur ketika pengungsiaan masa ditegakkan dan seluruh komunitas digusur dan dipindahkan sejauh 20 km dari tempat asal mereka. Mereka juga menyatakan bahwa dengan mendirikan tembok di sekeliling teluk Jakarta, area itu akan berubah menjadi laguna tempat penampungan air kotor. Dengan tingkat pengelolaan air limbah yang masih minim pada air sungai yang mengalir ke teluk, usaha untuk membersihkan pinggiran laut Jakarta bisa jadi akan memiliki dampak yang sebaliknya.     Sungai: \u2018Semua orang sepakat bahwa kita harus melakukannya sekarang\u2019    Sungai: \u2018Semua orang sepakat bahwa kita harus melakukannya sekarang\u2019 Yang tidak menjadi perdebatan adalah pentingnya untuk segera beraksi. Tepat di muka tanggul di Muara Baru, tumpukan batu diletakkan di dasar laut untuk memperkuat pertahanan dari air yang masuk. Tidak banyak orang yang keberatan dengan tindakan yang merupakan Tahap A dari program NCICD. \u201cIni adalah tahap \u2018tanpa penyesalan\u2019 ketika semua orang setuju kita perlu melakukannya saat ini,\u201d ujar Tuty Kusumawati, ketua badan perencanaan pembangunan Jakarta sambil mengamati berbagai peta dan diagram wilayah tepi pantai Jakarta. Untuk menangani banjir air tawar, sungai-sungai yang penuh sampah dan berbagai polutan lainnya tengah diperlebar, dikeruk, dibersihkan dan dilindungi dengan pembatas beton \u2013tindakan ini merupakan perintah Basuki Tjahja Purnama, gubernur Jakarta yang lebih dikenal dengan nama panggilannya, Ahok. Pada sungai-sungai kecil yang telah menurun terlalu dalam untuk dapat mengalir ke laut, serangkaian pompa dan polder serta waduk tengah dibangun untuk menampung air saat curah hujan tinggi dan banjir. Namun beberapa ahli mengatakan bahwa pompa tersebut tidak cukup besar dan tidak ada cukup lahan untuk menangani masalah sejenis di sungai-sungai yang lebih besar \u2013itulah pentingnya intervensi yang lebih dramatis.  Ketika proposal Tanggul Raksasa diperkenalkan, pemerintah Indonesia meminta konsultan Belanda untuk memikirkan konsep yang lebih ambisius sebagai pendamping ide Tanggul Raksasa. Permintaan itulah yang melahirkan desain burung garuda yang megah. Belanda terkenal sebagai pembela perjuangan melawan laut dan pembangunan lahan reklamasi, dan mereka memiliki banyak ahli di bidang itu. Namun, di negara bekas koloni Belanda ini banyak kritik yang meragukan motif para konsultan Belanda yang didanai oleh pemerintahnya serta motif pebisnis yang mengajukan proposal yang begitu kolosal.  Victor Coenen, manajer proyek Witteveen+Bos, perusahaan konsultan yang mengepalai konsorsium Tanggul Raksasa, tidak menghiraukan kritik itu. \u201cTidak masalah kalau mereka tidak membutuhkan bantuan kami, karena kami bisa mencari proyek lain,\u201d ujarnya. \u201cTapi pemerintah Indonesialah yang mendatangi Belanda untuk mencari solusi banjir dan uang pemerintah Belanda yang membantu proyek ini.\u201d     \u2018Jika mereka tidak menginginkan bantuan kami, kami bisa ke tempat lain,\u2019 kata Victor Coenen, manajer proyek konsultan teknik Witteveen+Bos Belanda. Foto: Kemal Jufri untuk the Guardian    Kunjungan minggu ini ke Indonesia oleh misi dagang Belanda yang dipimpin oleh Perdana Menteri Mark Rutte memberikan dorongan bagi perdebatan terkait proyek kolosal ini. Koalisi Selamatkan Teluk Jakarta, gabungan beberapa kelompok yang menentang rencana itu, telah menulis kepada Rutte menjelaskan ketakutan dan kritik mereka.  \u201cBelanda terkenal dengan langkah-langkah mitigasi banjir,\u201d bunyi isi surat tersebut. \u201cLangkah-langkah ini menggunakan pendekatan yang kompleks dan mematuhi prinsip-prinsip perlindungan sosial dan lingkungan serta tata laksana pemerintahan yang baik. (Namun) yang terjadi di Indonesia justru sebaliknya. Kami sangat khawatir akan hilangnya mata pencaharian dan pelanggaran hak asasi manusia serta kerusakan lingkungan yang tidak dapat diperbaiki yang disebabkan oleh proyek ini. \u201cKarena itu kami ingin menekankan bahwa jika pemerintah Anda dan pemerintah Indonesia bersikeras membangun NCICD, akan ada puluhan ribu nelayan skala kecil yang kehilangan mata pencahariannya.\u201d Pelebaran dan penguatan sungai-sungai kota sudah menjadi saksi bagi ribuan penduduk kampung yang tergusur. Mereka dipaksa pindah dalam hitungan hari dan dievakuasi ke rumah susun yang jaraknya berkilo-kilometer dari pinggiran pantai tempat mereka bekerja. Namun menurut Brinkman, \u201cHanya ada dua pilihan, mundur atau maju. Kita bisa meninggalkan proyek Jakarta Utara, yang tidak akan memberi solusi efektif, atau maju ke teluk Jakarta dan membangun tanggul.\u201d     Teluk: menciptakan laguna penampung kotoran? Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    Teluk: menciptakan laguna penampung kotoran? Di Muara Baru, Coenen menjelaskan alasan pembangunan Tahap B NCICD \u2013 Tanggul Raksasa \u2013 saat dia berkeliling melihat wilayah yang telah diperkuat. \u201cZaman dulu, air mengalir ke laut,\u201d ujarnya. \u201cKini air terkumpul di kota dari beberapa sungai. Air itu tidak bisa mengalir keluar, jadi kita harus memompanya. Namun di sungai-sungai yang lebih besar, kita membutuhkan bantaran sungai yang lebih tinggi dan pompa air yang lebih kuat serta waduk untuk menampung air. \u201cKita tidak bisa membangun bantaran sungai yang tingginya sekitar lima sampai tujuh meter di atas komunitas tepi sungai dan tidak ada cukup lahan untuk membangun waduk. Itu sebabnya kami mengajukan usul membangun Tanggul Raksasa untuk menciptakan waduk besar lepas pantai. Dengan begitu kita bisa menurunkan tinggi air sehingga sungai bisa kembali mengalir.\u201d    Jika kita bisa memulihkan kondisi teluk dan air yang terpolusi, maka ini akan berdampak baik bagi peradaban di Indonesia  Alan Koropitan     Namun bagian dari proyek itulah yang ditanggapi dengan sangsi oleh seorang ilmuwan terkemuka Indonesia. Alan Koropitan, dosen di bidang oseanografi di Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB), menyatakan bahwa solusi bagi teluk Jakarta adalah \u201crestorasi, bukan reklamasi.\u201d Menurutnya, membangun tanggul dan pulau buatan akan menciptakan polusi yang lebih tinggi den menimbulkan sedimentasi yang lebih besar karena air terperangkap di dalam tanggul, dan tidak mengalir ke laut. \u201cJika kita bisa merestorasi teluk dan air yang terpolusi, maka ini akan berdampak baik bagi peradaban di Indonesia. Saya yakin ekonomi baru akan muncul dari situ \u2013dalam bentuk pariwisata, budidaya perairan, maupun industri perikanan.\u201d Muslim Muin, kepala riset teknik pantai di Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), juga tidak terkesan pada proposal bernilai milyaran dolar itu. \u201cJika Tanggul Raksasa diwujudkan, akan ada biaya luar biasa besar untuk pembangunanan dan pengoperasiannya dan ini akan menciptakan dampak lingkungan yang serius dan memakan biaya tinggi. Lebih parahnya, proyek ini bisa memperparah risiko banjir Jakarta.\u201d \u201cDengan membangun waduk-waduk, sirkulasi air akan menurun secara pesat dan sampai pada titik air tidak lagi bergerak. Proses pembersihan alami tidak lagi terjadi,\u201d tambahnya sambil menyebutkan epidemi malaria yang dimulai dari isu air pada zaman Belanda.     Sebuah tanggul laut sedang dalam pengerjaan di Muara Baru. Foto: Kemal Jufri untuk the Guardian    Coenen juga mengakui bahaya lingkungan dari \u201claguna air kotor\u201d yang mungkin tercipta dengan pembangunan tanggul di teluk Jakarta. Tapi dia berpendapat bahwa pembangunan tanggul harus diikuti dengan usaha sanitasi air. \u201cYang menjadi poin utama adalah dalam waktu dekat kita tidak akan punya pilihan lain,\u201d tambahnya. Namun ini bukan sekadar kontroversi lingkungan. Rencana Tanggul Raksasa telah terkait dengan gagasan yang lebih ambisius dan mengundang perdebatan, yaitu rencana sapu bersih daerah tepian laut. Pindahnya daerah pemukiman ke selatan pesisir telah dimulai di zaman penjajahan Belanda di abad ke-19. Penduduk yang lebih memilih tinggal di daerah hijau dan jauh dari penyakit serta banjir memilih untuk menetap di bagian selatan kota. Tren ini terus belanjut bahkan setelah Indonesia merdeka di tahun 1945, dan kebanyakan penduduk kota tinggal di Selatan, Timur atau Barat Jakarta.  Akibatnya, daerah pesisir pantai didominasi oleh pelabuhan dan industri-industri terkait dan menjadi rumah bagi para nelayan miskin. Yang menjadi perkecualian adalah komunitas Indonesia keturunan Cina yang berperan penting dalam dunia bisnis di negara ini, termasuk dalam bidang properti.    Gugatan-gugatan ini melihatkan keterikatan antara para pengembang dan APBD Jakarta    Etnis Cina sudah lama menetap di daerah teluk Jakarta dan banyak dari keluarga-keluarga kaya dan berpengaruh di kota ini menempati komunitas berpagar dan kompleks apartemen bertema laut dengan nama seperti Regatta dan Green City. Pembicaraan mengenai kota tepi pantai baru yang terdiri dari 17 pulau buatan, mencuat sejauh tiga kilometer dari pesisir pantai menuju teluk, telah dimulai sejak pertengahan tahun 1990-an. Proyek ini sempat terhenti karena krisis ekonomi Asia, namun kini kembali dimunculkan dengan gagasan tambahan \u2013 pulau-pulau tersebut bisa menjadi sumber penghasilan untuk menambah dana bagi proyek NCICD di negara yang pemerintahnya selalu kekurangan dana. Kapal-kapal keruk berukuran besar telah didatangkan ke teluk untuk menuangkan muatannya dan membentuk fondasi bagi pembangunan empat pulau di tahun 2013, namun pembangunan itu dihentikan di April lalu. Penangguhan proyek diumumkan ketika terungkap kasus korupsi menyangkut salah satu pimpinan kelompok pengembang yang menyuap anggota pemerintah terkait hukum zona di daerah itu. Pihak penuntut membongkar hubungan finansial yang mencurigakan antara pengembang dan bagian anggaran kota Jakarta. Pemerintah menyatakan bahwa proyek reklamasi akan dimulai lagi di bulan September, namun hingga kini proyek tersebut belum berjalan. Akibatnya, pembangunan keempat pulau tersebut menjadi proyek terbengkalai dan terlarang.     Pulau-pulau: Gedung-gedung tinggi, hunian berpenjagaan ketat dan pelabuhan kapal pesiar    Pulau-pulau: Gedung-gedung tinggi, hunian berpenjagaan ketat dan pelabuhan kapal pesiar Pengunjung yang memasuki oasis berpendingin Riverwalk Bay, mal di dasar kompleks Green City di daerah Pluit, dapat melihat contoh \u201cPulau G\u201d hasil rancangan NCICD yang dipasarkan sebagai Pluit City. Maket itu terlihat begitu mewah dan futuristis dengan gedung-gedung tinggi modern, komunitas vila berpagar, dan marina bagi kapal-kapal pesiar. Seorang petugas keamanan mengawasi area itu untuk memastikan setiap pengunjung mematuhi aturan \u201cdilarang memotret\u201d. Agar dapat melihat Pulau G dari dekat, penting untuk berlayar ke teluk Jakarta bersama Suhali bin Urip, nelayan setempat, yang telah bekerja di daerah itu selama 30 tahun. Suhali, 58 tahun \u2013 wajahnya terlihat lebih tua dari usianya karena selama puluhan tahun ia melaut di bawah terik matahari tropis \u2013 merupakan salah satu aktivis kampanye \u201ctolak reklamasi\u201d. \u201cKami adalah penduduk yang tinggal dan bekerja di sini, tapi tidak ada seorang pun yang mendatangi kami untuk mendiskusikan masa depan kami,\u201d ujarnya. \u201cKelompok elit, para politikus, orang-orang kaya, mereka membuat keputusan tanpa memedulikan kami atau pun mencoba memahami kami.\u201d     Ari Sapilah seorang nelayan di Muara Angke. Foto: Kemal Jufri untuk the Guardian    Suhali tinggal bersama keluarganya di desa nelayan di Muara Angke. Penduduk desa itu berpenghasilan sekitar 25 hingga 40 dolar AS setiap bulannya bekerja di atas perahu dan kini mereka dipaksa berlayar lebih jauh untuk menangkap ikan. Gubuk-gubuk reyot dari papan tripleks, batako dan lembaran seng yang disatukan dengan tali atau paku berdiri di atas panggung kayu dan menghadap ke lautan yang berfungsi sebagai toilet serta tempat sampah.  Perahu kayu Suhali, dengan cat yang mengelupas dan dek yang merenggang, ditambatkan di dermaga yang terbuat oleh batang-batang bambu dan kerangka-kerangka pintu yang sudah usang. Beberapa kali ia menarik tali untuk menghidupkan mesin kapal. Setelah mesin terbatuk-batuk dan menyala, kami berlayar di teluk Jakarta mengarah ke tempat tujuan. Pergerakan perahu kami diawasi oleh petugas polisi di perahu motor.    Sekarang mereka membangun tanah ini di perairan kami sehingga tidak ada ikan yang tersisa untuk ditangkap di sini  Suhali     Tidak lama kemudian Pluit City yang masih dibangun terlihat di depan mata. Saat ini pulau-pulau itu masih berupa gundukan pasir reklamasi setinggi beberapa kaki di atas permukaan air dengan pengembangan Regatta dan Green City sebagai latar di kejauhan. \u201cSaya dulu biasa mencari ikan di sini,\u201d ujar Suhali, perahunya bergoyang-goyang mengikuti ombak. \u201cTapi mereka kini membangun daratan di atas air sehingga tidak ada lagi ikan di sini.\u201d Selama perjalanan, kami hanya melihat satu nelayan menebarkan jalanya \u2013berharap menemukan ikan di daerah itu. Satu-satunya perahu lain yang beroperasi adalah perahu dayung pencari sampah yang mengumpulkan botol-botol plastik untuk dijual dan didaur ulang. Dalam perkara hukum yang menolak rencana reklamasi pulau, Lembaga Bantuan Hukum Jakarta telah menyatakan bahwa pulau-pulau baru ini menempati wilayah tradisional nelayan mencari ikan. Sedangkan sedimen dari proses pengurukan telah mengusir ikan dari perairan setempat.      Sebuah papan reklame yang menawarkan kota pinggir laut.

Para pengembang di daerah pesisir pantai hampir semuanya merupakan kelompok Cina Indonesia seperti juga Basuki, gubernur yang biasa bicara blak-blakan. Sedangkan komunitas lokal di daerah itu yang terancam tergusur sebagian besar adalah penduduk setempat yang beragama Islam. Di samping itu, wilayah pengembangan baru yang mencakup pulau-pulau buatan tidak hanya dipasarkan bagi penduduk kelas atas Indonesia, melainkan juga pembeli keturunan Cina dari Singapura, Malaysia, Hong Kong dan Cina daratan via iklan-iklan televisi dalam bahasa Mandarin yang menjual \u201cvisi gaya hidup baru\u201d di Pluit City.     Penggusuran: seperti adegan kehancuran sisa peperangan Photograph: Kemal Jufri for the Guardian    Penggusuran: seperti adegan kehancuran sisa peperangan Ketika pertikaian yang akan menentukan masa depan daerah pesisir Jakarta tengah berjalan, gubernur Jakarta sudah mulai melancarkan aksi kontroversialnya untuk memecahkan persoalan banjir di bagian tengah kota. Sungai-sungai kota sudah lama penuh dengan sampah dan manusia. Puluhan ribu orang mendirikan pemukiman di sepanjang sisi sungai, mereka bahkan menancapkan tonggak-tonggak kayu di atas sungai dan membangun rumah di atasnya. Kampung-kampung tidak resmi ini berkembang menjadi pemukiman miskin tempat masyarakat tinggal dan bekerja. Sebagian pemukim menggunakan sungai sebagai tempat sampah dan pembuangan kotoran sehingga memunculkan bau tidak sedap dan menyumbat aliran sungai serta kanal yang mengakibatkan banjir kronis di dalam kota. Tidak hanya itu, pemukiman dan pabrik-pabrik yang memadati tepi sungai juga menyebabkan lebar sungai menyempit dan aliran sungai semakin terhambat. Tentu saja, ada banyak penduduk Jakarta yang ikut berkontribusi dalam isu polusi ini, namun mereka yang tinggal di kampung-kampung miskin inilah yang menjadi sasaran resmi.

Tapi dengan gaya administrasi Basuki yang \u201csegera bereskan\u201d dalam melihat tata kota, dia juga melakukan pengusiran massal pada penduduk kampung di sepanjang sungai. Menurut petugas, lokasi pemukiman di tepi sungai meningkatkan permasalahan banjir, dan mereka yang bermukim di sana rentan menjadi korban banjir. Basuki mengikuti nasihat dari para konsultan untuk melebarkan sungai dan mendirikan tanggul sehingga air yang meluap dapat segera mengalir ke laut atau disimpan dengan aman. Di berbagai tempat di Jakarta, tembok-tembok beton didirikan di sepanjang bantaran sungai dengan menggunakan peralatan berat.

Kecurigaan bahwa mereka dipaksa pindah untuk mendirikan proyek pariwisata di wilayah dekat gedung-gedung Belanda beratap merah yang merupakan peninggalan zaman kolonial dan bukan untuk memperlancar aliran air sungai serta memerangi banjir merebak dengan cepat. Para petugas telah memberitahu para pengungsi agar pindah ke rumah susun berbiaya rendah yang telah dibangun di bagian lain kota. Namun rumah baru yang ditawarkan oleh pemerintah terletak 20 km jauhnya dari kediaman mereka, di lokasi yang menempatkan mereka jauh dari air tempat mereka bekerja di usaha perikanan dan pariwisata.

Leader to laggard summarises the history of the UK\u2019s rail network. In 1825 the UK led the world with the opening of the first passenger railway between Stockton and Darlington. But by 1964, when Japan introduced its first bullet train, with speeds of up to 200mph,  5,000 miles of the nationalised UK railways were being closed in the Beeching cuts.  Other nations are now racing ahead of the UK.  By 2020, in time for the 2020Expo  the journey time between Dubai and Abu Dhabi \u2013 a distance of nearly 100 miles \u2013 could be cut to 12 minutes with the train running at speeds of up to 760 miles an hour.  China has 12,000 miles of high-speed railways and is discussing with India the building of high-speed lines up to 1,400 miles long.  Switzerland\u2019s 35-mile rail tunnel under the Alps to Italy opened in June this year.  Meanwhile, in the UK, the planned electrification of the railway between London and Bristol has been cancelled, which will have a big impact on the number of jobs en route and in Bristol and a knock on effect in south Wales.  Good transport creates jobs and wealth.  It also creates national cohesion. Would Scotland feel so distant from Westminster and other parts of the UK if there were high-speed links? Would the north-south divide be so evident had communications been better? The chancellor\u2019s announcements in the autumn statement are welcome. However, they are a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed to compensate for 100 years of relative neglect and to compete with other countries.  The billions being spent on Brexit is resulting in a massive wasted opportunity to transform the UK economy and public services.

This may not be unprecedented on tour but it might be unnecessary. Ben Duckett, Gary Ballance and Zafar Ansari, to use the ill-chosen yet candid assessment of Ashley\u00a0Giles when talking about Steven Finn during England\u2019s one-day campaign in Australia in January 2014, are currently \u201cunselectable\u201d. With Stuart Broad injured, England are picking from 13 for the Test in Mohali.   Related: Jos Buttler named in England side for third Test as Ben Duckett misses out    There is no disgrace in this for the unfortunate trio, but such redundancy could become a more regular occurrence as overseas tours increasingly comprise only Test matches without any games in between for players to recover touch and confidence. Alastair Cook, who takes the wellbeing of the younger members of his tour party very seriously, was sympathetic to the plight of Duckett, the latest batsman to be dropped. Unwittingly, when explaining the inclusion of Jos Buttler at Duckett\u2019s expense, he may also have identified one of the flaws of the squad selected. \u201cThere\u2019s a better mix of right- and left-hands now, though if people are playing well it makes no difference at all,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere\u2019s been many a top order with six out of seven right-handers and if they play well no one mentions it all.\u201d Responding to the idea that the squad could be augmented or changed in Mumbai, England\u2019s next port of call, he said: \u201cYour suggestion is a valid one \u2026 but they [the possible replacements] could be sitting at home with their coats and wellies on so to come out here doesn\u2019t make sense either.\u201d Here Cook expresses the traditional argument for keeping the original squad together come what may. It is hard to go from coats and wellies straight into the blazing sun, although Colin Cowdrey, a week before his 42nd birthday, found the challenge irresistible in the winter of 1974-75, which saw the awesome union of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson come to pass. But four decades on the world has shrunk as rapidly as the coffers of the body running the English game have expanded. Now the England and Wales Cricket Board spends hundreds of thousands of pounds each year on the \u201cinternational pathway\u201d. This winter more than 50 players, identified as possible future internationals, are being sent around the globe. Usually most of them end up in Dubai for a training camp and a few fixtures under the eye of Andy Flower, which is the case this winter. So what is to stop a shuffling of personnel between Dubai and Mumbai? Could Duckett be spared traipsing around India, mulling over his past few dismissals at the hands of Ravi Ashwin and go off to the United Arab Emirates, where he might be able to remind himself that he can bat and demonstrate to others why he might be retained in England\u2019s one-day squad while someone such as Tom Westley could be shipped to Mumbai?   Related: England know they must tame Virat Kohli to have chance of levelling series | Vic Marks    Mostly this does not happen because of a lack of precedent. It is commonplace to send for a replacement when an original party member is injured but not when someone has become \u201cunselectable\u201d because of a complete loss of confidence. In fact there have been a few precedents in recent times and they usually involve Ian Salisbury and Finn. On the 1992-93 tour of India, Salisbury was a late addition to the touring party essentially as a net bowler and to gain experience. Then in Kolkata, to general consternation, the brains trust picked him in the first Test team in preference to John Emburey and Phil Tufnell \u2013 a plan that did not work frightfully well. By the same token Salisbury was removed from the England touring squad for Sri Lanka in 2001, having performed poorly in Pakistan beforehand, to be replaced by Robert Croft. As for Finn he may have been unselectable in 2014 in Australia, but in March 2010 he was added late to the squad in Bangladesh and he immediately leapfrogged an original selection, Liam Plunkett, making his Test debut in Chittagong \u2013 in Cook\u2019s first match as England captain. My guess is that Duckett \u2013 and maybe one or two others in this squad \u2013 would not mind being replaced, or reshuffled, provided there is no reduction in their pay, of course. They might even welcome the escape but there is no indication that this mildly revolutionary move is about to take place. In the future the Lions squad might be strategically placed every winter to make this possible. Instead Duckett remains and he can only take solace in the words of his captain. \u201cBen won\u2019t be the only good player who has ever got dropped,\u201d said Cook on the eve of the Mohali Test, \u201cand he has an England future. He said he thought he was a pretty decent player of spin [no doubt that is the case when batting in aggressive vein for Northamptonshire in Division Two] and he is. But he just has an issue, which has unfortunately been found out quite quickly [against quality off-spinners attacking his leg stump]. He can go and address that and come again because he\u2019s a very talented and exciting cricketer in all three forms.\u201d But is India, with its constant reminders of his recent traumas, the best place for Duckett to do that over the next three and a half weeks?", "title": "England\u2019s \u2018unselectables\u2019 may be best off leaving India tour treadmill | Vic Marks", "sentences": ["Usually most of them end up in Dubai for a training camp and a few fixtures under the eye of Andy Flower, which is the case this winter.", "So what is to stop a shuffling of personnel between Dubai and Mumbai?"], "publicationDate": "2016-11-25T13:28:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/26/tiger-woods-golf-spoty-fa-cup-", "tags": ["Sport", "Golf", "Tiger Woods", "Rugby union", "Cricket", "Football", "FA Cup", "UK Sport"], "article": "TIGER RETURNS After one false start, cautious optimism best be the watchword in anticipating Tiger Woods making his comeback to competitive golf.

According to reports, Cellino first toyed with sacking Garry Monk two games into this season. Then again after four games. But then Monk\u2019s side started performing, hitting form in time for Tuesday\u2019s glamour tie, and reviving memories of their most recent golden era. How long ago was that? It\u2019s 15 years since they reached the Champions League semis. Three years later they were relegated in financial chaos. And it\u2019s been seven years since they last faced Liverpool \u2013 also in the League Cup. How did that one go? The League One side charged into it in on the back of 15 home league wins on the trot \u2013 but lost 1-0 at Elland Road. David N\u2019Gog scored Liverpool\u2019s second-half winner. So what are their chances this time? Never discount the magic of the Rumbelows, or the impact of squad rotation \u2013 but it looks like it\u2019ll be tough under the lights at Anfield. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some mighty battles with Liverpool over the years,\u201d says former star Eddie Gray. \u201cI just wish it was at Elland Road.\u201d Any omens? One big one \u2013 and it has nothing to do with the number 17. Almost exactly 19 years ago David O\u2019Leary\u2019s Leeds were 1-0 down at Anfield with 10 minutes left. Then 18-year-old debutant Alan Smith came off the bench to equalise with his first touch, before Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored twice to win it 3-1. Something similar on Tuesday should tick Cellino\u2019s boxes.

Her father is coaxing her to overcome her fear and jump from a dressing table. It is the only way she will learn to be strong, he tells her. So Sozzani jumps. That jump is real, but it\u2019s also a metaphor, and it comes conveniently early in Franca: Chaos and Creation, a new documentary in which Sozzani\u2019s son and only child, Francesco Carrozzini, attempts to unravel the origins of his mother\u2019s fierce independence and her soaring magazine career as the long-time editor of Vogue Italia.    In London in the 1960s everybody was different \u2013 that was beautiful    That he doesn\u2019t entirely solve the conundrum is no impediment to enjoying the film. Sozzani is a thoughtful, sometimes stubborn, sometimes droll subject who broke with Italian convention by annulling her first marriage after three months and running off to see the world \u2013 first to India, and then London in the late 1960s when it felt like the centre of the universe. Later still she would hitch around the US, with an itch to get out into the world that served as a catalyst for her magazine career. \u201cIn London you really smelled the freedom, it changed my way of thinking completely,\u201d Sozzani recalled during a recent visit to New York. We were sitting at the back of the Bowery Hotel, and the sun glinted off the mane of golden hair that rolls over her shoulders and down her back (she says she is terrified of ageing, but appears to be managing it exceptionally well). Late 1960s London left a singular imprint on Sozzani. \u201cIn London everybody was different \u2013 that was beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody wanted to look alike. In a way this kind of freedom gives you even more creativity.\u201d     Blonde ambition: Franca Sozzani and Francesco Carrozzini at a fashion show in 1994.    As she talks, Sozzani\u2019s son, and the director of this curate\u2019s egg of a documentary, offers small murmurs of assent or dissent depending on the subject. At other times he is absorbed by his mobile phone. Although he was spurred to make the movie by the death of his father, who he barely knew, Franca: Chaos and Creation belongs wholly to Carrozzini\u2019s mother and her relentless drive to succeed. \u201cI always thought my life was predetermined to be a normal life \u2013 house, children, golf,\u201d Sozzani says in the movie. \u201cAnd then I decided that this was not the life I wanted to have. I couldn\u2019t stay home with the kids and make spaghetti.\u201d The fact that she is recounting this to her only child is part of the movie\u2019s central conflict. Carrozzini grew up in a single-parent household in which the single parent was frequently away. Even as he insists that she\u2019s a terrible cook, you get the feeling he would have liked the odd bowl of spaghetti.    I decided that this was not the life I wanted to have. I couldn\u2019t stay home with the kids and make spaghetti    Many people are driven to succeed, but for a mother to prioritise career over family in 1970s Italy was an anomaly that marked out Carrozzini from his schoolfriends. Several decades later, in 1992, Hillary Clinton would deploy similar language to defend herself as First Lady-in-waiting (\u201cI suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfil my profession\u201d), and the fact that we\u2019re still arguing about whether and how mothers can find a work-life balance is a big part of what makes Sozzani so refreshing. For her, work is life. In the documentary we see mother and son watching old home movies. \u201cYou never took me to the park like other kids,\u201d Carrozzini says, more curious than accusing. \u201cI never took you to the park, period,\u201d she replies. \u201cNot even with a stroller. I even missed your school\u2019s elementary graduation because I got back home the day after.\u201d If there is regret, it registers as barely more than a flicker. Where Carrozzini is frequently sentimental, Sozzani is decidedly not. \u201cShe\u2019s very much about the future, and I\u2019m a huge nostalgic,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is literally the thing that differentiates us the most.\u201d It\u2019s also, perhaps, the animating principle behind Sozzani\u2019s editorial instincts. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think of the past, but it\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck in the past, beholden to it, then your creativity is stuck there, too, because you don\u2019t give yourself a chance to evolve.\u201d     Shock tactics: an image from Steven Meisel\u2019s 70-page Makeover Madness story. Photograph: Steven Meisel    It\u2019s been just over 50 years since Vogue Italia was first published, and Franca Sozzani has been the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief for more than half that time. She arrived in 1988, the year \u2013 the same month in fact \u2013 that Anna Wintour became editor-in-chief of American Vogue. Since then, each woman has spawned a cult following, while pursuing very different paths. You could say that Wintour\u2019s Vogue is the magazine no fashion house can afford to ignore, while Sozzani\u2019s is the magazine that no fashion house wants to ignore. One is insistently commercial, the other ceaselessly creative. There are 21 international editions of Vogue, and most cleave more or less to the formula that Wintour has established. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can say anyone else has more power than Anna,\u201d says Sozzani. \u201cShe represents America, and she represents the biggest power you can have as an editor. At the same time my choice was about creativity, so we really made separate choices but with total respect for each other.\u201d The two women are now friends, but Sozzani says it took some years to get to that point. \u201cWe are both very determined and relentless,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a great sense of family in terms of our children \u2013 and she\u2019s British, so she also has a sense of humour.\u201d     \u2018We have a great sense of family in terms of our children\u2019: Francesco Carrozzini as a baby.    As a rule, Sozzani says, she gets on better with men. \u201cI like things to be clear, and with men that\u2019s usually easier. The women I\u2019m closer to, like Anna, are women who are very straight.\u201d She feels the same way about Donatella Versace. \u201cShe always fights, and she pays for her mistakes, but she\u2019s willing to take risks. Gianni [Versace] was the opposite in many ways, very temperamental. One day he could say something and after five minutes change his mind completely. Donatella is very reliable, and much more focused.\u201d Every magazine editor knows you cannot please all the people all the time, but few have appeared quite as sanguine as Sozzani about pissing off so many people so much of the time. If she sees a fire, her instinct is to run to it. War, violence, terrorism, drug abuse, environmental catastrophe \u2013 all are grist for Sozzani\u2019s fashion mill, an oil-and- water mix that frequently gets her into trouble.    Cond\u00e9 Nast believed they were hiring a businesswoman with a plan, but she\u2019s crazy!  Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy     Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, admits she initially pushed the magazine too far out of the company\u2019s comfort zone. \u201cI said if you keep going in this direction, I might have to fire you.\u201d Sozzani persuaded him to give the transition time even as the magazine\u2019s older advertisers fell away. Meanwhile, she was granting photographers greater and greater latitude to do as they pleased. At one point in the film the philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy pops up, randomly, to say that Cond\u00e9 Nast believed they were hiring a businesswoman with a plan, before adding with a smirk, \u201cBut she\u2019s crazy!\u201d     \u2018If you keep going in this direction, I might have to fire you\u2019: Cond\u00e9 Nast chairman Jonathan Newhouse with Franca Sozzani, Naomi Campbell and Donatella Versace in Dubai, 2013. Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images    What Cond\u00e9 Nast wanted, says Sozzani, was \u201cgirls jumping, laughing\u201d. What they ended up with was stories like Steven Meisel\u2019s 70-page \u201cMakeover Madness\u201d, a riff on cosmetic surgery that featured models in various \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d poses, and some in mid-operation. There are bloody bandages, liposuction tubes, syringes and scalpels. It\u2019s as if the screenwriters of Ab Fab had managed to insert Patsy and Edina into the acme of fashion, illuminating the artifice of the beauty industry in one fell swoop. For a woman who grew up anticipating a life of bourgeois boredom, it\u2019s telling that Sozzani has no compunction in skewering the world she escaped. \u201cSome of the people I know very well told me: \u2018I thought this was disgusting, this issue, with all this blood, it has no respect for women,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that point of view. Women decide to have plastic surgery, and it\u2019s a choice. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s an imposition from somebody else.\u201d     In deep water: from Steven Meisel\u2019s Water &amp; Oil story. Photograph: Steven Meisel    Another Meisel story, this time from 2010, conjured a Deepwater Horizon-style oil spill, and featured models as mermaids washed up in slicks of oil. The story was eviscerated on social media, a factor Sozzani never had to consider when she started, but every attack on her taste or sensitivity appears to leave her unmoved. \u201cI\u2019m very stubborn when I have ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen pursuing them I prefer to make my own mistakes, and not because they tell me it\u2019s wrong.\u201d Her instincts have sometimes let her down \u2013 a graphic fashion story highlighting domestic abuse, again shot by Meisel, served to trivialise the issues. \u201cIn Italy, every three days a woman dies, killed by a relative, husband, boyfriend,\u201d says Sozzani. \u201cProbably the fact I credited the clothes was a bit too much. At the same time, to make a statement I have to use the tools I have. My tool is a fashion magazine.\u201d She recalls being told at journalism school that photographs must serve the text, an axiom she has since turned upside down, not least because Italian speakers, by and large, are limited to Italy. Language is no barrier for a photo story. Of course the stories that flirt with the news are only part of the formula she has developed. To pore over a fashion editorial like Tim Walker\u2019s whimsical contributions to the magazine is to lose yourself in a bedtime story that is one part  PL Travers to two parts Kenneth Grahame, in which you might stumble on a wrought iron bed suspended from an oak tree, or find yourself looking into a stately home overrun by horses. Often it seems the clothes are there to propel the story more than the story is there to sell the clothes.     The more fantastical the better: Franca Sozzani looks over a new issue of Vogue Italia.    For Sozzani the more fantastical a fashion story the better. She worries that the relentless focus on commerce \u2013 collections being sold as they are being sent down the runway \u2013 is diluting fashion\u2019s potency. \u201cPeople want to dream,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to take a journey, a trip in their imagination, and that\u2019s not simply about buying a dress.\u201d At the same time, she thinks that luxury fashion is designed for young women but only affordable for the middle-aged. \u201cSo you see women of 55, 60, nude \u2013 wearing a transparent dress as if that\u2019s normal,\u201d she scoffs. Neither is she impressed by ready-to-wear lines that have made fashion generic across the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of conformity, it\u2019s the antithesis of fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cCreativity is about doing anything you want \u2013 in London in the 60s nobody wanted to look alike, but today everyone does.\u201d The same might be said of fashion magazines, or at least the mass-circulation titles, and it\u2019s the fact that Vogue Italia is not interested in conforming that separates it from its competition. For the photographer Paolo Roversi, Italian Vogue is a self-portrait of Sozzani. \u201cIt reflects her,\u201d he says in the documentary. \u201cShe takes what she needs from each photographer to build this self-portrait.\u201d    I don\u2019t know how you had all this success, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that smart  Francesco Carrozzini     Because of their relationship, the conversations between mother and son in the movie can be feisty, but also honest. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you had all this success,\u201d Carrozzini tells Sozzani at one point, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that smart.\u201d She laughs off his impudence, but later the two wrestle with the movie\u2019s most palpable absence. Carrozzini wants to know about his father, a man he barely got to know before he died five years ago. It\u2019s during a routine taxi ride, the backdrop for many of the interviews, that Sozzani tells him matter-of-factly that his father was married to another woman when he was born. \u201cI can\u2019t even remember her name,\u201d she says. \u201cAh well,\u201d replies Carrozzini. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to learn new things.\u201d They never return to the subject. \u201cHe was not a bad person, he was just messy,\u201d says Sozzani later as we say our goodbyes at the Bowery Hotel. Does she want to share her life with anyone else? She considers the question, and then says, \u201cI never compromise, and in any kind of relationship you have to compromise.\u201d Perhaps that is why she is so successful in the world of magazines, where compromise is a hindrance. What does she think is the single greatest asset she brings to her work? \u201cI add the dream,\u201d she cries, the light glancing off her arresting blue eyes.

And I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively.\u201d The billionaire real estate tycoon and president-elect has made a career out of building inexpensive walls and filling them with very expensive apartments. But this would be a wall of a different kind: an \u201cimpenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern border wall\u201d that would march along the Mexican border, to keep out the \u201cdrugs, crime and rapists\u201d, punctuated with one \u201cbig, beautiful door\u201d \u2013 presumably so his Trump Tower taco bowls could still come in. Like most of Trump\u2019s policies, the wall has always been big on bluster but light on detail. It mysteriously grew in height as his campaign snowballed, from 30 to 55ft, while budgets rose from $8bn to $12bn. Independent assessments suggest it would cost more like $25bn and require more than three times as much concrete as the Hoover Dam. Unperturbed, Trump insisted his wall would have \u201cbeautiful everything\u201d and be \u201cjust perfect\u201d. \u201cMaybe someday they\u2019ll call it the Trump Wall. So I have to make sure it\u2019s beautiful, right?\u201d Since winning the election he has conceded that, in places, it might actually be a fence.     Tall storeys \u2026 Trump Tower apartments start on \u2018floor 30\u2019 despite there being just 19 floors below them. Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/ Getty    If it\u2019s anything like the other edifices that bear his name, in 20ft high bronze letters, beauty might be stretching it. From the serrated flanks of his brooding Trump Tower to the gold lam\u00e9 attire of his Las Vegas hotel, his buildings glow with a surface sheen, like his own bronzed face, but it is a veneer of luxury that masks a prosaic product underneath.  As the former New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp put it, Trump\u2019s towers \u201cdon\u2019t quite register as architecture\u201d but instead stand as \u201csigns of money, status, power\u201d like the \u201cdiamonds, furs, yachts and other tokens of the deluxe life enjoyed in Marbella\u201d. What Muschamp found objectionable about Trump\u2019s taste was not the \u201cdesire for attention, for the best, the most, the tallest, the most eye-catching\u201d but \u201chis failure to realise these desires creatively in the architectural medium\u201d. For the king of superlatives, nothing has ever turned out quite as \u201ctremendous\u201d as he promised.    His projects are often characterised by bold claims that don't stand up \u2013 like their height    His first Manhattan project, completed in 1980, set the tone, taking the ailing Commodore hotel, a handsome brick and limestone building from 1919, and entombing it inside a shell of mirrored glass. It spawned the Trump style of wrapping standard buildings in paper-thin party costumes of chrome, bronze or gold depending on the occasion, and adorning them with sparkly signifiers of glitz and glamour. Just like his policies, Trump\u2019s real estate projects are often characterised by bold claims that don\u2019t quite stand up \u2013 beginning with their height. He famously inflates the floor numbers of his buildings: the \u201c90-storey\u201d Trump World has 72 floors, while apartments in Trump Tower begin at \u201cfloor 30\u201d, despite there being just 19 commercial storeys below them. \u201cPeople are very happy,\u201d he has said, openly proud of his marketing ruse. \u201cThey like to have apartments that have height, the psychology of it.\u201d The Trump Tower in Chicago was planned to be the tallest building in the world when it was announced in 2001, but it was hurriedly scaled back following the 9/11 attacks \u2013 despite Trump\u2019s rhetoric of not being cowed by terrorists. It now stands like a stunted Mini-Me version of Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa (designed by the same architect), at less than half the height of its Arabian cousin.  Lacking the desired height, Trump tried to make up for it with the size of his sign, which spells out his name in back-lit stainless steel letters running the length of half an American football field across the 16th floor. Mayor Rahm Emanuel slammed the sign as \u201ctasteless\u201d and set about changing the city\u2019s regulations to prevent a repeat of such vulgarity. As ever, Trump hurried to Twitter to defend his creation: \u201cBefore I bought the site, the Sun Times had the biggest, ugliest sign Chicago has ever seen,\u201d he thundered. \u201cMine is magnificent and popular.\u201d     Taken down \u2026 a billboard in Dubai, where Trump is building a golf course in the desert. Photograph: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty    But the popularity of the Trump brand \u2013 a byword for \u201cSuperior Quality, Detail and Perfection\u201d according to his website \u2013 has suffered hammer blows as a result of his vitriolic presidential campaign. In Dubai, where he is building a golf course in the desert, a large billboard featuring the man himself swinging a club was taken down following the announcement of his plan to ban Muslims from entering the US, while sales of his home decor range were also suspended.  In Istanbul, where the conjoined tilting shafts of the Trump Towers loom 150 metres above the city, President Erdo\u011fan has declared that \u201cthe ones who put that brand on their building should immediately remove it\u201d. Even before his comments, the $300m scheme had not provided the premium that investors were promised.     Prices slashed \u2026 the Trump Ocean Club, Panama City. Photograph: Rodrigo Arangua/AFP/Getty Images    Similar stories of inflated expectations, followed by legal wrangling, are repeated across the globe. The Trump Ocean Club in Panama was plagued by delays. By the time the yonic edifice was completed in 2011, there was a glut of high-end apartments, so prices were slashed and many buyers walked away. The condo owners\u2019 association is trying to sack Trump\u2019s management company, claiming it exceeded budgets and used its fees to cover hotel costs. Trump, in turn, is now seeking $75m in damages. The Trump Tower hotel in Toronto \u2013 topped with a strange quiff like the man himself \u2013 also opened late to find the market flooded with five-star hotels. It has been subject to a lawsuit by buyers who say they were misled by marketing materials, while the local developer is also trying to remove Trump\u2019s name from the project.

Photograph: Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket/ Getty    The story is repeated in New York, where Trump unusually settled a lawsuit brought by buyers of his $450m Trump SoHo development. They asserted that they had been defrauded by exaggerated claims. He admitted no wrongdoing however. According to the New York Times earlier this year, a separate lawsuit stated that the project was \u201cdeveloped with the undisclosed involvement of convicted felons and financing from questionable sources in Russia and Kazakhstan\u201d.  Elsewhere, plans for further Trump towers, from Rio to Azerbaijan, have hit the buffers, while recent records show his controversial golf courses in Scotland have made losses of almost \u00a326m. In sum, it all suggests that Trump might not be quite the star deal-maker he claims to be. So what is it like to be on the wrong side of his famous deals?     Architect Andrew Tesoro. Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images    Architect Andrew Tesoro had first-hand experience of being on the receiving end of the Trump Organisation\u2019s deal-making machine when he was commissioned to design the Trump National golf club in New York state, a process that left him on the verge of bankruptcy. Driven by Trump\u2019s infectious enthusiasm, the project quickly tripled in size \u2013 along with the associated workload \u2013 but the additional fees were not forthcoming.  By the time the building was completed, Tesoro had amassed unpaid invoices to the tune of $140,000. After endless requests and meetings with his associates, he finally got a face-to-face meeting with Trump, which proved to be a textbook lesson in Trump\u2019s trademark cocktail of charm and ruthlessness. \u201cHe told me that we built the most spectacular clubhouse in the world,\u201d Tesoro recalls. \u201cI was the finest architect he\u2019d ever met, he was going to make this project the best-known building of its type in the world, the next project was going to give me the opportunity to recoup any money that I\u2019d lost \u2013 and, just because I\u2019m such a nice guy, he was going to offer me $25,000 to go away.\u201d     The Trump National golf club in New York state. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters    At first Tesoro declined, so he was handed over to Trump\u2019s attorney. \u201cThe attorney told me quite directly that, if I sued, I would probably get all the money I was owed, but that it was his job to make it take so long, and cost me so much, that it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\u201d It raises questions over how Trump plans to administer his $500bn infrastructure plan, a scheme that has already got the construction industry salivating at the thought of the tax-credit-driven contracts. \u201cWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d Trump declared in his victory speech. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.\u201d         Tesoro featured in this Clinton campaign video    The American Institute of Architects was quick to pledge its unwavering support to the new administration, writing that its 89,000 members \u201cstand ready to work\u201d with Trump on his grand building plan.

As architect and critic Michael Sorkin writes in an open letter: \u201cTrump\u2019s well-documented history of racial discrimination, tenant harassment, stiffing creditors, evasive bankruptcies, predilection for projects of low social value \u2013 such as casinos \u2013 and his calculated evasion of the taxes that might support our common realm are of a piece with his larger nativist, sexist, and racist political project.\u201d He concludes: \u201cWe call upon the AIA to stand up for something beyond a place at the table where Trump\u2019s cannibal feast will be served.

A Guardian investigation found a wide variety of popular goods being illegally sold without VAT on Britain\u2019s leading shopping sites. They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables. In some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices. Mostly, however, their prices remain in line with law-abiding competitors and the proceeds of evasion disappear overseas, often to China.   Related: Black Friday online frenzy as John Lewis sales beat expectations    Guardian investigations found many tax-evading sellers were trading without displaying VAT numbers on Amazon or eBay. Others were showing made up numbers, or numbers cloned, without authorisation, from unsuspecting legitimate businesses. Several sellers purported to be operating through UK trading companies, but checks showed these firms had been dissolved, sometimes years earlier. None responded to questions about VAT. HMRC estimates the explosion in VAT fraud on Britain\u2019s shopping websites will cost \u00a31bn to \u00a31.5bn in lost VAT revenues this year, with much of it going missing in the current festive period. By the end of \u201cCyber Monday\u201d. UK shoppers will have spent \u00a36.77bn on the web in a seven-day shopping binge that peaked on Black Friday, according to online retail association IMRG. The number of parcels ordered online will be up 12% on last year, it estimates. The market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers. On eBay, for example, 40% of UK sales of Android phones are to firms registered in China. Meanwhile, Chinese-based companies account for more than 60% of sales of Christmas tree fairy lights on eBay.co.uk. There is no suggestion that Amazon or eBay have themselves evaded tax, but critics claim they could make some basic changes \u2013 such as requiring sellers to display valid VAT numbers \u2013 that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial-scale fraud. Both eBay and Amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers. VAT rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the UK even if the seller company is incorporated overseas. Shoppers typically see prices that include VAT, charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20%. Amazon told the Guardian: \u201cMarketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations.\u201d It added that Amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs\u201d.     EBay said it \u2018continually reminds\u2019 sellers of their need to comply with the law. Photograph: eBay/PA    EBay said it would pass information from the Guardian\u2019s investigation to HMRC: \u201cIf we are informed by HMRC that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action.\u201d A spokesperson said eBay \u201ccontinually reminds\u201d sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the UK government\u2019s efforts to deal with VAT fraud. After the Guardian first highlighted rife VAT evasion on online shopping sites, HMRC launched a series of warehouse raids, seizing \u00a3500,000 of goods. Months later, the then chancellor George Osborne gave tax inspectors new powers which he said demonstrated \u201cfirm action to protect the UK market from unfair online competition [from overseas VAT evaders]\u201d. Under the new rules, HMRC now has the power to issue Amazon and eBay with warning notices about suspected VAT fraudsters using their sites. If they then fail to take action, Amazon and eBay can be held liable for any VAT that later goes missing.  In reality, however, these changes have had little impact and VAT evasion remains widespread. A spokesperson for VATfraud.org, a campaign group set up by UK-based sellers, said: \u201cDespite the new laws, HMRC have shown a woeful lack of action. There are many fraudsters who were reported to HMRC years ago but are still trading, and evading VAT, today.\u201d Guardian investigations found Amazon even offering extensive support services at its British warehouses to overseas sellers that were doing little to mask their VAT evasion. As well as advertising these sellers\u2019 goods on Amazon.co.uk, it holds items in Amazon UK warehouses, arranges delivery to addresses across Britain, and deals with complaints and returned goods. Amazon warehouse staff even offer gift-wrapping services on behalf of the fraudster sellers. There is no suggestion Amazon or eBay knowingly facilitate specific fraudulent VAT-free sales, but the two US groups are nevertheless well aware that evasion in online shopping is a major problem. Meanwhile, the sellers themselves are often based overseas, with little or nothing known about their UK sales activities by HMRC.     Checkout windows for an iPad Air 2 from the Apple Store (left) and an Amazon seller    One such seller, a company based in Dubai, offered an iPad Air 2 for sale on Amazon.co.uk. The iPad was sold at \u00a3456.68, which was a similar price to that on offer at Apple\u2019s own online store. However, the Apple store price included a \u00a378.17 VAT charge while the Dubai-based Amazon seller charged no VAT at all. Asked for a VAT receipt, the iPad seller said in an email: \u201cWe don\u2019t supply UK VAT receipt, sorry.\u201d Many sellers contacted by the Guardian were similarly open about not charging VAT. \u201cThank you for your letter and sorry to tell you we do not have UK VAT receipt.

As the right-hander was repelling India\u2019s bowlers for just shy of three hours from No8 with an unbeaten 59 on the fourth day of the match \u2013 one that ended with Alastair Cook\u2019s going 2-0 down in the series with two Tests to play \u2013 the results of an overnight scan were returned to the medical staff. They showed the blow inflicted by the fast bowler Umesh Yadav on the first morning had broken his little finger in two. Hameed requires a metal plate in the digit and will be replaced by a batsman from outside the squad for the fourth Test in Mumbai from 8 December with the openers Nick Gubbins and Keaton Jennings, and the middle-order batsman Sam Billings, who are in Dubai with the Lions, among the candidates.   Related: India beat England by eight wickets in third Test to take 2-0 lead in series    Trevor Bayliss said after the defeat, in which India knocked off 104 to win in 20.2 overs after England\u2019s 236 all out, that Hameed had pleaded with him to remain on tour to finish the series. While that request was denied, the England coach spoke in glowing terms of the Lancashire opener for both the way he batted, with only two paracetamol tablets numbing the pain, and the skill in changing his technique to make sure his little finger did not remain on the bat handle. \u201cHe has obviously got a high pain threshold,\u201d said Bayliss, who claimed the origin of the break may have been a similar blow suffered during the second Test. \u201cIf you\u2019d have seen him in the changing room though, you wouldn\u2019t have thought there was anything wrong. It\u2019s a great sign and the sort of attitude you want. He wants to stay and play the last two Tests. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and even his old man said: \u2018Just tape it up, he\u2019ll be all right.\u2019 \u201c[While England were fielding on the third day] he went over to net three times and the first two times weren\u2019t too successful. He was working out a way with his little finger off the bat and once he did, he was quite comfortable. It\u2019s a hell of a skill to have, to change the way you play to combat that. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of other guys who have got hit and make a big song and dance about it. I think there\u2019s a lot of guys in the team in awe of what he\u2019s been through. The lack of showing any pain and the guts and determination is a good sign. We\u2019ll make sure he gets back and gets it done so he\u2019s right to go early next season.\u201d Cook, who will have another new opening partner in Mumbai, described Hameed\u2019s rearguard as a \u201cvery special knock\u201d and one that deserves the respect of the team. His opposite number, Virat Kolhi, was Hameed\u2019s hero growing up as a young cricketer at home in Bolton and went out of his way to shake the teenager\u2019s hand at the end of the innings in a Test that otherwise featured plenty of animosity between the sides. \u201cI wish him a speedy recovery,\u201d said Kolhi, the only batsman on either side to face more deliveries than Hameed\u2019s 640 during the series. \u201cHe put his hand up when his team wanted him to do it. You can sense it as a captain, this guy is intelligent. I think he\u2019s a great prospect for England and he\u2019s definitely going to be a star in all forms if he keeps persisting with his skill. That\u2019s why I patted him on the back: it was an innings of character and something you need to applaud.\u201d Hameed\u2019s breakthrough tour, one that saw him selected following a county summer that brought 1,189 County Championship runs, was not isolated to the 156 balls of defiance during England\u2019s second innings in Mohali, with his average of 43.8 inking him in to resume his Test career against South Africa in July. Beyond the numbers was the temperament shown batting at the highest level, displaying diligent judgment of line and length as well as different gears depending on the situation.   Related: India beat England by eight wickets: third Test, day four \u2013 as it happened    In Rajkot this manifested itself with 82 in the second innings which saw him strike the spinner Ravi Jadeja for six in a situation in which the pressure could easily have got to other debutants. In the second Test in Visakhapatnam his second innings rearguard of 25 over 144 balls was ended only by a shooting delivery from Ravi Ashwin into the base of his pads that trapped him lbw. In Mohali he marshalled the tail to at least give England\u2019s attack something to bowl at. Having waited for 110 balls before striking his first boundary, the pick of the shots came when the seamer Mohammed Shami was hooked behind square off the front foot. The six mown off Ashwin to bring up his half-century saw him become England\u2019s first teenager to score two half-centuries in Test cricket and with it his international future, once the small matter of having a metal plate put in his finger, looks incredibly bright.", "title": "England\u2019s Haseeb Hameed confirms star quality with show of steel and style", "sentences": ["Hameed requires a metal plate in the digit and will be replaced by a batsman from outside the squad for the fourth Test in Mumbai from 8 December with the openers Nick Gubbins and Keaton Jennings, and the middle-order batsman Sam Billings, who are in Dubai with the Lions, among the candidates."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-29T10:32:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/30/which-players-have-scored-hat-tricks-on-their-international-debuts", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "\u201cI see Serge Gnabry scored a hat-trick on his international debut,\u201d observes Neil Harrington. \u201cJust wondering how many other players have achieved this feat, or even exceeded it?

Denis Hurley points to Arthur Brown, \u201cwho won three caps for England between 18 February and 13 March 1882.

And here\u2019s Kevin Dennehy: \u201cDieter M\u00fcller scored a hat-trick for West Germany on his international debut against Yugoslavia on 17 June 1976. Where it gets interesting is that it was the European Championship semi-finals and he came on as a sub in the 79th minute, scoring in the 82nd, 115th, and 119th minutes.\u201d Tys Hallema can go one better: \u201cIn the Netherlands there have been two players who scored four on their international debut. Eddy de Neve scored four in the first international match Holland ever played, against Belgium in 1905 which ended 4-1. Also, Faas Wilkes scored four on his debut in 1946 against Luxembourg.\u201d Geoffrey van Haarlem was another reader to point in De Neve\u2019s direction, but adds: \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave out this detail: the Belgian goal was an own goal by Ben Stom (whose last name in the Dutch language genuinely translates as \u2018stupid\u2019). However, when it comes to hat-tricks in the regular 90 minutes we have the story of Piet de Boer. At the age of 18, De Boer made his debut on 28 November 1937 against Luxembourg and scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 victory. Despite this achievement it turned out to be his first and last appearance for the national team, making him the player with the highest scoring average in Dutch national team history.\u201d Which reminds us of other prolific international scorers.

I should add that it was not technically Weber\u2019s international debut, as he had already played three friendlies with his native Croatia. Weber\u2019s rushed naturalisation in 1994 was controversial and didn\u2019t sit too well with the other Red Devils. Despite him being league top scorer for three seasons running, he was largely shunned by his team-mates during the World Cup in the United States. Weber nevertheless forced a move from lowly Cercle Brugge to Anderlecht, but his career petered out when he injured his knee.\u201d Bringing it to club level, an excited Gary Fairclough writes in: \u201cFinally! One that I can answer without even looking at Wikipedia having been in attendance of the event. Midfielder Brendan O\u2019Connell was not particularly known for his goalscoring prowess. On his debut for his final professional club, Wigan Athletic, O\u2019Connell enjoyed a dream debut, netting a hat-trick in the 5-2 opening-day win over Wycombe. This feat was made all the more impressive given that Wigan had a penalty when O\u2019Connell was on a hat-trick but this was taken (and missed) instead by Scott Green, rather than giving O\u2019Connell the chance to complete his treble. Thankfully, inept Wycombe defending in the closing stages allowed him to complete the feat regardless. O\u2019Connell\u2019s three goals that day would turn out, if memory serves me well, to be more than half of the goals he would score in a Wigan shirt.

Related: Keaton Jennings stunned by \u2018whirlwind\u2019 England call-up for India tour    India\u2019s confidence is soaring ever higher after they recovered so emphatically from a tricky 204 for six in their first innings. They bat deep and they bowl dry. Now the likelihood of England squaring the series is not much greater than Sir Ian Botham voting \u201cremain\u201d in any second referendum. The summons of another batsman, Keaton Jennings, is justified but also a confirmation that the squad has been carrying a few passengers. When the postmortems begin in earnest at Lord\u2019s after Christmas there will surely be an item on the agenda entitled \u201cselection\u201d. Strategically there were mistakes in September with the elevation of too many unproven or out-of-form left-handers. Moreover there was an element of wishful thinking in the choice of the Surrey spinners, albeit when contemplating a very shallow pool. That has been maintained with the call-up of Hampshire\u2019s Liam Dawson as a replacement for Zafar Ansari. The ECB release notes Dawson played white-ball cricket for England last summer \u201cafter impressing on last winter\u2019s Lions programme in the UAE\u201d. There is a school of thought, albeit a bit old-fashioned, that an even better way to impress is by excelling in real first-class matches. Dawson took 20 wickets for Hampshire, who were briefly relegated last summer, at an average of 43.85. He is not the next best available spinner in the country but he did average 33.89 with the bat. They have selected another batsman who can bowl a bit. Let us hope that when Jennings, who at least had a prolific season for Durham even if he does not have a reputation of being particularly adept against spin, arrives someone is at hand to point him out to Trevor Bayliss since first impressions are important in any relationship. Bayliss\u2019s knowledge of England\u2019s cricketers extends only to those he has been sent by the selectors over the last 15 months. The team\u2019s coach cannot have a significant input in the selection of new players in the squad \u2013 for the simple reason that he has never seen them play nor does he have a trusted network to consult within English domestic cricket. This may be an unavoidable problem but, to use a phrase that has been trotted out all too frequently on this tour, \u201cit is not ideal\u201d.   Related: England heading for Dubai R&amp;R and hoping to refresh for final two Tests    Even without the poor selections and the self-confessed misreading of the pitches in India, England would probably have found themselves two down with two to play. There are holes in this team. The depth and quality of the spin bowling remains a problem despite the progress of Adil Rashid. Moreover the constant lament has been the inability to score enough first-innings runs on benign batting surfaces; the No4 slot remains a problem and now there is the renewed uncertainty about Alastair Cook\u2019s latest opening partner. Bayliss insists it is important that batsmen should remain positive in outlook, eager to rotate the strike and to take the attack to the Indian spinners whenever possible. This makes absolute sense, but one handy little hint after the Mohali Test \u2013 as many as eight English players fell in the first over of a new spell in that game. Batsmen should seek to impose themselves on a new bowler but not necessarily in that first over. Perhaps there should also be concern about a man who is having an excellent tour. In this series Ben Stokes has hit a century and he has a five wicket-haul; he is England\u2019s most charismatic cricketer, with Hameed coming up on the rails. He has become a leader in the dressing room and the most likely topic of conversation at any press conference. Bayliss seldom waxes lyrical when confronted with a microphone but he comes alive when talking about Stokes \u2013 the pair of them obviously hit it off \u2013 just as he did when bidding farewell to Hameed after the Test match.     Ben Stokes has enjoyed a strong tour, with 128 in the first Test and a five-wicket haul in the third. Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters    So where is the problem with this fast-maturing cricketer, albeit one who is occasionally overcome by the red mist? It is not one of Stokes\u2019s making but too often in this series he has been compelled to bat like Graham Thorpe and to bowl like Angus Fraser. Stokes has, in fact, worked hard with Thorpe, one of the ECB\u2019s batting gurus, and the welcome consequence is that he has a much sounder defence against spin bowling and is more adept at manipulating the ball into the gaps. But at the moment Stokes always seems to find himself having to play that way. He is constantly trying to shore up a situation that is out of control. Ideally he should be the wildcard who can take the attack to the opposition. At the moment the batsmen above him do not allow him to set free those aggressive instincts \u2013 they get out too quickly. There may even be a danger that Stokes will soon forget how to launch those assaults that can change a game in a session. To an extent the same applies to his bowling. He has been Cook\u2019s most potent paceman in this series. But increasingly he has had to undertake the role of stock rather than shock bowler. His captain needs him to restore order and to pound out a few maidens with the bloody-mindedness of Fraser two decades ago. In the long term this may not be the best use of his talents. In a good England team he should seldom be shackled.", "title": "Call-ups for Keaton Jennings and Liam Dawson highlight England\u2019s misreadings | Vic Marks", "sentences": ["Related: England heading for Dubai R&amp;R and hoping to refresh for final two Tests    Even without the poor selections and the self-confessed misreading of the pitches in India, England would probably have found themselves two down with two to play."], "publicationDate": "2016-11-30T14:17:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/30/st-helens-keiron-cunningham-england-rugby-league-training-camp-dubai-wayne-bennett", "tags": ["St Helens", "England rugby league team", "Rugby league", "Sport"], "article": "The St Helens coach, Keiron Cunningham, has labelled Wayne Bennett\u2019s plans to take the England squad to a training camp in Dubai as \u201cabysmal\u201d as Saints faces the prospect of losing several key players for a significant part of pre-season training.

Related: Horse racing tips: Friday 2 December    The 15-minute video, which was shown to an audience of 30 apprentices at the British Racing School on Thursday and can also be watched on YouTube, encourages any jockeys who are struggling with addiction to seek help. It also includes an interview with Tony McCoy, the 20-times National Hunt champion jockey and a lifelong teetotaller, and quotes from the autobiography of the former Flat champion jockey Richard Hughes about his own struggle with alcohol. Murtagh, who retired after the 2013 Flat season to concentrate on his new career as a trainer, rode as the principal jockey for Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Ballydoyle Stable and the Aga Khan\u2019s powerful bloodstock operation during his long and successful career. However, Murtagh says in the film that for the first 10 years of his career in the saddle as a leading jockey, and even after a six-week stay at a clinic specialising in addiction problems at the age of 21, he struggled to control his drinking. \u201cFor 10 years I never got one year sober,\u201d he says. \u201cI might get nine months, I might get 11 months, I might get six months but I was never sober.

Before that I might be brilliant for one day but I wasn\u2019t consistent as a person and in my job.\u201d Murtagh also adds that strict alcohol and drug-testing regimes mean jockeys are now much more likely to be caught if they are regularly drinking or using drugs. \u201cI get some young jockeys calling me and they know they\u2019re drinking too much and I say: \u2018Would you like to go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThat word puts them off straightaway, they\u2019re too young.

Fast forward 18 months, with England 2-0 down to India, looking worryingly ill-equipped to square the series and a year away from their defence of the Ashes in Australia, the question of when this button will be pushed is starting to cross minds, not least since Cook, who will turn 32 on Christmas Day, began openly talking of a desire to return to the playing ranks before his eventual retirement.   Related: Andrew Strauss says Alastair Cook not finished yet as England Test captain    Is the current team, one that beat Australia in 2015 and then won in South Africa but now sit two defeats away from equalling a record eight losses in a calendar year (matching 1984, 1986 and 1993), still progressing under Cook? It is something Cook and Strauss continue to discuss on a series-by-series basis. With a home Test summer against a resurgent South Africa and a perhaps less-threatening West Indies side, any change to the arrangement would logically need to occur after either the current tour or the 2017-18 Ashes, given Root would need a run-up to tackling such a winter. Australia is a tour that Cook himself may well eye as a swansong in the role given the 5-0 defeat suffered last time. He would likely have a side better equipped, you would think, to compete there than on the subcontinent, too. His captaincy, after an England-record 57 Tests, continues to attract criticism for \u201cconservatism\u201d \u2013 the third day in Mohali the most recent example \u2013 but with holes in the batting and only one spinner, Adil Rashid, fulfilling their role, not all of it should fall at his door. Root, speaking before he and the majority of the squad flew to Dubai for a mid-tour rest before the fourth Test in Mumbai on 8 December, has unsurprisingly stated his preference for Cook to carry on for some time. \u201cI think he is pretty set on captaining for a few years and I hope he does because I think he is a brilliant leader and I\u2019ve really enjoyed playing under him,\u201d said the 25-year-old, who has only known life under Cook since making his debut in 2012. \u201cI\u2019m quite happy with the role I\u2019m playing at the moment and you want to do what is right for England and the side. \u201cAnd genuinely, honestly, I think he is the right man. Hopefully, we get these results we want in the last two games and we can put right what has been quite a frustrating last couple of weeks.\u201d Cook stated after the defeat in Mohali that the team\u2019s mini-break is certainly needed amid their epic seven-Test pre-Christmas schedule and while a six-month hiatus will follow in the new year, this is understandable on a personal level with the five days in Dubai seeing him reunited with his family and the daughter with whom he has spent only the 18 hours after her birth before flying out to join the team in Bangladesh. Root has been unaware of this having had any effect on his leadership, however, with blame for the current dormie scoreline in his eyes resting squarely on the jumbled batting lineup that, after racking up 537 first-up in the draw in Rajkot, failed to pass 300 in their first innings during the defeats in Visakhapatnam and Mohali. \u201cI think he is coping all right,\u201d said Root. \u201cHe\u2019s very professional and you don\u2019t really get much from him in that respect. I imagine it must be quite tough being away from a new child and family and everything. You could put a lot of blame on Cooky but actually it is the responsibility of the batters to make those big scores. You can blame whoever you want, but we have to take responsibility for our own games.\u201d Root was certainly one of the guilty men during both, having run out his partner Haseeb Hameed and been caught in the deep during the second-day collapse in Vizag, and the swipe across the line against Jayant Yadav \u2013 the first ball after drinks on the opening morning \u2013 saw him trapped lbw for 15 and England falter again in Mohali. Greater disgust with himself would come in the second innings, however, when on 78 he was caught at slip off the left-armer Ravi Jadeja to end a stand of 45 with the injured Hameed at No8 that he felt may have given England a puncher\u2019s chance of bowling out India had it continued. Hameed, who has returned home this week for surgery on his broken little finger and will be replaced by Durham\u2019s uncapped left-hander Keaton Jennings (who celebrated his England call-up with an unbeaten century as Lions captain in their eight-wicket win over United Arab Emirates in Dubai), has made an impression on Root, who in his role as a senior player has spoken to the 19-year-old on how best to approach his cricket for Lancashire before the South Africa series in July. \u201cThe only advice I gave was make sure you don\u2019t go back to county cricket at the start of the summer and rest on your laurels and think: \u2018I\u2019m a Test cricketer now,\u2019\u201d Root said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to prove to everyone in county cricket that you are there for a reason. You have opportunities to make some really big scores, keep learning and improving, put the good work he has done here into his game and continue to develop the way he has done. \u201cHe will have different expectations in the future and that might be a different challenge but he has got a very good head on his shoulders and he should be proud of what he has done so far. Now it is about managing those expectations and being realistic \u2013 it\u2019s going to take time to keep developing and it might not always go how he wants. But I\u2019m sure that if he does have some hard times, he\u2019ll get through it.\u201d Sound advice from the second best batsman in the world Test rankings. India\u2019s Virat Kolhi jumped into a career high third after Mohali, having begun the series in 15th, and with Australia\u2019s Steve Smith top and New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson fourth it means Root is the only one among this recognised elitewho is not captain of his national side.

Are you at the Wolseley?\u201d And of course I always am, so she\u2019ll join me and I\u2019ll buy her a glass of champagne and a slice of battenberg. Even when my ex-husband, who lives in Dubai, comes to town, he\u2019ll just say, \u201cCan you book?\u201d The word Wolseley doesn\u2019t pass his lips, because he knows that\u2019s where it\u2019ll be.

Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    I was 18 when I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. My dad brought home a leaflet about it, and I think he expected me to go off on one. But I went to the doctor and had the tests done, and a week later the results came back that I had mild Asperger\u2019s. My grandad introduced me to the Company Inn around the same time. I don\u2019t normally like going to pubs and clubs and parties. I\u2019ve got highly sensitive hearing, so I like this pub because it isn\u2019t too loud and I can relax there. Once I get used to something, it stops being overwhelming. I come here three times a week for lunch and always order the quarter-pounder with cheese and bacon, and a pint of Guinness. My grandad used to get the fish and chips and a pint of ale. He passed away earlier this year, but I know he\u2019d be happy that I\u2019m still coming here.    Once you\u2019ve tried something and you know you like it, why would you go anywhere else?    I\u2019m a big Notts County supporter, as is my younger brother Adam, and we always go down to the Company on a Saturday together before football. He\u2019s 24 and he\u2019s got his own family and works full-time; that\u2019s the one time we know we\u2019ll always see each other. I\u2019ll sometimes bring mates from uni, but I\u2019m really happy just to come and sit on my own. I like routine and order. I will sometimes go to new places, but once you\u2019ve tried something and you know you like it, why would you go anywhere else? I see my diagnosis as a blessing. I was bullied at school, and it\u2019s helped me to understand who I am. Being told I\u2019m on the spectrum has only made me more determined. I\u2019m doing a master\u2019s degree in journalism, I have loads of friends and I volunteer with an autism charity. Just because you\u2019ve got this label, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do whatever you want in life.   Ahmad Al-Masri, 31, is a radiopharmacist.

Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    I\u2019m originally from Damascus, but I\u2019ve been living in London for almost a decade. My grandfathers were active in their opposition to the Ba\u2019ath party, and we were forced to leave. Although I\u2019ve lived in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the US, wherever we were, my parents created a Syrian bubble around us.    As soon as I stepped in, it was like being back home. The smell of orange blossom water, the dialect    I discovered Diwan Damas about four years ago. As soon as I stepped in, it was like being back home. The smell of orange blossom water, the heaviness of the ghee in the air, the Damascene dialect, familiar-looking faces: it was almost overwhelming. Even the way the desserts are laid out is very specific to Damascus. It\u2019s hard to explain why, but you wouldn\u2019t have seen them like that in Aleppo. I started chatting to the guys who own the place, because I spotted a dessert called madlou\u2019a, which literally means \u201cspilled\u201d. It\u2019s semolina on the bottom with raw cream spilled over it. I\u2019ve never seen it anywhere but Damascus. I used to make it with my mother when I was a child. It\u2019s very simple and has a subtle flavour, so it really shows the artistry of the person who makes it. I buy some every time I come here. Some days I\u2019ll pop in and get something small like a milk pudding or, if it\u2019s a hot day, bouzza, which is Syrian ice-cream. It\u2019s very thick, because they beat all the air out of the cream and then sprinkle it with pistachios. I\u2019ll always buy a lot of sweets if I\u2019m going to a friend\u2019s house for dinner. I think it\u2019s an act of love, saying to another person, \u201cHey, this is a thing that I like, this is where I\u2019m from.\u201d With the situation at the moment, I think it\u2019s very important to show people there\u2019s another side to Syria. The last time I was there was in 2011, for my mother\u2019s funeral. I always say I lost my country and my mother at the same time. It\u2019s probably no coincidence that I discovered this place around the time of the crisis. You start to feel that need for something, without even realising what it is, and then you start searching for it, and I found it here. It\u2019s unfathomable to me that I won\u2019t go back to Syria one day. As soon as I\u2019m able to, I want to get back to help and build in some way. But, until then, I\u2019ll get my tiny taste of Damascus here. Eva Braithwaite, 23, is a restaurant manager. She goes to Shears Yard, Leeds, at least three times a week     Eva Braithwaite at Shears Yard Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    I first came here when it opened in 2013, and it seemed like just my kind of place: informal and independent. I work in a busy restaurant and live on my own, so I come here after my shift ends to wind down. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to go home to an empty flat, but I don\u2019t want to feel obliged to socialise with people, either. It\u2019s like a buffer zone between the intensity of work and the calm of home. I like having the hum of people around me while I read my book or write, or just sit and think.    I\u2019ll usually have a glass of merlot and a cheeseboard. When they see me come in, they start pouring the wine    I\u2019ll usually have a glass of merlot and a cheeseboard, and sit at the bar. I don\u2019t need to order it: when they see me come in, they start pouring the wine. Other times, I\u2019ll pop in for an espresso and just have a few minutes to myself before the working day starts. I\u2019ll also sit down for a full meal; they change the menu every few months so it doesn\u2019t get boring. I\u2019ve become really good friends with Simon, the bar manager, and he\u2019s constantly coming up with new cocktails and getting me to test them. He\u2019s promised to name one after me. I grew up in London and came to Leeds for university, and it started to feel like home. I love how diverse, progressive and creative the city is. But it can sometimes feel lonely. I\u2019m single, and a lot of my friends have office jobs, so their hours are different from mine. Sometimes I\u2019ll spend a bit too much time by myself or on Facebook, and I have days when I feel I\u2019m just staring at my phone, then I know I need to be around people again. But there\u2019s a big difference between loneliness and solitude. I have a big circle of friends, and my job means I\u2019m constantly in contact with the public, so I like my own company sometimes. I look for places where it doesn\u2019t feel inappropriate to be alone, and this is one of them. Samantha Earl, 38, is a full-time mother. She goes to the Larder in Wanstead, Essex, every day     Samantha Earl at the Larder. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    Daphne was born in January 2015 and we were in hospital for a week. I remember on the third day of being back home with her, I went to the Larder for a coffee. I bumped into an old colleague and she said, \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re out and about already. I was on my sofa for weeks.\u201d But almost straight away, I had cabin fever, and going to the Larder was a way of feeling a bit like my old self. From that point on, I started going every day, often three times a day. I\u2019m quite Gina Ford in my parenting, and I got into a routine really early with Daphne. She\u2019d go to sleep only when I was pushing her in a buggy, so every morning at 8am, I\u2019d push her up to the Larder, she\u2019d fall asleep and I\u2019d sit in the window and have a decaf soya mocha. I started getting it in a takeaway cup, so that if she started crying I could run out and push her, and that habit has stuck.    I must have spent thousands of pounds in there. Sometimes I\u2019ll have lunch, too, and I\u2019ll always order the same thing    After that morning coffee, I\u2019d take her home, change her, feed her, then she\u2019d be ready for another nap, so I\u2019d push her back up to the Larder. In the evenings, when my husband got home, we\u2019d go back to the Larder because I felt like I\u2019d been in the house all day. I must have spent thousands of pounds in there. Sometimes I\u2019ll have lunch, too, and I\u2019ll always order the same thing: the toasted wrap with pesto and goat\u2019s cheese. I always sit at the same table by the window, so I can look out and see people. If someone sits at my table, I feel annoyed. I feel like part of the community when I come here. They get a lot of regulars, so I see the same people every day, and they stop and ask how I\u2019m doing. In the early days, it was really encouraging seeing other mums with older kids, and they\u2019d say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this phase doesn\u2019t last for ever.\u201d Having a new baby can be really lonely and boring, so just grabbing 10 minutes for a coffee became therapeutic. Sometimes, on the weekends, we go to another cafe up the road, because they open slightly earlier. But the coffee\u2019s just not as good. I always feel like I\u2019m cheating.

Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    I didn\u2019t even know what a carvery was until three years ago, when my mum mentioned it to me. I love a roast dinner, but the meat takes for ever to cook and I can\u2019t be arsed with all the washing-up, so a carvery sounded spot on. I Googled it and this was the nearest. I always come here with my boyfriend, Jordan. We\u2019ve been together six years, and we\u2019re living with my mum while we save up to buy a place: going to the Carvery is a way of getting some time for ourselves. We go at least three times a week, and I always get the roast. I haven\u2019t tried anything else. Jordan sometimes tries to be healthy, so he\u2019ll just get a soup.    Where we live, people are not accepting, so we\u2019d rather drive 25 minutes away, to feel welcome and safe    We don\u2019t smoke or drink or really go clubbing, so this is our treat. What I like about the Carvery is that it\u2019s a bit more upmarket than a takeaway, but not as expensive as some restaurants. It\u2019s like a country pub: it\u2019s got an open fire in the corner, and you see the same faces propping up the bar. We\u2019re really good friends with the waiters now. Jordan proposed to me in Dublin last summer, and he told one of the managers that he was going to do it before he told anyone else. When we came back, all the staff knew and were congratulating us. There are perks to being regular customers, too. When we come in, they\u2019ll have our drinks \u2013 Diet Cokes \u2013 on the table for us. If I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t feel that we could walk into any pub on the high street. Where we live, people are not accepting; there is no way we would hold hands on our street. We\u2019ve had homophobic abuse, and had to call the police. So we\u2019d rather drive 25 minutes away and feel welcome and safe. Coming here isn\u2019t just about the food.

I\u2019m a creature of habit.    I have to make a lot of creative decisions for my job, so I eliminate all the other choices from my life    I have to make a lot of creative decisions all day for my job, so I find that I work best if I eliminate all the other choices from my life: I take the same train every day; I work at the same desk in my co-working hub. My most productive days happen when I\u2019m in my routine. It helps me stay focused. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m boring; I\u2019m just saving my exciting stuff for other areas of my life. I remember reading an interview with the director David Lynch, where he said he went to Bob\u2019s Big Boy Diner in LA and had the same meal every day for seven years. He\u2019s from Missoula, Montana, and I used to live there, so I\u2019ve always felt an affinity with him. If David Lynch does it, maybe it\u2019s OK. I also wear the same thing every day: jeans, shirt and a black hoodie. There are other people who wear the same clothes, such as Mark Zuckerberg and I think Einstein, so I feel like I\u2019m in good company. I always go for lunch at 11.30am and a guy I work with refers to it as \u201cburrito time\u201d. I know the staff pretty well now, even though I don\u2019t know their names, and I\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t know mine. Sometimes I\u2019ll see them elsewhere and say hello. One of my first jobs was in Starbucks and people would come through every day for years, getting the same drink, and we used to call them by their drink name. Years later, I saw one of my customers in England and I was like, \u201cNo way! There\u2019s double tall non-fat vanilla latte!\u201d I\u2019m sure the guys from Mission call me \u201cveggie burrito\u201d. I can\u2019t take offence at that.

Stokes moved closer to a possible suspension during the third Test defeat in Mohali when he was charged with using \u201clanguage or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting\u201d during an exchange with the India captain, Virat Kohli, after he was stumped for 29 during England\u2019s first innings. The official reprimand that followed was Stokes\u2019s second in a month after he was fined 15% of his match fee during the second Test in Dhaka for \u201cverbally engaging\u201d with the Bangladesh batsman Sabbir Rahman.

But sometimes a little bit of by-play between a couple of guys on either side who are passionate about their cricket and their team, I think it\u2019s good for the game. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to be careful we don\u2019t go overboard and completely cut that out. I think having some personalities in the game is fantastic to watch. Ben Stokes has got to learn to deal with it in a different way or get away with it a bit better. I think he\u2019s come a long way in the last 12 months or so and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll keep improving in that area.\u201d While the ICC can punish players off the field retrospectively, there are no provisions in the laws that provide a deterrent within the game itself. This may be about to change, with player behaviour one of a number of issues being discussed by the MCC world cricket committee in Mumbai next week, before the fourth Test. The committee, which will be chaired by the former England captain Mike Brearley, will consider a number of options to be written into the laws and applied at all levels, including the possible use of red and yellow cards, sin-bins or run-penalties to help umpires police the sport. With England 2-0 down to India going into the Mumbai Test, the form of Stokes in alien conditions represents a rare plus during what is proving to be a tough tour against the world\u2019s No1 Test side. His five for 73 in Mohali and the 128 made in Rajkot means he is only the sixth touring player to claim a five-wicket haul and score a century in a series here, a feat achieved by Ian Botham, in 1980 and 1981. \u201cThat\u2019s a feather in his cap,\u201d Bayliss said. \u201cSome of us are in awe of him. He just doesn\u2019t stop. He\u2019s like a wind-up clock. You get him off at the break, wind him up and send him back out.\u201d While the England management have remained in India, the bulk of the players are taking what they hope will be a restorative five-day break in the United Arab Emirates. Among them is Stuart Broad, who is taking time out of the trip to work with the medical team supporting the Lions side in Dubai as he tries to deal with the strained foot tendon that saw him miss the Mohali defeat. Broad will have further fitness tests before the fourth Test from 8 December, although Bayliss has admitted he is not 100% confident the 30-year-old will be ready in time. Watching on in Mumbai will be Haseeb Hameed, who has stated his intention to return to the tour after surgery in England on his broken little finger.

Recent history suggests they have a better chance of winning here than anywhere else in India since they have been victorious in their past two Tests at the Wankhede Stadium. In 2012, they won by 10 wickets after Kevin Pietersen had played one of the innings of the decade, 186 from 233 balls, during which he overwhelmed Ravi Ashwin on a turning track; meanwhile Alastair Cook hit 122, a knock that was merely excellent. In 2006, England won by 212 runs after Rahul Dravid had inserted Andrew Flintoff\u2019s side \u2013 Owais Shah made a fine Test debut and Shaun Udal polished off the second India innings with figures of four for 14. Oddly enough India have not played a Test here for three years, when West Indies were thrashed, but will be remembered more for Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s last appearance for his country. But we know what to expect. The Wankhede Stadium usually provides an interesting surface. On vibrant red soil the ball bounces more than elsewhere in India, which can offer some solace to quicker bowlers; but if the ball turns it does so more quickly than we have witnessed in Rajkot, Visakhapatnam or Mohali. It may be time for the agonising over the best balance of the England side to stop. In the first three Tests they decided to play three spinners alongside three pacemen. This was understandable; stare at the surfaces at the previous venues and they have looked drier than the wit of Jack Dee, yet one can now conclude, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. They hadn\u2019t a clue\u201d. This would be a harsh judgment since many onlookers, including this one, were seduced by the prospect of three spinners on such arid looking patches of turf. By their own admission this was a mistake by the team management \u2013 for two increasingly obvious reasons. England\u2019s third spinner has been of poor quality and how did we allow ourselves to forget that Indian batsmen tend to be so much better against spin than pace? Whatever the think-tank sees when they inspect the pitch on Tuesday, surely they will change the balance of the team. On Monday, Hampshire\u2019s Liam Dawson arrives in Mumbai from Bangladesh as a replacement for Zafar Ansari. He has been playing in the T20 tournament for the Rangpur Riders. From there Dawson had the good grace to echo the reaction of your correspondent to his call-up. \u201cI was very surprised. I didn\u2019t expect it all\u201d, he said before adding, \u201cbut it\u2019s a great opportunity and very exciting.\u201d Dawson is a plucky character, who will probably be an important member of the ODI squad after Christmas. He\u2019s a combative cricketer and a fine fielder, which impresses the head coach, Trevor Bayliss; he is, however, essentially a batsman who bowls. No doubt he would love to play in Mumbai \u2013 and clearly his attitude has impressed those in charge of the Lions \u2013 but he seems suitably realistic about what he can offer.   Related: Call-ups for Keaton Jennings and Liam Dawson highlight England\u2019s misreadings | Vic Marks    \u201cPeople see my season [in 2016] as only getting 22 wickets and say it is poor, but I did bowl well and I did give Hampshire control and that\u2019s something hopefully I can do if I play in the Test match. That\u2019s my job and that\u2019s been my job for the last three years at the Ageas Bowl.\u201d It would be a surprise if he does play and if he is selected it is more likely to be a consequence of his ability with the bat. However, expect the other newcomer, Keaton Jennings, to be catapulted into the team as the England captain\u2019s latest partner (even though we may have already discovered Cook\u2019s Catharine Parr \u2013 surely Haseeb Hameed will eventually survive him). Last season at Chester-le-Street Jennings, the son of Ray, who has been a ferociously competitive cricketer and coach in and outside of South Africa, will not have encountered many quality spin bowlers. His 1,548 Championship runs in 2016 at least hints at a meritocracy. Ashwin is likely to be introduced against this lanky left-hander within half a dozen overs.   Related: Keaton Jennings stunned by \u2018whirlwind\u2019 England call-up for India tour    Unsurprisingly, the young Jennings will arrive in a positive frame of mind \u2013 not just because of a century for the Lions against the United Arab Emirates in Dubai this week. There is quite an opportunity here. If he were to succeed on his debut, which would be a major achievement, then there are glittering prospects ahead. England might then consider playing three openers at the top of the order in July when they resume playing Test cricket with Cook, Hameed and Jennings and then Joe Root back at four; in which case the holes in the batting lineup are not so obvious. Ideally, the paceman to be added to the team would be Stuart Broad, who missed the last Test since it is not possible to bowl fast wearing a moon boot. It is tricky to gauge Broad\u2019s progress as he is currently several thousand miles away in Dubai along with the majority of the squad, though he has been receiving treatment from the England Lions medical staff. It would be a bonus if Broad is fit enough to play. The more likely outcome is that he will not be available, which would mean Steven Finn or Jake Ball might be drafted into the Test team. This would be quite an undertaking for both players. Finn last bowled at a batsman outside of a net in the Dhaka Test on 29 October, Ball delivered four overs in a practice match in Chittagong on 15 October.

It was Collision, aka 22-year-old graduate trainee Brett Collis, who took the \u00a31,000 prize in this new event in which pale young men sporting special goggles synched with flying cameras navigated an illuminated 3D obstacle course in the dark. FPV (first person view) drone racing is rapidly becoming a lucrative business: Sky Sports recently decided to show a US race series on its Mix channel and in March a 15-year-old British boy called Luke Bannister won $250,000 (\u00a3173,900) when he triumphed at the World Drone Prix in Dubai. Wearing his call sign on the back of his T-shirt, Collis explained how he graduated to drone racing from video games. \u201cIt\u2019s like a real-life computer game, with the extra dramatic dimension that if you crash you can\u2019t just reboot,\u201d he said, as a smattering of drone groupies pressed up against the barriers to eavesdrop on their hero. Poor old Saggy Nun, aka Oliver Peters, who occasionally competes in a wimple, barely got off the start line before hitting a barrier and wiping out. With even the cheapest Chinese drone costing \u00a3150, crashing can be an expensive mistake \u2013 not to mention a dangerous one. In November pilots reported four near misses in a month between drones and passenger aircraft, including one flying near the Shard in London and another at Liverpool airport. Self-described serial entrepreneur Alan Proto (\u201ca ghastly title, I know\u201d) was one of a fast-growing number of drone flying academies vying for business at the trade show, now in its second year. He set up Phantom Flight School in Chester two years ago after a career that began with a degree in economics from Cambridge and cycled through accountancy, construction, nurseries and skiing holidays. \u201cI bought my first drone at the start of 2015. I took it home, got it out of the box and thought, fantastic! Then, oh my God, I could kill somebody with this,\u201d he recalled. Since 2002 the CIA has been using Predator drones to kill insurgents in Afghanistan, but Proto wanted to fly in peace. Unable to find an instructor, he taught himself and now employs five pilots who have now taught for a combined 2,000 hours at \u00a3120 an hour. This year Phantom branched out into drone flying holidays in Spain. \u201cIt just struck me that flying drones can be quite a lonely pursuit. Standing in a field in England on your own is not as fun as standing in a field in Spain with five soon-to-be mates,\u201d he said. Prolo\u2019s customers \u2013 like 90% of visitors to the NEC on Sunday \u2013 are overwhelmingly male. \u201cI wish I knew why,\u201d he mused, \u201cbecause the few lady pilots I have trained have been very good and my five-year-old daughter is one of the best pilots I know.\u201d Carys Kaiser, who runs a blog called The Drone Lass, is one of the few female commercial drone pilots in the UK. Looking up at the all-male competitor list for the flying championships, she bemoaned the lack of women involved with the fast-evolving technology. \u201cWhy is it so blokey? Mainly because woman feel that it\u2019s not a career for them. You need to be a little bit technical and there\u2019s a shortage of women in Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths],\u201d she said. One of the most popular exhibits at the show was a synchronised flying display by eight dancing drones, fresh from an appearance on Britain\u2019s Got Talent and its French equivalent. The Parrot Bebop 2 (\u00a3599 including FPV goggles) is really designed as a flying camera for ambitious wedding or wildlife photographers but can be programmed with software to perform tricks in time to music. On another stall, the Drone Zone advertised itself as a \u201csafe place to fly your FPV\u201d on a purpose-built track in Popham, Hampshire.  Top Gun it\u2019s not.

Related: England selectors have some juggling to do before India ODI series    The England head coach, speaking on the day that the return of Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales to the one-day and Twenty20 squads was confirmed, has called for greater positivity from the Test batsmen \u2013 both in attack and defence \u2013 following the defeats in Visakhapatnam and Mohali. After a five-day break, in which the majority of the squad travelled to Dubai, training will resume at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday before the fourth Test starts on Thursday, with two new faces \u2013 the opener Keaton Jennings and the spin-bowling all-rounder Liam Dawson \u2013 among those jostling for places in the team. Bayliss, who is yet to watch Jennings bat in a match firsthand, is concerned that after the drawn first Test in Rajkot, where Alastair Cook\u2019s side racked up 537 in their first innings, his message of positive cricket has been replaced by confusion, leading to batsmen being in two minds and reaching sub-par totals. \u201cThe players are in a good space,\u201d Bayliss said. \u201cWe have been outplayed by the Indian team but when I look at where we are heading there have been enough good things happening in this series to suggest we are heading in the right\u00a0direction. \u201cThe first three innings of this series we had a nice positive approach to the game, in our mind and with our mental approach. If you look at batters who scored runs they were proactive, trying to be positive, which means they will defend well but when opportunities come along to attack we take them. \u201cProbably the last three innings we have got away from that a little bit. We have changed that mindset to more along the lines of survival, and when some of our naturally more positive players try to play that way they were in two minds. \u201cThe message to the guys in the last two Tests will be to approach it a bit more like we did in the first Test and maybe the first innings of the second Test when Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes got together [in a stand of 110].\u201d Asked whether these instructions will be delivered by him or his captain, he replied: \u201cIt will be up to me to play a role there. Probably over the last few series Cooky has taken on more of a role there, which has been great. But I think for the coming couple of Tests it is time I stepped up to the mark to just remind them of how we have played when we have played well.\u201d Bayliss was speaking at the team hotel on Monday when announcing England\u2019s squads for the limited-overs fixtures that take place after Christmas \u2013 starting in Pune on 15 January with the first of three one-day internationals before three Twenty20s \u2013 with Morgan and Hales back in after missing the tour of Bangladesh. Despite assurances of presidential-style safety measures for the October trip from Reg Dickason, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s security adviser, the pair declined to take part, having been assured there would be no recriminations by the national side\u2019s cricket director, Andrew\u00a0Strauss. Before the tour, which passed without incident, Morgan\u2019s stance was heavily scrutinised by two of the captain\u2019s predecessors. Nasser Hussain, writing in the Daily Mail, said that \u201cit has to undermine his authority\u201d while Michael Vaughan, in the Daily Telegraph, described it as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that would leave Morgan unable to look his players in the eye in future. Bayliss confirmed the matter of their return had not even been discussed by the selectors and he remains confident that Morgan\u2019s status among the squad will remain unaffected given the 30\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s role in reversing England\u2019s white\u2011ball fortunes since their dismal World Cup campaign in early 2015. \u201cI have not sensed that at all,\u201d Bayliss said. \u201cThere has been no comment about it. [Morgan] gets on well with all of the guys in the team. He is very highly respected among everyone for the job he has done over the last two years.\u201d A full-strength squad for the India series, with no players rested, means that, of the one-day touring party who won 2-1 in Bangladesh under the stand-in captaincy of Jos Buttler, the batsmen James Vince and Ben Duckett now miss out, with Sam Billings retained. While Hales will slot back in to open alongside Jason Roy following a year in which he has averaged 62 in one-day international cricket, with four centuries that included an English record 171 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in August, Morgan has found form more elusive in 2016 with just two half-centuries in 13 innings. Thus runs in India will be needed by the captain to prevent questions over his place in the team, not least since Duckett started his career promisingly with two half-centuries in what were his first three one-day games. Bayliss denied any suggestion that the left-hander\u2019s struggles against Ravi Ashwin during the Test series played a part. \u201cThe Duckett decision was the toughest one and the one we spoke about the most,\u201d said Bayliss, who confirmed that Morgan was consulted before the selection. \u201cHe has done well for himself but we thought we would show a bit of solidarity with the team we have had that have done so well in last 12-18 months. \u201cI have not had the chance to speak to him yet but my message to him will be: \u2018Mate, well done, you have had a fantastic start and see this as the beginnings of a career.

The UK will advise on more effective screening at airports in the region, with the aim of improving the tracking of potential terrorists.  On her first morning in Bahrain, the prime minister will speak to 900 British troops on board HMS Ocean in Khalifa bin Salman Port in Bahrain.

Three UK cybersecurity experts have been appointed to advise Gulf institutions and training on countering terrorist financing. Their first workshop will take place in Qatar next week. However, the commitment to helping Gulf nations strengthen their security apparatus and intelligence-gathering is likely to raise concerns from NGOs that any new surveillance capabilities would also be used to monitor pro-democracy activists and journalists. Labour and Lib Dem MPs called the trip \u201cthe shabby face of Brexit\u201d and said the prime minister must not let the desire for greater co-operation override concerns about crackdowns on journalists and protesters, as well as the conflict in Yemen.  Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: \u201cWe are deeply concerned that this security co-operation against terrorists may apply to human rights activists and critics to the regime. Bahrain labels human rights activists as terrorists and revokes their nationality.\u201d Fabian Hamilton, shadow Middle East minister, said: \u201cI am not convinced that concerns for human rights will be prioritised over a trade deal, given the government\u2019s obsession with having to show that the UK can cope on its own once it leaves the EU. I am concerned at the seeming complacency shown by Boris Johnson\u2019s comments on the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen on Sunday.\u201dTom Brake MP, Liberal Democrats\u2019 spokesman for foreign affairs, echoed the concerns. \u201cThe PM\u2019s desperate drive to boost UK exports must not come at the expense of the UK\u2019s commitment to upholding human rights around the world,\u201d he said. Turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia or Yemen will do long-term damage to the UK\u2019s international standing.\u201d May, who was greeted on her arrival in Bahrain on Monday night by King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, is said to be keen to deepen regional security ties, which Downing Street said had already saved British lives, pointing to the October 2010 \u201cprinter bomb\u201d scare at East Midlands airport on a flight bound for the US, which was caught by security forces after being picked up by Saudi intelligence. Speaking before her visit to HMS Ocean, the prime minister said the security of Gulf countries and the UK were intertwined. \u201cNow more than ever, Gulf security is our security,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about military power \u2013 we also need to work together to respond to new and diversifying threats.

He was presented to the press at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday after a training session in which he batted \u2013 and bowled \u2013 for a long\u00a0time. Currently England are more interested in his batting. The universal expectation is that Jennings will become Alastair Cook\u2019s new opening partner, though he did not fall into the trap of assuming that would be the case when he walked into the press room with a ready smile, an unmistakably South African accent despite his four seasons at Durham, and an easy, polite manner. Ideally Jennings will bring freshness and energy to the camp and, rather more importantly, much-needed runs at the top of the order. He will not have come across many world-class spinners while playing at Chester\u2011le\u2011Street in the past few years. But he is manifestly up for this challenge. His world has changed rapidly since the injury to Haseeb Hameed prompted his call-up from the Lions. \u201cIn the last 12 hours turning up with the guys in Dubai has been a little surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cMeeting the guys for the first time calms the nerves a little bit, especially for a guy like myself. I want to get along with my team-mates and try to drive that process. The last couple of hours have been really satisfying, to get to know the guys, play some football and break some ice.\u201d Ben Stokes, Jennings\u2019s Durham colleague, has aided that process. \u201cHe was on my football team in the morning and he got stuck into me. Stokesey has been brilliant at breaking the ice and as a team man he\u2019s been one of the better ones.\u201d Jennings\u2019s passage into the England team has a familiar ring. His mother hails from Sunderland; his father, Ray, from Johannesburg, played as a wicketkeeper against the rebel sides touring South Africa in the 80s and has since become a formidable coach \u2013 and not the type of man with whom you would like to pick an argument.   Related: Liam Dawson surprised by England call but Keaton Jennings can stake claim    Jennings went to the same school, King Edward VII in Johannesburg, as his father and a host of other South African cricketers, including Graeme Smith, Quinton de Kock and Stephen Cook. He captained South Africa\u2019s Under-19 side but after finishing school, in 2011, he left for Durham. \u201cThe guys up north made me feel very welcome \u2013 Stokesey, Colly [Paul Collingwood], Woody [Mark\u00a0Wood], they\u2019ve been three of the main drivers along with Mark Stoneman in helping me settle down and pave my life in England,\u201d said Jennings. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m feeling very comfortable\u00a0and very English, despite my accent.\u201d His father coached him in his youth and Jennings Jr says they have a very good relationship. He sometime refers to him as \u201ccoach\u201d rather than \u201cdad\u201d and he speaks about him with refreshing candour. \u201cI remember when I was nine or 10 we went to the nets. We were training and it was one of those days when I decided not to listen. He threw me the first ball, I got out. Second ball, I got out. He said: \u2018You get out one more time and we\u2019re going home.\u2019 He threw me another ball, I got out. He put his bag down and walked off. From that day forward he was \u2018Coachy\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m probably closer to him than I am to anyone else in the world, as a father, a role model and a coach. I\u2019m blessed to have a person I trust with my life and who will guide my career. The outward persona is of a very hard, concrete man; in the family house he\u2019s very loving and gentle.\u201d Jennings\u2019s career takes on a new dimension this week with the scrutiny of millions as he prepares for a Test debut at the Wankhede Stadium. It will be more daunting than opening the batting at Chester-le-Street, but he sounds up for it: \u201cI don\u2019t think of it as pressure. I have always been told pressure is a privilege. It is one of the things Dad tried to drum into me as a kid. I like to think I bring a bit of positive energy and a smile to the group. I am generally quite a happy guy. Hopefully this week we can land a few jabs and a few haymakers.\u201d The inclusion of Jennings is likely to be one of two changes to the England side for the fourth Test, starting on Thursday, which England must win to have a chance of levelling the series. Stuart Broad was off his long run in training and the expectation is that he will replace Gareth Batty in the side as England opt for a bowling attack with four pacemen and two spinners for the first time this winter. This potential change will not reflect any notion that the ruddy pitch at the Wankhede Stadium is unlikely to help spinners, just the simple fact that England\u2019s third spinner, whoever it has been, has not contributed much throughout the tour. It is remarkable that England have\u00a0won their past two Tests in Mumbai \u2013 in 2012 and 2006. It would be\u00a0mildly astonishing if they made it three in a row.", "title": "Keaton Jennings puts the accent on runs as England\u2019s Mumbai Test looms", "sentences": ["\u201cIn the last 12 hours turning up with the guys in Dubai has been a little surreal,\u201d he said."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-06T16:25:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/07/keaton-jennings-open-batting-alastair-cook-fourth-test-cricket-england-india", "tags": ["England in India 2016-17", "England cricket team", "Alastair Cook", "India cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Keaton Jennings will make his England debut in the fourth Test against India that begins on Thursday, a match that could see Jake Ball recalled to the side amid lingering doubts over the fitness of Stuart Broad. Alastair Cook, who in Jennings will have his 11th opening partner since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012, rated Broad\u2019s chances of a return following a foot tendon injury as 50-50 but the bowler was scarcely involved in training on Wednesday. While fast bowlers often rest up the day before a Test, Broad was looking to prove his fitness after missing the defeat in Mohali. He was expected to replace the off-spinner Gareth Batty and England could turn to Broad\u2019s Nottinghamshire team-mate Ball, who made his debut last summer, ahead of fellow reserve seamer Steven Finn.   Related: MCC recommends sendings off be introduced into laws of cricket    A further option for Cook and Trevor Bayliss is the uncapped left-armer Liam Dawson, who is also on standby for a possible Test debut should England opt to take three spinners into the match on a Mumbai pitch expected to turn. The 24-year-old Jennings has replaced Haseeb Hameed in the lineup, after the teenager suffered a broken finger in Mohali that leaves England 2-0 down in the series with two Tests to play. He comes into the side after a breakthrough county season for Durham and with a hundred to his name when captaining the Lions against the United Arab Emirates in Dubai last week. \u201cKeaton will make his debut. It\u2019s a great opportunity for the guy,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe\u2019s in good touch and he\u2019s spent time in the middle for the Lions, and it will be a special day for him. It\u2019s similar to what happened to me 10 years ago, flying out 48 hours before the game [for his debut in Nagpur in 2006].\u201d \u201cI had never met him properly before, so it could have been daunting but having [his Durham team-mate] Ben Stokes around has helped. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders \u2013 mentally very strong \u2013 and so we wish him all the luck. It\u2019s disappointing about Hameed \u2013 we have found player there \u2013 but if Keaton comes in it will add to our top-order players.\u201d Cook moved to clarify an assertion by Bayliss that he, not the captain, will deliver a reminder to the players over the need to bat positively in Mumbai. There is a feeling that after racking up 537 in Rajkot they have lost their way. Those comments could have been interpreted as a challenge to Cook\u2019s authority \u2013 Bayliss has previously maintained the primacy of the captain \u2013 but the 31-year-old was fully aware a reminder would be issued and agrees with the message. Cook said: \u201cI knew what was coming out, we chatted after Mohali and as part of the leadership group we discussed how we wanted to play and what had happened after the first Test. We have to take the second innings of Vizag out of the equation [when looking to bat out for a draw] and I do wonder if that tied into the third Test. There was a hangover and we went back into our shells. \u201cIt was a clear message we want more intent. The team responded to something similar in his first game in Cardiff during 2015 Ashes Test. Hopefully we go back to that level. Rajkot was our blueprint. It wasn\u2019t Trevor saying it, I was part of the conversation and I agree our players play better with a direction.\u201d Asked if he and Bayliss are aligned in their outlook, Cook said: \u201cYes, we are trying to win games of cricket for England. My batting has been about wearing the opposition down but that doesn\u2019t change the intent I need to have. There is definitely different approaches, it\u2019s not just fours and sixes, it\u2019s the intent to score that gets you in good positions.\u201d India will be without Ajinkya Rahane for the final two Tests after the middle-order batsman, who has struggled to make an impact, suffered a broken finger during net practice.

Nine hours later, with a couple more heart-in-mouth moments along the way, the 24-year-old was raising his bat at the Wankhede Stadium in celebration after becoming the 19th England batsman to taste the sweet success of scoring a Test century on debut. It is not possible to be certain, given a list that stretches back to the pre-YouTube days of WG Grace scoring 152 against Australia at The Oval in 1880, but it is fair to assume that Jennings was the first to bring up the milestone with a reverse-swept four off the spinner. This was a moment of nerveless audacity from the left-hander on 96, who only three days earlier had begun life as part of the senior England squad after flying in from the Lions camp in Dubai as a replacement for the injured Haseeb Hameed.

I thought I had mucked up and got it wrong. But then I realised. In that moment you don\u2019t want to go ballistic but the emotion, elation and pride and satisfaction that came over me was really special. It\u2019s been a dream come true and it\u2019s just surreal that it\u2019s come on debut.\u201d If control (and occasional brutality) was the hallmark of his 112 then things began in shaky fashion when, on nought, Jennings edged Umesh Yadav to gully in the third over of the day only to find Karun Nair in generous mood. \u201cWhen the ball looped up to gully, my heart was in my mouth and I just kind of thought: \u2018Oh no, you\u2019ve got nought in your first innings.\u2019 I had a little bit of luck, but I suppose that\u2019s the way the game goes sometimes,\u201d said Jennings, who also survived a tight lbw shout on 10 from Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

Well played Keaton Jennings.\u201d These are sensitive times for South African cricket, with three (now former) internationals in recent weeks having signed for English counties before next season \u2013 on Kolpak deals \u2013 in what is becoming something of an increasing cricketing exodus for reasons both financial and quota-related.   Related: England\u2019s Keaton Jennings stuns India with century on his Test debut    But Jennings did not exploit any loopholes. His mother is English and he is open about the fact that when he renounced his domestic status in South Africa as a player with Gauteng in 2012 and began a four-year qualification period, he made a considered career choice that was open to him. His father, Ray, a former South Africa wicketkeeper during the country\u2019s years in sporting isolation and who honed his game from a young age, told him the English game represented the best place for him to live out his own dream. It was also a decision that reflected how at home he had been made to feel when joining the Durham academy the previous year. The accent may always be more biltong than Byker Grove but speak to those involved in the rise of Jennings and they will tell you about a young man who is loyal, hard-working, honest and very much part of the furniture. Little wonder they are desperate for him to stay, given he could enact an exit clause in his contract following their enforced relegation for financial reasons. Jennings, who was presented his new cap in the morning by the club\u2019s chairman-elect, Ian Botham, was the 10th England cricketer to roll off their production line and his innings, like the measured unbeaten 25 from his county team-mate Ben Stokes that steered the side to stumps, is the latest reminder of the debt the country owes them.", "title": "Keaton Jennings \u2018bit the bullet and went for it\u2019 to claim century on England debut | Ali Martin", "sentences": ["This was a moment of nerveless audacity from the left-hander on 96, who only three days earlier had begun life as part of the senior England squad after flying in from the Lions camp in Dubai as a replacement for the injured Haseeb Hameed."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-08T15:49:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/11/tina-brown-the-trumps-look-like-a-kardashian-camelot", "tags": ["Media", "Magazines", "Newspapers & magazines"], "article": "On the night of the US presidential election, Tina Brown was at a party hosted by Snapchat deep in liberal elite Manhattan. There she was, gossiping away, when her husband Harry \u2013 aka the celebrated journalist, Sir Harold Evans \u2013 appeared. \u201cI was holding a plate of sushi,\u201d she says, in a voice that is eight parts brisk Home Counties to two parts twangy Upper East Side. \u201cHe said: \u2018Things are going very badly for Hillary.\u2019 Well, that was the end of the chatting for me. After that, I was glued to a screen in a corner.\u201d Was she expecting what happened next? \u201cNo, none of us were. Though it\u2019s fair to say that every time I saw Trump walk across the stage with the family, I thought: my God, they look like the Kardashian Camelot. Beautiful girls married to good-looking guys; the big patriarch with the private plane. I mean, it\u2019s Dyyy-nasty. That is a show people want to watch. Do they want to watch a show with the Clintons earnestly discussing healthcare? No, they don\u2019t. They want a show about making it.\u201d    Rudolph Giuliani is off his trolley. He\u2019s turned into this teeth-gnashing ghoul    Brown, of course, knows all about making it, having once taken New York by storm. When she became the editor of Vanity Fair in 1984, moreover, it was her salaried duty to chronicle the lives of the Trumps of this world \u2013 an interest she kept up even when, eight years later, she took over at the New Yorker, something of a hushed library beside the glitzy shopping mall that was VF (she sent the New Yorker writer Mark Singer, to his horror, straight out to follow the Donald, an experience he recently revisited in a funny book). So while she is horrified by Trump\u2019s victory, and in particular by those he is gathering round him \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m utterly aghast at the prospect of  Stephen Bannon [founder of the right-wing news site, Breitbart] in the White House; any way you slice that, it\u2019s intolerable, he\u2019s a thug\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s also possible to detect a certain fascination in her voice when she talks of him. \u201cThere are some things he can achieve because of who he is,\u201d she says. \u201cObama tried for eight years to get infrastructure built, and was denied. But Trump understands building. It\u2019s the only thing he does understand. He\u2019ll be committed to that, and he won\u2019t be denied.\u201d Perhaps, too, the journalist in her is hooked on the story. \u201cThe stage is set for internal strife, conflict and chaos,\u201d she goes on, the relish in her voice fighting the disgust almost to the ground. \u201cWe wait with bated breath to hear who is secretary of state. Giuliani [Rudolph, formerly mayor of New York], is off his trolley. He\u2019s turned into this teeth-gnashing ghoul. It\u2019s absolutely bizarre.\u201d Brown is in London only briefly. The night before I meet her, she hosted a salon-style event for Women in the World, the feminist roadshow she set up in 2010 following her departure from The Daily Beast, the ailing website she co-founded and of which she was editor-in-chief. Later, she will fly home to New York. She looks immaculate \u2013 trousers, blazer, Givenchy handbag the size of the Welsh parliament \u2013 but a little tired, too. There is something distracted about her, as if she is only going through the motions.     On song: Tina Brown with Hillary Clinton at a Women In The World summit held In New York. Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images    I was in the audience at the event, which was held somewhat bizarrely in the offices of a Westminster PR company, attended only by invited guests, and sponsored by Mastercard. It was an interesting, inspiriting evening, but the venue and the size of the crowd seemed not to match the starry profile of the guests, who had been flown in specially (the exception being the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson). First up, to postmortem Hillary\u2019s defeat, was a panel comprising Jane Harman, formerly a representative for California and now the president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center; Joy-Ann Reid, a presenter for MSNBC; and Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi immigrant to the US and the founder of Women for Women International. This was followed by a conversation about reconciliation and forgiveness between two mothers, Bushra Awad, a Palestinian, and Robi Damelin, an Israeli, both of whom lost a son in the ongoing conflict between their nations. Finally, there was Davidson, delivering her usual blend of politics and sass.    My advice to Hillary Clinton would be never to ask for another dime from anybody ever again    To the casual observer, it may appear as though with this venture, Brown has simply jumped on the current wave of feminism as if it were just another trend (all the more so if you consider that she has never particularly identified as a feminist herself). But she doesn\u2019t see it like this. \u201cI didn\u2019t begin Women in the World because I\u2019m a feminist,\u201d she says. \u201cI began it because I\u2019m a journalist and a storyteller. I see these events as live journalism, a pop-up magazine. I\u2019d been on the board of Vital Voices [an NGO that trains emerging women leaders and social entrepreneurs] and I kept meeting incredible women from Africa, India and the Middle East. I thought their stories were amazing and deserved a platform. So I put on a little conference, and it took off. People loved it, and wanted more. After two years, we moved into the Lincoln Center, hosting crowds of 2,500 every day.\u201d It now hosts similar events everywhere from India to Dubai, as well as smaller gatherings like the one last night. \u201cThe more people are on their screens, the more they want to get away from them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is this hunger for deep diving. You just don\u2019t get to see bright women going at it like that. That\u2019s what people like about it. You don\u2019t get to see [female] brain power over that length of time. You turn on the TV, and there are just two slightly snippy women arguing with each other about Brexit or something.\u201d At the London event, two words kept coming up: \u201cmisogyny\u201d and \u201cauthenticity\u201d. The increasing use of the first of these she attributes mostly to social media: if people deploy it a lot these days, it\u2019s because they have no choice but to call a spade a spade, given the nature and extent of the abuse of women online. Nevertheless, I sense it\u2019s not a word she often uses herself. Authenticity, however, is another matter. This is her new watchword, post election. \u201cWomen are continually pushing themselves into one stereotype or another to please someone else,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is difficult to keep sight of who you are. But Ruth Davidson, for one, has lived her own truth, and that is the future.\u201d     Hat trick: Tina Brown, editor of Tatler magazine, with the rest of the publication\u2019s staff at their Mayfair office, in 1979. Brown became editor when she was only 25 years old. Photograph: Graham Morris/Getty Images    To what degree, thinking back, did Brown stereotype herself? \u201cQuite a bit. When I went to America, I had to get much more groomed and glossy looking. I did feel pressure, particularly at Cond\u00e9 Nast [owner of VF and the New Yorker], a company that expects its editors to look a certain way. At times, I felt imprisoned by that.\u201d It was partly to escape this that she left Cond\u00e9 Nast, though given that she went off to set up the ill-fated Talk magazine for Miramax, a journal launched with the most Hollywood of parties, it\u2019s hard to take this entirely seriously (also, I saw her heels last night, and they were higher than the late Raine Spencer\u2019s hair). But I digress. It is, she thinks, still too easy to get \u201cdrowned out\u201d as a woman. One of the reasons she believes Hillary won so much respect during the campaign was because she was publicly bullied by a man for week after week, yet never lost her cool: \u201cIt was awesome.\u201d As a result, there is, she says, a sense of mourning among the women of America. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re Hillary groupies. It\u2019s that the outcome replays for them the trauma of all the times they\u2019ve had their work minimised while a guy who was unprepared walked in and took the job and did it badly.\u201d Brown knows Clinton a little; she was Talk\u2019s first cover star. How will she be feeling? \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable. She will feel: I failed twice, and because I failed, we have Trump. She\u2019s got a hard four years ahead. But she\u2019s been an incredible advocate for women, and that\u2019s perhaps what she should spend her time doing. Her foundation should probably cease to exist, though. My advice to her would be never to ask for another dime from anybody ever again.\u201d If Brown was beginning her own career now, would it be easier or harder? She only half answers. \u201cYounger women are less encumbered than older ones. That\u2019s the difference between Ruth, say, and Hillary. Older women are far more guarded. They\u2019ve had to wear masks to get where they are, and those can\u2019t just be ripped off. You become a certain way, like Theresa May. I\u2019ve got a few battle scars, but I wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently.\u201d She was only 25 when she became the editor of Tatler, rescuing the debby dinosaur from certain death. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you just rush in, right? Only as I got older did I realise how differently women are treated. They just are. There\u2019s hardly even any point in talking about it.\u201d What percentage of her, at the time, was anxious? \u201cAnxious? Actually, not at all. I knew what I wanted to do. I was very clear. It was a question of barrelling in, and getting a team in place. I love building institutions. I know how to do that.\u201d So she wasn\u2019t secretly throwing up in the ladies? \u201cI was sometimes at Vanity Fair. I found it very, very stressful. I had two children [Isabella and George, now grown up], and my son has Asperger\u2019s, and I had to get out of the office to see them.\u201d     What an honour: Tina Brown with her husband Harold Evans after she received her CBE in 2000. Photograph: PA    Her burden, however, was lightened immeasurably by Evans, the man, 25 years her senior, with whom she fell in love more or less the moment she clapped eyes on him (they met at the Sunday Times, of which he was then editor, and married, following his divorce from Enid, with whom he had three children, in 1981). \u201cI could not have done anything in my career if I hadn\u2019t been married to Harry,\u201d she says. \u201cHe has encouraged me, supported me, loved me, picked me up. Some men are very competitive. I know women who are very successful whose husbands clearly resent it; they try not to show it, but they do. But Harry has always been a huge feminist. He likes strong women. His mother was strong, his first wife was strong. You can only like and love strong women if you are very secure yourself, but his mum loved him and made him feel great and he has always been very confident. I was very lucky with that \u2013 and frankly, without it, I would just have been so lonely.\u201d Not that working was something she thought of as a choice, exactly: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute psychic necessity. Oh, my God, you jump in, and it\u2019s a great distraction.\u201d When she left Oxford, where her suitors famously included Martin Amis, she wanted to be a novelist and a playwright. \u201cBut I got sidetracked. It [journalism] is addictive. I love to respond. I need to do that. I\u2019m a news junkie, and I\u2019m married to a news junkie.\u201d Brown is 63 now and, as she notes miserably, journalism is in a parlous state. Does she plan to keep going? What else does she have up her tailored sleeve? \u201cI don\u2019t know! Maybe I\u2019ll keel over. What do you want me to do?\u201d Oh, that\u2019s easy: I want her to finish the memoir she is supposed to be writing. \u201cWell, thank you for nagging me. Actually, it is turning into something slightly different. It will mainly be about Vanity Fair now because I have come to feel that the 1980s was an especially interesting time. I kept a diary all the way through, so I\u2019m using that. But it\u2019s also a portrait of someone I no longer am, so that\u2019s interesting, too.\u201d How would she describe the difference between Tina Brown circa 1986, and the Tina Brown of 2016? \u201cWell, it was a surface time.\u201d Is she kinder these days? \u201cYeah.\u201d     Tina Brown photographed in her East Side apartment in New York Photograph: Christopher Lane for the Observer    What about Britain? She and Evans are US citizens now. Does she miss it? \u201cVery much,\u201d she says, slightly to my amazement. \u201cWe talk about coming back a lot. I\u2019m more drawn to London lately than I am to New York. So, we\u2019ll see.\u201d When she leaves the hotel bar, her stride, so businesslike on arrival, is hesitant, almost dawdling.", "title": "Tina Brown: \u2018The Trumps look like a Kardashian Camelot\u2019", "sentences": ["After two years, we moved into the Lincoln Center, hosting crowds of 2,500 every day.\u201d It now hosts similar events everywhere from India to Dubai, as well as smaller gatherings like the one last night."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-11T00:05:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/dec/12/attack-drones-privatisation-urban-airspace", "tags": ["Cities", "Drones (non-military)", "Privatisation", "Air transport", "World news", "Technology"], "article": "We woke up before dawn and caught the first train to Waterloo, so we could capture some aerial footage in the early morning London light with no one around. We were interested in using a drone to get a vantage point that no rooftop could offer, looking down on the under-renovation South Bank Tower. Lifting off from a grassy, flat expanse next to the river Thames, we quickly vaulted to the height of a 30-storey building and began capturing slow, sweeping images from a bird\u2019s-eye view. But then a security guard emerged from the building and ran towards us. \u201cYou can\u2019t fly that here,\u201d he yelled. We were keeping the drone within our line of sight, as per Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations, and my co-flyer Adam Fish responded: \u201cSorry but we can. We checked the regs and we are 50 metres from the building, and this isn\u2019t a congested area.\u201d   Related: The privatisation of cities' public spaces is escalating. It is time to take a stand    Adam showed him a map. Then the security guard looked up at the drone hovering over the building, and said: \u201cYeah, but we own it.\u201d  \u201cYou own what?\u201d Adam replied.  \u201cThe air, mate. We own the air.\u201d Urban airspace is being radically reshaped by the proliferation of drones \u2013 a process which is quickly slicing the air into private strips. Urban citizens are at risk of losing access to a valuable public resource as corporations are given prioritisation in the skies above our heads.  And while the grounding of personal drones might be a nuisance for hobbyists, it becomes a threat to democracy when journalists cannot use these tools to document and report on the activities of the elite.         Drone footage of the Shard in London, by Jack and Nathaniel Durman    British cities are a leading testbed for professional drone delivery services. Until recently, UK \u201cdrone code\u201d was simple \u2013 pilots had to see their drone, keep their aircraft 50 metres away from people and property, and stay clear of airports. Most pilots heed the code and breaches are few and far between.  However, these rules are being bent to allow Amazon, as part of their launch of PrimeAir, to engage in extended semi-autonomous flights where the pilot cannot see the drone. A 2015 email chain between Amazon and CAA employees, released through a Freedom of Information Act request, reveals a cosy relationship between the two.    Is it in the public interest to create air lanes for Amazon but deny them to hospitals, researchers or activists?    More recently, it was announced that drones will be allowed to make deliveries to residents of Spire London, an \u00a3800m Chinese-owned skyscraper currently under construction near Canary Wharf. This would require an exemption to the CAA rules about flying in congested areas. Just as skyscrapers have become a visible marker of social inequality in the UK, the ability to fly will also be granted according to privilege, further solidifying the relationship between height and power in the capital. Cities around the world are experimenting with different approaches to incorporating drones into airspace. Australia was the first to deregulate commercial drones, granting the firm Flirtey the rights to deliver goods in Sydney in 2013. Canada has virtually deregulated airspaces by creating a flexible permit process for commercial operators, and a blanket exemption for small drones even in busy cities like Toronto. In Stockholm, however, in the interest of protecting citizen privacy, piloting drones has been made all but impossible by the implementation of a laborious licensing process. In Lagos, Nigeria concerns over terrorism have grounded commercial drones. They are banned entirely in Nairobi, Kenya. Strict regulation makes sense in some cases as drones can be dangerous if flown recklessly. A few people have done worrisome things like strapping guns to them, landing them on the Japanese prime minister\u2019s office filled with irradiated sand, and crashing them into the White House lawn. Yet regulations are often passed without public discussion, in reaction to isolated and anecdotal incidents.     Geofences are meant to prevent drones approaching prisons or power stations. Photograph: Bradley L Garrett    One response to these incidents has been for governments to encourage manufacturers to self-regulate. Software limitations such as geofences around prisons and power stations seem to be little deterrent to those determined to use drones inappropriately. In 2015, for instance, Nottingham resident Nigel Wilson was convicted of nine breaches of an Air Navigation Order after flying over numerous football grounds and tourist attractions. Security guards around the world attempting to stifle activities like Wilson\u2019s urban piloting are going to struggle, though. The air is becoming saturated with flying things carrying all sorts of payloads. More than one million drones were sold in 2015, with the global market expected to reach $1bn (\u00a3800m) by 2018. Like many new technologies, drones, and the ways that they are being deployed, are triggering debates about who has the right to fly \u2013 and where. The ability of journalists to use drones has been critical to the changing nature of news gathering. According to the National Union of Journalists, in 2011 \u201cAustralia\u2019s Channel Nine was barred from visiting a remote immigration detention centre \u2013 so flew a drone over the site to get footage\u201d. In 2016, the BBC flew over a Met training facility in Gravesend on the Thames Estuary, locating two water cannons that Boris Johnson, as Mayor of London, had purchased to repress future protests. Even more concerning is the Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) put in place above the protest against an oil pipeline across the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, by authorities and the US FAA to stop demonstrators from documenting police abuses. Police admitted firing sponge rounds, bean bag rounds, stinger rounds, tear gas grenades, pepper spray, Mace, Tasers and a sound weapon.         Team BlackSheep in Dubai    A similar situation unfolded in Ferguson, Missouri in 2015 during the unrest after the shooting of Michael Brown. Audio transcripts obtained by the Associated Press made it clear the TFR had been set up specifically to prevent \u201cmedia\u201d from flying over places where police were clashing with citizens. Legal experts say these restrictions were a blatant violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution, protecting freedom of the press. Many of these pilots may not be paid journalists, but as Jason Koebler argued in Motherboard: \u201cBy any definition of the word, the drone pilots documenting the Dakota Access Pipeline protests are conducting journalism. The videos, live streamed to Facebook and later posted on YouTube, have shown human rights abuses, caught police in lies, and \u2013 in the case of the numerous videos that show their drones being shot at by police \u2013 have documented law enforcement committing federal crimes.\u201d Is it in the public interest to create exclusive air lanes for Amazon but deny them to photographers recording events, hospitals delivering blood, researchers collecting data or activists making their voices heard? Leigh Raymond, professor of political science at Purdue University, Indiana, advances the wonky but useful concept of an \u201catmospheric commons\u201d to describe our shared rights to the air. Perhaps it is time to imagine the atmospheric commons as a space for public rambling and exploration with drones, balloons, satellites and as-yet-unforeseen flying objects.    Related: Hands off #OurLand: gifting green space to QPR highlights wider threat to cities    Geographer Jeremy Crampton suggests that not doing so could lead to dire consequences: \u201cIt has been long established that the sky is public \u2013 otherwise each airplane would have to get permission to fly over your property. This is akin to the concept of international waters on the ocean. But as with international waters, this public space is becoming increasingly and deliberately enclosed, in what might constitute a modern \u2018enclosure of the commons\u2019.\u201d Commons, whether on the ground or in the air, will continue to be contested, since they are, by their very nature, shared. If you look up, in any city in the world, what you see is a common: a space where our work lives and personal lives can and should intermingle. Flying around cities, as we found when ascending over the South Bank Tower, reveals a system of invisible power \u2013 including regulations and geofences \u2013 that are governing our aerial endeavours. What comes into focus is the vertical enclosure of commons; an air grab rather than a land grab. Thus it is all the more vital that we become pilots and take to the skies before they become parcelled into another domain for the rich and the powerful. Becoming urban pilots is not about novelty or showmanship, it\u2019s about exercising our rights.

Crowley is booked for seven rides, four at Lingfield on Wednesday afternoon and a further three at Kempton\u2019s evening meeting. The 38-year-old expects to ride in Qatar and Dubai in the new year and plans to be race-fit by the time he gets to the Middle East. While likely to be sharper for the outing he may nonetheless be able to get on the scoreboard immediately as his first ride, Ettu, was trading at only 5-4 when betting opened on Tuesday night.   Related: Walter Swinburn obituary    \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to getting back,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have a nice, easy day coming back \u2026 I wasn\u2019t expecting so many rides, but I\u2019ve got to start somewhere.\u201d There was reason to fear a much more significant injury to Crowley in the immediate aftermath of the Kempton pile-up on the last day of October; he was treated alongside Tylicki on the track for an hour before being taken to hospital with a suspected spinal injury. In the event he was able to return home to Sussex that same night, his agent describing him as feeling \u201clike he\u2019s had six rounds in the ring with Anthony Joshua\u201d. \u201cI was laid up for a few weeks and I took a bit of a bashing,\u201d Crowley said on Tuesday. \u201cI started off riding my children\u2019s ponies, then moved on to the bigger ones. I\u2019m fairly fit and I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d Crowley\u2019s status has changed since he was last seen on a horse, the veteran having been signed up to replace Paul Hanagan as first jockey to Sheikh Hamdan al-Maktoum. The main benefit of such a post is generally thought to be the chance to get on regally bred stock of the kind that might win a Classic, but Crowley would dearly like to defend his hard-won title while also fulfilling his obligations in the famous blue and white colours. \u201cWillie Carson was champion when he was retained so it\u2019s certainly not impossible. I\u2019ll do my best to retain it, but riding for Sheikh Hamdan is my priority. Last year I didn\u2019t think about the championship until after Glorious Goodwood [in late July], so it will be much the same this year. We\u2019ll get Goodwood out of the way and see where we are. If we\u2019re close enough, we\u2019ll give it a go.\u201d Carson was among those paying tribute to Walter Swinburn as racing came to terms with the loss of the Derby-winning jockey, who died on Monday at the age of 55. Alluding to Swinburn\u2019s Epsom win on Shergar when the jockey was 19, Carson said: \u201cHe rode a Derby winner before I even rode a winner at the same age. Isn\u2019t that incredible? He got more excitement out of the big days than he did on the little days. He was as cool as cool could be.\u201d Criquette Head-Maarek, who provided Swinburn with a Guineas success on Hatoof, described him as \u201cone of the greatest ever jockeys\u201d, a sentiment echoed by Saeed bin Suroor, trainer of Swinburn\u2019s third Derby winner, Lammtarra. \u201cHe was one of the best jockeys in the world,\u201d said Bin Suroor. \u201cHe proved that on Lammtarra, but he proved it many times. I used to travel Europe with him. He was a very good friend and we\u2019ll miss him a lot.\u201d There was no update from the British Horseracing Authority with regard to the penalty published on Monday in relation to the trainer Jim Best. The disciplinary panel said his licence should be suspended for six months, a less onerous punishment than an outright ban from the sport for which the BHA had argued.

Doctors delivered her baby at the Portland hospital in London on Tuesday where they said the treatment would give hope to other young women whose fertility was at risk from medical treatments for cancer and other disorders. Al Matrooshi was born with an inherited blood condition called beta thalassaemia which can be fatal if left untreated. But because the chemotherapy with which doctors tackle the disorder damages the ovaries, she had her right ovary removed at the age of nine. The tissue was frozen and kept in storage in Leeds where the operation had taken place.   Related: I had my eggs frozen. I wish someone had told me how difficult it was | Eleanor Morgan    Al Matrooshi had chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant at Great Ormond Street in London to treat her blood condition before doctors in Denmark transplanted slivers of her unfrozen ovarian tissue onto her left ovary, which had stopped working, and on to the side of her uterus. After the procedure, doctors found that Al Matrooshi\u2019s hormones returned to normal and her periods returned. To improve her chances of conceiving, she had IVF treatment with her husband Ahmed, which allowed doctors to implant two embryos into her womb earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s like a miracle,\u201d Al Matrooshi told the BBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting so long for this result: a healthy baby.\u201d Doctors have performed similar operations before and about 60 women have had their fertility restored with frozen ovarian tissue since 2001. Last year a woman who had an ovary frozen at the age of 13 gave birth after doctors used the tissue to restore her fertility. Al Matrooshi may be the first to have had her tissue stored before she reached puberty. In July, a 33-year-old woman in Edinburgh became the first in Britain to give birth after having frozen ovarian tissue returned to her body. She had had the material frozen in her early 20s after she was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. Doctors in Edinburgh are developing a service to store testicular tissue from boys as young as one to help those at risk of infertility after cancer treatment. Sara Matthews, a consultant gynaecologist at the Portland hospital, said that within three months of having her ovarian tissue re-implanted, Al Matrooshi went from being menopausal to having the ovary function of a normal woman in her 20s. Helen Picton, who oversaw the tissue-freezing at Leeds University, told the BBC that in Europe alone, several thousand girls and young women have had ovarian tissue frozen and stored.

Sassoon treated locks as millinery felt, to be cut and sculpted into \u201chats\u201d, uniformly imposed. Lewis, who has died aged 78, understood hair as organic, sensuous as fur, and that its owners might need psychological support more than a sharp shearing. \u201cWe\u2019d discuss how you felt, what you wanted to be,\u201d he told the style magazine Dazed in 2008. \u201cThen we would achieve it, together. The only way hair works is between two people.\u201d Lewis could do fashion \u2013 in 1966 he cropped, and his colourist Daniel Galvin bleached, the schoolgirl Lesley Hornby, and the resultant photograph, hung in the salon, was enough to start her modelling career as Twiggy. He was an early volunteer to style fashion shoots in studios and locations, which most name hairdressers would not do, since it was unprofitable; in the fashion-wig era, from the mid-1960s, his extravaganzas were the wild best. But Lewis\u2019s sympathy was more important to celebrities, who embodied their own and others\u2019 fantasies; he was discreet about Tony Curtis\u2019s toupee, patient with Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s hairpiece, calm when Mick and Bianca Jagger ranted in his salon. He unpicked and trimmed Bob Marley\u2019s dreadlocks. If a client was not willing, he did not attempt to persuade. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s advisers brought her in for a cut and \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t let me touch a strand \u2026 that was how she would keep it\u201d. It cost him effort to ascend. He was born in west London, the unwanted fourth child of a shady car salesman, John Lewis, and his wife, Amelia, of Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Leonard\u2019s education was minimal and the real flash of inspiration came from a 1952 French film, Coiffure Pour Dames, that he saw at the Curzon, Mayfair (Lewis was obsessed with the area), with the comic Fernandel as a sheep-shearer who remakes himself into a stylist adored by Parisian society. Lewis worked at auctions with his father, who knew many noted crooks, and as a labourer and barrow-boy, and saved enough to pay for three years of apprenticeship with Rose Evansky of Mount Street, who died last month. Boys of rough background were not usually accepted in Mayfair salons \u2014 the pinnacle of the UK trade, of near-Parisian glamour \u2014 but Lewis got in, and Evansky\u2019s pioneering blow-drying influenced him. Lewis had a year at Sassoon, then set up a small salon on a bank overdraft in Duke Street in partnership with a fellow Sassoon defector, Raphael Santarossa. His final transition was to his Upper Grosvenor Street salon, The House of Leonard. The name was a bit much. So was the venue. Lewis\u2019s childhood had been dingy and cramped, and to rent five Georgian floors in Mayfair in his 20s was making it. He avoided the traditional local chandelier and frou-frou decor, aiming instead for the buzz of the new bistro restaurants, like his favourite, San Lorenzo \u2013 he was more chef-patron than ma\u00eetre-coiffure, despite his staff retinue. Lewis would listen to a client before starting to cut, then requested silence. The top floor was opened as a barbershop for clients\u2019 menfolk, Galvin\u2019s radical colour experiments were given another floor, and the in-house chemist reformulated the bright textile dyes of the young Zandra Rhodes to apply to hair. She designed the salon\u2019s gowns. Models \u2013 Marie Helvin, Jerry Hall \u2014 brought in music people (the Stones, Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust phase), who attracted the film folk (Warren Beatty, Audrey Hepburn, Liza Minnelli, Meryl Streep). Lewis already had a connection to the movie world, as hairdresser to the women of the Carreras family, which owned the Hammer horror production company, and had worked on the films: \u201cI just loved the theatricality, all the lights.\u201d So he was up for Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) \u2013 Lewis offered his wigmaker to knot the ape-suits, and styled them, no different from toupee-shaping \u2014 and confected the high-frothed, pastel-tinted 18th-century wigs for Barry Lyndon (1975). Kubrick didn\u2019t want artifice for A Clockwork Orange (1971), so Lewis hacked its brutal proto-punk spikes on the actors for real. Much of the charm of The Boy Friend (1971) lies in Lewis\u2019s sweet bob for Twiggy. Murder on the Orient Express (1974) was heavily Lewis-bewigged. Lewis lived large and was a spendthrift: town house, country house, restaurants, clubbing. He had little financial acumen, was slow to open salons he could not personally supervise and did not see the future in the name-brand products that began to dominate rivals\u2019 businesses. In 1986 he collapsed in a Park Lane hotel \u2013 Mayfair, of course \u2013 and had successful surgery for a brain tumour. There followed alcoholism, bulimia and epilepsy. He was bankrupted, and he survived on income support in the home of his much older sister, until old colleagues, former trainees, and clients set up a trust to fund his nursing-home care. He kept his scissors, and a few friends, including Jack Nicholson, visited for a trim. His first marriage, to the model Ricci Wade, ended in 1977; in 1980 he was briefly married to Petra Arzberger, who encouraged him to open branches in New York and Dubai.

Earlier this month Mir Shakil ur Rahman, a Dubai-based media tycoon who owns the Jang newspaper group and Geo television, won a significant victory against ARY, which like most other Pakistani television stations is answerable to British courts because it rebroadcasts in the UK. The court found ARY guilty of making 24 separate defamatory claims against Rahman and ordered the channel to pay damages of \u00a3185,000. When costs are included ARY\u2019s total bill is thought to be almost \u00a33m. Salman Raja, a leading lawyer, said Rahman\u2019s victory would act as a deterrent because television stations could no longer rely on complaints getting lost in Pakistan\u2019s dysfunctional legal system. \u201cThe lack of judges, strikes by lawyers and delaying tactics mean a civil case can take 20 years to get resolved in Pakistan,\u201d Raja said. \u201cEven if you took it all the way to the supreme court you might get damages of less than 15m Pakistani rupees [\u00a3115,000].\u201d ARY is also being sued in the UK by Mian Muhammad Mansha, a banking tycoon said to be one of Pakistan\u2019s richest men, after the channel accused him of fraud. Ofcom, the British media regulator, is also emerging as a forum for Pakistanis to complain about how they are treated by their own media. In November the watchdog ruled in favour of Chaudhry Barjees Tahir, a government minister, who complained he had been unfairly treated by ARY when a programme accused him of corruption. Ofcom also ruled in favour of the father of Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel prize-winning education activist who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012. The regulator said ARY had treated Ziauddin Yousafzai unfairly by not giving him an opportunity to respond to a programme featuring guests who alleged he had committed blasphemy and was a traitor \u201cagainst Pakistan, its ideology, its very existence\u201d. Yousafzai has now launched a legal case for damages against ARY. The UK is a lucrative media market, given the 1.7 million people with Pakistani links living in the country. Rahman has been publishing a daily Urdu paper in Britain since 1971. But ARY\u2019s crushing legal defeat highlights the stark contrast between the freewheeling journalistic standards of Pakistan and those in the UK, where media groups retain lawyers to check stories for potential libel. In court ARY did not attempt to defend any of the lurid claims it had made against Rahman as true. \u201cNo such defence could be properly pleaded, since there simply was no evidence to support it,\u201d the ruling said. Rahman was attacked during dozens of programmes in 2013-14 presented by Mubasher Lucman, a well-known anchor, who enlisted Islamic clerics to accuse the media owner of blasphemy and issue fatwas against him. Lucman, who refused to appear in the London court, also repeatedly accused Rahman of committing treason and working for Indian intelligence. One programme alleged that the Aman Ki Asha initiative, a long-running campaign by Geo to promote peace between Pakistan and India, was secretly funded by the Indian government and that Rahman had \u201ctherefore lied to and betrayed the people of Pakistan\u201d, the judgment said. The themes of disloyalty and working for Pakistan\u2019s arch-rival India echo those discreetly promoted to journalists by some military officers. \u201cMuch of this slanderous content is aired to serve political or military interests,\u201d said Huma Yusuf, a commentator. \u201cThis is a significant ruling because it will allow media groups to push back \u2013 they\u2019ll be able to argue to soften the rhetoric to avoid the same fate as ARY.  Rahman fell out spectacularly with the country\u2019s powerful military establishment in 2013 when Geo aired incendiary claims that the head of the army\u2019s intelligence wing had attempted to assassinate one of its leading journalists.  The army responded by demanding the cancellation of Geo\u2019s broadcasting licence. Cable television providers were persuaded to drop the channel and rivals piled in with attacks on the station. Quatrina Hosain, a journalist, said some anchors need little external encouragement to launch defamatory attacks on public figures and commercial rivals. \u201cUnfortunately, these kinds of wild allegations are very popular,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the irresponsible remarks by some anchors have stirred up extremists and can literally put people\u2019s lives in danger.\u201d ", "title": "Pakistani media on alert after TV channel\u2019s libel defeat in British court", "sentences": ["Earlier this month Mir Shakil ur Rahman, a Dubai-based media tycoon who owns the Jang newspaper group and Geo television, won a significant victory against ARY, which like most other Pakistani television stations is answerable to British courts because it rebroadcasts in the UK."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-16T12:15:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/16/the-grand-tour-jeremy-clarkson-goes-global-amazon", "tags": ["The Grand Tour", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Television", "Jeremy Clarkson"], "article": "We don\u2019t know how popular The Grand Tour is. Online content behemoths don\u2019t feel obliged to share viewing figures, and Amazon have made do with describing it as \u201cthe biggest show premiere ever on Amazon Prime Video\u201d. According to \u201cpiracy market data analysts\u201d MUSO, it\u2019s the most illegally downloaded show in the world. Even more illegally downloaded than Game of Thrones. But what proportion of the total audience is made up of illegals we don\u2019t know. And quite who that audience actually is, we have not much of a clue at all.  Top Gear was a British television show that found an international audience. The Grand Tour is an international show. According to the head of Netflix Ted Sarandos, who admittedly is not an unbiased observer, Amazon paid $250m to make 36 episodes of The Grand Tour. That is not the sort of budget usually afforded to a local TV show (each episode of Game of Thrones season six cost $10m \u2013 and you got dragons with that). When The Grand Tour launched last month it did so in four markets; the UK, the US, Germany and Japan. The full global rollout comes this month. The Grand Tour tent, meanwhile, is being put up everywhere from Johannesburg to Dubai. But is this show truly something for the global village?     Defiantly, almost foolhardily English \u2026 The Grand Tour. Photograph: Ellis O'Brian     There is an aspect to The Grand Tour that feels defiantly, almost foolhardily English. Of the five episodes so far, two have been staged in Whitby (a lovely town but not quite as internationally renowned as the other destinations, Palm Springs, Johannesburg and Rotterdam). The badinage, of which there is a lot, including an element called Conversation Street, finds humour in polite decorum being ruptured by Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s wilful boorishness. That\u2019s a very English style. The tame racing car driver is called \u201cthe American\u201d and is the British idea of a redneck (though to give him his due, he spends most of his time on screen tearing a strip off everything European). Then there\u2019s James May, a character so ineffably English that even his physical actions should come with subtitles.  So on the one hand you could imagine that The Grand Tour is selling a particular kind of Britishness to the world. On the other hand, there\u2019s Richard Hammond bundled under the boot of an Audi TT. In case you missed the skit from last week\u2019s episode, Hammond was stashed under a detachable bumper to prove how easy it would be to smuggle a migrant over a hard border, should you be so inclined and in possession of the appropriate German sports car. The segment was introduced by Clarkson, who described migrants hiding in container lorries as \u201cthe world\u2019s worst game of hide and seek\u201d and speculated that \u201cthere must be a better way to get into Britain\u201d. Soon enough, Hammond was bundled under the bumper and used as an impromptu parking radar.  Now, believe it or not, I\u2019m not interested in talking about why, in a world full of trouble, anyone would choose to make light of the trauma some will endure for a chance at the life so many of us take for granted. What I\u2019m interested in is who it was for. In a Top Gear incarnation it would make sense \u2013 the audience was Middle England/Yorkshire dads who vote Tory and have an important functionary\u2019s position at the golf club. But in The Grand Tour version? Well, Clarkson was very careful to use the term \u201chomeland security\u201d when talking about customs officials, so perhaps he\u2019s got the US minutemen constituency in mind. Given their decision to accept one million migrants from Syria, perhaps it plays big in Germany too.  As well as the migrant scene there was a skit about transgender traffic lights, which were apparently real but not put in context and therefore not only mockable in themselves but allowed to stand for a greater, broader idea of political correctness gone mad. Finally, the show\u2019s main feature \u2013 an amusing race of \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d cars, in which Clarkson contrived to build a structure entirely from leftover butchers\u2019 bones \u2013 seemed like it had been set up entirely for the purposes of delivering the ultimate punchline \u201cenvironmentalism doesn\u2019t work\u201d.     \u2018Environmentalism doesn\u2019t work\u2019 \u2026 last week, Clarkson contrived to build a structure made entirely from leftover butchers\u2019 bones. Photograph: Ellis O'Brian     All this stuff is a chauvinist strain of Englishness from which Top Gear always derived its most devoted viewers. But The Grand Tour\u2019s success seems dependent on it having international appeal. After all, as has already been observed, The Grand Tour isn\u2019t much about cars. There\u2019s one review a week, pretty much. The main features have steered away from the actual capabilities of motor vehicles, concentrating instead on the characters. Or character. The Grand Tour is about Clarkson. Or Clarksonism. Middle-aged white men angry at the world may be having a moment right now, but are they really that big in Japan? Does frustration at PC culture really boil people\u2019s blood outside of the anglo-saxon west? We may never know, or at least, we\u2019ll only get a sense when Amazon choose whether to renew the show or not. But as much as his fans might like to imagine otherwise, there may be limits to the appeal of Clarksonism. A final word from non-biased actor Sarandos: \u201cWe knew what it was worth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a play for that show, definitely, but we\u2019ve had every season of Top Gear on Netflix in most territories in the world, so we had a better sense than most of what the audience was for Top Gear on our platform.\u201d", "title": "The Grand Tour: Clarksonism goes global!", "sentences": ["The Grand Tour tent, meanwhile, is being put up everywhere from Johannesburg to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-16T12:44:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/16/horse-racing-tips-saturday-17-december", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Ascot 12.40 Wylde Magic 1.15 Top Notch 1.50 Join The Clan 2.25 Unowhatimeanharry 3.00 Another Hero 3.35 Modus (nap) Haydock   11.50 Pakora Du Lys 12.20 Cloudy Dream 12.55 Ryedale Racer 1.30 Gino Trail 2.05 Colin\u2019s Sister 2.40 Trickaway 3.15 Lettheriverrundry Lingfield   11.45 Mazaaji 12.15 Pinzolo 12.50 Warba 1.25 Somethingthrilling 2.00 Dubai Fashion 2.35 General Hazard 3.10 Ask The Guru 3.40 Fly True Newcastle   12.05 Dr West 12.35 Battle Of Shiloh 1.10 Ping 1.45 Volvalien 2.20 Bells On Sunday 2.55 No Planning (nb) 3.25 Teescomponents Lad", "title": "Horse racing tips: Saturday 17 December", "sentences": ["Ascot 12.40 Wylde Magic 1.15 Top Notch 1.50 Join The Clan 2.25 Unowhatimeanharry 3.00 Another Hero 3.35 Modus (nap) Haydock   11.50 Pakora Du Lys 12.20 Cloudy Dream 12.55 Ryedale Racer 1.30 Gino Trail 2.05 Colin\u2019s Sister 2.40 Trickaway 3.15 Lettheriverrundry Lingfield   11.45 Mazaaji 12.15 Pinzolo 12.50 Warba 1.25 Somethingthrilling 2.00 Dubai Fashion 2.35 General Hazard 3.10 Ask The Guru 3.40 Fly True Newcastle   12.05 Dr West 12.35 Battle Of Shiloh 1.10 Ping 1.45 Volvalien 2.20 Bells On Sunday 2.55 No Planning (nb) 3.25 Teescomponents Lad"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-16T16:35:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/17/england-india-liam-dawson-chennai", "tags": ["England in India 2016-17", "England cricket team", "India cricket team", "Cricket", "Moeen Ali", "Sport"], "article": "Trevor Bayliss has had precious little time to run the rule over county cricketers during his 18 months in charge of the England side and while this may change next summer, he is currently going on the words of his three fellow selectors and only very occasionally a personal hunch.

The first 20 balls were probably the most nervous I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d   Related: Liam Dawson surprised by England call but Keaton Jennings can stake claim    Dawson\u2019s confidence grew thereafter, however, showing the bit of mongrel that caught the eye of the England head coach during a net session for the Lions in Dubai last winter when staring down Virat Kohli after the India captain struck him with a poorly aimed throw as well as more than a bit of skill in his handling of the world\u2019s No1 spinner in Ravi Ashwin. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced this type of pressure before. but I think I\u2019m dealing with it pretty well. You make one Test debut and I was extremely excited and from a team point of view we said we wanted to finish this tour on a high and we\u2019re in a fairly good position.\u201d While the runs will do plenty for the 26-year-old, you suspect only a cascade of wickets will further his chances of a second cap next summer given England\u2019s current glut of all-rounders. Moeen Ali has the spin-bowling slot among these sewn up at present, albeit his 146 here has done plenty to help him nail down the top-five batting spot he so craves. \u201cIt\u2019s tough when you haven\u2019t got a consistent number,\u201d he said. \u201cWherever I\u2019m needed in the team I\u2019ll bat. I was batting at five at the start of the tour but now I\u2019m batting in four. It\u2019s a good place to bat but I\u2019d rather bat five. Hopefully, one day I\u2019ll have a settled spot.\u201d Despite an exasperating end \u2013 picking out the man on the hook following a score of earlier near-misses \u2013 Moeen\u2019s innings, the bulk of which came on the first day, was a pretty handy nudge to the management on this front, even when considering a pitch that thus far looked flat as a roti. It would be mean to criticise the surface though, with the match representing something of a triumph for the groundstaff given the devastation across Chennai that was wreaked by Monday\u2019s cyclone; the hot coals they used to dry out the strip took any life out of it but it is better than no match at all. If there is one legitimate grumble it would be with the rows of empty seats on a day when a number of supporters who walked up were greeted with sold-out signs at the ticket office.

He has garnered global plaudits for his oval-shaped Fuji Kindergarten, near his native Tokyo, where there are no physical boundaries between classrooms and the outdoors, and the roof forms part of the playground.    Seattle has a preschool for under-fives located in an elder care facility, with an average age of 92    Designed around a philosophy that values children\u2019s right to play as well as learn, Tezuka is determined to change the way we design for the youngest people in society. \u201cWe need discussion and debate on an international platform about whether the needs and rights of children to play and learn, uninhibited, are sufficiently understood and taken into account during the architectural design process,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you go to some kindergartens, their playgrounds are covered in plastic, everything\u2019s flat, and there\u2019s no challenge in their life. Maybe the children feel safe there when they\u2019re small, but they\u2019ve lost the chance to learn as they grow up.\u201d             The Fuji Kindergarten is quite the antidote to these sanitised designs: built in the shape of an oval with a perimeter of 183 metres, it is conceived as a single village for around 500 children. The interior is an integrated space with classrooms and recreational areas softly partitioned with furniture. Three 25-metre high preserved zelkova trees project up through the interior and roof decking for children to explore during break times. To achieve such a holistic approach, designers must engage with children as well as adults, says Diarmaid Lawlor, director of place at conference partner Architecture and Design Scotland. \u201cDesigners often ask the wrong questions at the wrong time,\u201d Lawlor says. \u201cThe question of space comes after the primary question of \u2018what does learning look like for you?\u2019 When you ask this question of carers and learners, you get a sense of their daily routine, and what spaces could accommodate that.\u201d In making time to have these discussions, he adds, it\u2019s also essential to keep in mind that people \u2013 not architects \u2013 are the experts in their own lives. According to Lawlor, the best-designed city for children would comprise three inter-locking elements: intergenerational spaces, life-long learning (linking early years education with the world of work), and putting special educational needs at the heart of learning, to create whole communities of learners. The first idea is perhaps best captured in the work of Seattle\u2019s Intergenerational Learning Center, where a preschool for under-fives is located in an elder care facility, which has an average age of 92.     The walls of the oval-shaped building are made of glass, which open as sliding doors so the courtyard is an integral part of the children\u2019s day. Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP    Five days a week, the residents and more than 100 children come together for a variety of planned activities such as music, dancing, art, lunch, storytelling or just visiting. Most interestingly, the parents of the students have said they don\u2019t send their children primarily for the experience with older people, but because they appreciate the quality of the learning that is fostered by this unusual environment.    When children get wet \u2026 they get changed. And they never melt. They are much stronger than an iPhone  Takaharu Tezuka     Of course, numerous studies have shown that increased social interaction has a significant and positive effect \u2013 not only on loneliness and depression, but also delaying mental decline, lowering blood pressure, and reducing risk of disease in older people. But children who have early and sustained contact with their elders are also known to be less likely to exhibit ageism. In Birmingham \u2013 in a less dramatically intergenerational exercise \u2013 the Radical Childcare project is thinking how best to redesign the childcare system to fit both children and parents as the world of work changes quickly and dramatically. One idea being fleshed out, \u201ccooperative childcare\u201d, is based around two guiding principles: to make the most of new technologies to connect supply and demand in more efficient ways, and use the skills and knowledge of communities to become \u201cco-producers\u201d of childcare, rather than parents remaining peripheral to planning. Aside from these intergenerational experiments, there are other factors at play in designing ideal spaces for children. According to Tezuka, it\u2019s important to ensure public and private spaces are designed in a way that respects children\u2019s rights to play. But he warns this can be harder to design when the prevailing culture is so risk averse.     Takaharu Tezuka with the model for Fuji Kindergarten. Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP    \u201cThe situation is the same all over the world \u2013 but especially in Asian countries, like China, where many families have only one child,\u201d Tezuka says. \u201cThey don\u2019t like taking children to the mountains or rivers, and by restricting the movement of children, they don\u2019t know how to take care of themselves in nature. But human beings are capable of adjusting to many different kinds of environment; they live in Dubai and Alaska. That is how we were supposed to be.\u201d Tezuka gives the example of his own 11-year-old son, who can dive underwater to catch fish. \u201cThese things used to be common, but then people started saying, \u2018Oh it\u2019s too dangerous.\u2019 They warn that children can drown in water that\u2019s only a metre deep \u2013 but they drown because they have never been trained.\u201d Tezuka\u2019s Fuji Kindergarten is certainly based around a different set of principles. First of all, there\u2019s the famous roof \u2013 designed as an endless circuit but with obstructions, like those trees popping up through the roof-floor. \u201cThere are so many ways to explore, so they can make choices,\u201d Tezuka explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not a training facility, but an opportunity. Some children cover more than 4,000 metres before lunchtime; that is eight times more than in a normal kindergarten.\u201d   Related: The popsicle test: what makes a city good for children?    The second element is the lack of boundary between outside and inside. \u201cOf course in the cold weather between end of November and mid-March we close the windows, but most of the time the space is kept open. There was one specialist who visited us and asked: what happens if children get wet? I told him: in Japan, when children get wet, it\u2019s quite simple, they get changed. And they never melt. They are much stronger than an iPhone!\u201d Tezuka also makes a fascinating claim \u2013 which is yet to be fully researched \u2013 that the lack of physical boundaries leads to fewer psychological divisions between the children, and thus stamps out bullying. \u201cWhen you make a boundary around a group, they make a hierarchy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you take that away, there is no bullying, because there is no hiding place.\u201d Finally, the Fuji Kindergarten is deliberately noisy. Humans have an amazing capacity for noise cancellation, says Tezuka. \u201cIn school design, we are doing it to an extreme, trying to make very quiet environments, but we need noise to hear other people. In the jungle, silence is the sign that a predator is coming to eat you, so silence equals danger.\u201d Even so, Tezuka cautions against architects\u2019 nostalgia \u201cabout a past that didn\u2019t exist\u201d. \u201cThe answer is already within your society,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know how to look at it.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here", "title": "Kids and the city: how do you build the perfect space for children?", "sentences": ["But human beings are capable of adjusting to many different kinds of environment; they live in Dubai and Alaska."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-20T07:30:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/20/how-the-guardian-ranked-the-worlds-top-100-footballers-for-2016", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "For our fifth annual survey we have gathered our biggest panel yet: 124 judges from 45 countries choosing the 100 best male footballers in the world in 2016.

No Test team have ever lost by an innings having scored as many as 477 in their first knock but England managed that with room to spare. The game was lost with 10 overs to spare and the margin was monumental, a humiliating innings and 75 runs. Ravindra Jadeja, the more straightforward of India\u2019s spinners, finished with career-best figures of seven for 48, a reward for skilful persistence and a consequence of some wanton, brain-dead batting. Jadeja settled proceedings with preposterous ease though Karun Nair, the triple centurion, was declared the man of a match that should have been consigned to the record books as a quirky run-fest. Instead it will be remembered for a spineless capitulation triggered not by a batting lineup who do not care but one drained by the demands of an exhausting tour and overwhelmed by the constant excellence of an India side who have ruthlessly exploited their frailties. The result was a procession of batsmen, all with accomplishments at this level, performed like callow novices.   Related: Alastair Cook refuses to discuss future of England captaincy after India loss    There was a nasty parallel with the Test match in Dhaka many moons ago. It is only eight weeks since the England openers, Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett (remember him?) finished one session on 100 for no wicket against Bangladesh, whereupon England went from dominance to dominoes. Just a gentle nudge was required and they all fell over for 164. This was probably a more incomprehensible collapse, in which England lost their last six wickets for 15 runs. The bowlers in Chennai may have been of higher quality but the pitch was so much more benign than in Dhaka, as the scorecard hints. One difference was the England dressing room had nothing left to give in Chennai; their bodies may still ripple with muscles but their minds are exhausted. No matter how reliable the surface they found a way to get out. Cook and Keaton Jennings took England safely to lunch with deceptive ease. The two lean left-handers had taken the score to 97 for no wicket and at times it was hard to tell one from the other \u2013 except when the reverse sweep was employed. That was a cast-iron indication Jennings was on strike. There were some alarms. Cook on four was dropped behind the stumps off Ravi Ashwin, who beat the bat on numerous occasions in pursuit of his second wicket of the match, which, amazingly, he never found. Jennings was composed against the spinners, the likes of which he has seldom encountered at Chester-le-Street. It was curious Virat Kohli took so long \u2013 70 minutes \u2013 to introduce Jadeja since the left-arm spinner has tormented Cook throughout the series, dismissing him six times. Jadeja\u2019s first ball elicited an lbw appeal and a review but an unsuccessful one. Lunchtime represented the zenith of England\u2019s innings. After the break Cook was caught at leg slip off Jadeja glancing what was an apparently innocuous delivery that was missing leg stump by nine inches. This was not just bad luck. The England captain has been out this way before; India knew that; so did Cook, therefore this can be construed as poor shot selection. At his alert best Cook would have ignored the delivery. Three more wickets fell in swift succession and Jadeja was always involved. Jennings was caught and bowled; Joe Root swept as he has done frequently in this series and India\u2019s review was successful this time. Soon after Jonny Bairstow somehow managed to chip a leg-side delivery from Ishant Sharma over midwicket, where Jadeja sprinted back to take a brilliant catch, which was a testament to his athleticism. For almost 20 overs Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes stayed together, with the former in no mood to restrict his strokeplay. They guided England to tea and through the next 25 minutes after the interval. A safe haven after a tortuous winter journey was in sight. Moeen then fell to Jadeja in a manner that will haunt him and which must have exasperated his colleagues. Down the wicket he came and his attempt to hit the ball over mid on failed wretchedly; Ashwin took the catch. In this match Moeen has scored 190 runs, a startling achievement, and he has been dismissed playing two of the most horrendous shots imaginable. Square that circle if you can. That aberration may have been forgotten if England had managed to save the game but now the dressing room was fearing the worst and then experiencing it. India closed in on their prey expertly and without mercy; Kohli had the right bowler for every batsman. Usually it was Jadeja, who soon induced an emasculated Stokes to chip to midwicket.   Related: India beat England by innings and 75 runs to seal 4-0 series win \u2013 live!    Now the dominoes were falling fast. Liam Dawson went for a duck, duped by a perfect, undetected googly from Amit Mishra. Yadav was the man for Adil Rashid; the first delivery with the second new ball finished with a gentle catch to cover (Jadeja, of course) and then the left-arm spinner polished off the tail. By now Jadeja seemed capable of turning the ball on glass so Stuart Broad and Jake Ball could at least claim to be the recipients of good balls, a luxury denied most of their superiors. So England head home, a disconsolate bunch, utterly outplayed, numbed by their capitulation and burdened by the gnawing realisation they crumpled in the fourth and fifth Tests after their R&amp;R excursion to Dubai. In some quarters Cook will be held responsible for every shortcoming, for that is the way of the world. Some of that criticism will be intemperate but the firm expectation is Cook will be at Lord\u2019s in July for the first Test against South Africa as an experienced opening batsman who will be glancing over at his captain at the toss to see whether he should put on his pads.", "title": "England end series on sorry note as fifth Test collapse gives India 4-0 win", "sentences": ["So England head home, a disconsolate bunch, utterly outplayed, numbed by their capitulation and burdened by the gnawing realisation they crumpled in the fourth and fifth Tests after their R&amp;R excursion to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-20T10:37:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/20/khizr-khan-vilified-trump-far-right-voice-heard", "tags": ["US news", "World news", "US elections 2016", "US politics", "Donald Trump", "Race issues", "Religion"], "article": "As you look out from Khizr Khan\u2019s home in Virginia, the Blue Ridge mountains sweep magnificently to one side. Monticello, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s idyllic estate, is a few miles in the other direction. And in between, still spiked into his neighbour Richard\u2019s front lawn, is a plastic campaign sign that says \u201cTRUMP\u201d. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s going to leave it up for the next four years,\u201d says Khan, with a smile that turns into a sigh. Shaking his head, he takes a sip of tea and reaches for a small box of chocolates. It is a month since the man who taunted Khan and his wife Ghazala following their headline-making appearance at the Democratic convention was elected to the world\u2019s most powerful office, and reminders of Trump\u2019s victory are everywhere. But around the Khans\u2019 living room, so too are mementos of having lived through much worse. Their late son Humayun stares down from one wall, handsome and steadfast in his army portrait. His posthumous Bronze Star and Purple Heart awards are nearby. Humayun, a captain who was killed defending his unit from a suicide bomber in Iraq in 2004, would have turned 40 this year. \u201cWe miss him so very much,\u201d says Khan. Still, Khan is shaken by Trump\u2019s win and a subsequent spike in hate crimes across the US. Muslim friends say their children are being bullied. A doctor from Long Island told him a new patient refused to be treated by her when he saw her headscarf. Hostility toward Muslims is more intense than at any time since Khan arrived in the US in 1980, he says. \u201cThe far right feels that their voice has been heard and they have a licence to commit these crimes,\u201d he says. \u201cI have seen the fear of immigrants heighten after turmoil in the past. But never to this degree.\u201d Khan has taken advice from the police about securing his home. He advises the women in his family not to travel alone. He is furious at Trump for not doing more to help. \u201cThese are your people, whom you have encouraged to commit these crimes,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a responsibility as a leader to end it.\u201d Rather than move to calm the anti-Muslim fervour, Trump has made one of its most prominent advocates his national security adviser. Mike Flynn, a retired army lieutenant general who described Islam as \u201ca vicious cancer\u201d and said \u201cfear of Muslims is rational\u201d, will help Trump direct US military policy. Suggesting that Flynn is \u201cill, mentally\u201d, Khan is deeply concerned about the implications for foreign relations. Not that the appointment should be surprising. Having dismissed Mexican migrants as rapists and criminals in his first campaign speech, Trump told voters rattled by terrorist attacks in California and Paris that he would ban all Muslims from entering the US. He later proposed barring only those from countries compromised by extremism. Khan doesn\u2019t expect Trump to actually implement the ban, nor a new \u201cregistry\u201d of Muslims he also floated. These were more likely cynical ploys \u201cto get votes from the simple-minded people that fell for it\u201d, he says. But damage has still been done. It was Trump\u2019s announcement of the Muslim ban last year that led a reporter to call Khan, who was quoted hailing his son\u2019s patriotism and sharply criticising Trump. \u201cMuslims are American, Muslims are citizens,\u201d he said. An aide to Hillary Clinton saw the article, and invited Khan to appear at July\u2019s convention in Philadelphia. His six-minute speech, with Ghazala at his side, caused a sensation.           Khizr Khan gives a stirring speech at the Democratic convention in honor of his son, Humayun     \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing and no one,\u201d he told Trump, who avoided serving in Vietnam because of alleged bone spurs on his feet. Waving a miniature US constitution that he\u2019d pulled from his jacket pocket, Khan asked Trump if he\u2019d even read the document. \u201cI will gladly lend you my copy,\u201d he said, to thundering applause. Khan keeps a stack of the booklets on a table beneath Humayun\u2019s portrait. Visitors struggle to leave without one. Incapable of letting a slight go unanswered, Trump called Khan \u201cvery emotional\u201d and suggested he didn\u2019t allow Ghazala to speak because of their religion. He moaned on Twitter: \u201cMr Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over TV doing the same \u2013 Nice!\u201d Horrified Republicans disowned Trump. Khan said he had a \u201cblack soul\u201d. The dispute was pencilled in as a chapter in the political obituary Trump seemed to be writing for himself. Things turned out differently. As the results rolled in last month, the Khans were VIP guests at Clinton\u2019s election night event in Manhattan, where Ghazala was treated as a rockstar by actual rockstars. \u201cA lady comes to Mrs Khan and says: \u2018Mrs Khan, can I take a picture with you?\u2019,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe pulled the hood on her hoodie down \u2026 and it was Cher.\u201d Katy Perry and Lady Gaga did the same, he said. But then, \u201cit all got quieter\u201d. Tearful supporters, who had been dancing in the aisles, traipsed out of the hall as the outcome became clear. Khan, 66 and on a break from work as a legal consultant, has tried to stay upbeat by stepping up a speaking tour that grew out of his convention appearance. He has been preaching tolerance and pluralism to schoolchildren across the US. \u201cNever be disheartened,\u201d he tells them. The packed schedule has exhausted him. Sniffing and coughing, he visibly drains over the course of our two-hour conversation. He is posing for photographs with a team of Japanese journalists as I arrive; an evening function beckons after I leave. But he is energised by encounters while traversing the country as a recognisable face. Sitting in the eighth row on a recent flight home from Ohio, he was approached by two men sitting in first class. They shook his hand and offered him their seats. \u201cWe voted for Trump, but we want to thank you,\u201d they told him. He politely declined. As we speak, Ghazala, 65, is busy with one of their four grandchildren, who are between eight months and five years old. She and Khan were born in Pakistan and met at university in Lahore. They came to the US after a spell in Dubai, and live in a smart but unflashy four-bedroom house on a tranquil bluff a few miles outside Charlottesville. They have two adult sons, who advised them against getting involved in politics. Sinking slowly into his sofa, Khan says the volume of abusive emails he received following the convention has declined, but he still deals with a couple of racist messages each day. He won\u2019t show the worst, saying he erases them. In one new arrival on his iPhone, though, a man named Scott Glover felt the need to gleefully remind Khan: \u201cTrump won the election and you, Hillary and the rest of the deplorable libs lost.\u201d Rightwing websites including Breitbart News, run until recently by Trump\u2019s top adviser, went after the Khans with undisguised venom following the convention. One spurious story, based on a 33-year-old essay Khan wrote, claimed he championed sharia law. Another accused him of taking money from the Clintons. It was actually another lawyer named Khan. Such was the vitriol that Clinton, who knows a bit about brutal media coverage, asked him when they met at a rally in New Hampshire: \u201cOh my God, how are you putting up with all this?\u201d He told her it was worth it, and she assured him: \u201cYou\u2019re doing something good.\u201d He has no regrets about entering the political warzone: \u201cThere comes a time when one has to take a stand.\u201d     Khan at his son\u2019s grave. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images    And much of the response has been cheering. Their dining room table is covered in fanmail from across the world. Letters addressed with only their names and Charlottesville now find their way to the house. Khan is particularly proud of one letter, which he pulls from an A4 brown envelope. \u201cMayor of London,\u201d the header says. \u201cAs Salaamu Alaikum,\u201d meaning \u201cpeace be unto you\u201d, the two-page handwritten letter from Sadiq Khan begins. Saying that he was \u201cdeeply moved\u201d by the convention speech, London\u2019s first Muslim mayor tells Khan it demonstrated the power of \u201cdiversity, tolerance and liberty\u201d. \u201cThese great American values are also Islamic values,\u201d the mayor writes, \u201cand your determination to live by these values has inspired many Londoners of all faiths and backgrounds.\u201d A bitter argument has broken out among Democrats since Clinton\u2019s defeat about whether she spent too much time on these issues of identity and not enough appealing to struggling white males from the rust belt. Khan sides with those who dismiss this as a false dichotomy. \u201cI am biased,\u201d he says, \u201cbut sometimes a moral stand has to be taken, and it\u2019s worth the cost. I am glad that she spoke up. I believe in equal dignity. We all have equal rights regardless of our gender or our preferences.\u201d Nonetheless, Khan, a political independent who voted for both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, does think Hillary also failed to stress the dangers of Trump\u2019s wild economic threats against China to the farmers and factory workers of the midwest. \u201cYou will not be able to sell your soybeans if we have a trade war with China,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will rot right here, and we will have the same people who voted Trump in standing outside the White House trying to throw him out.\u201d He makes the case better than Clinton did, but has no interest in running for office. He reveals Terry McAuliffe, Virginia\u2019s governor and a close ally of the Clintons, asked him to. \u201cBut it would limit me,\u201d he says. \u201cJust let me speak.\u201d He is also, he notes, still not a Democrat. It may be the tiredness talking, or the practised search for optimism of a parent who has lived through the worst possible grief. But Khan veers from despair about Trump\u2019s election to predictions that maybe it won\u2019t be as bad as it seems. \u201cWe just have to hang in there a little longer,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen he moves to Washington, things will surely be different.\u201d One thing he\u2019s sure about, though, is \u201cTrump needs to come off Twitter\u201d. Khan stays away from social media, having seen its perils. In his legal career, Khan specialises in electronic evidence discovery. In one case he worked on, a driver involved in a deadly 2007 vehicle crash was told by his lawyer to erase a Facebook photo showing him holding a beer and wearing a T-shirt that read \u201cI \u2665 Hot Moms\u201d. But the other side had already downloaded it. The lawyer is now serving a five-year suspension. \u201cNobody is telling Trump the damage it can do,\u201d says Khan. He does not, however, offer his services as a consultant to the president-elect. At a loss for many more words of his own, Khan unfolds a printout he shows his student audiences. It is a quotation by Elie Wiesel, the writer and Auschwitz survivor, who died in July. It is what he believes. \u201cWe must always take sides,\u201d Wiesel said. \u201cNeutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.\u201d", "title": "\u200bKhizr Khan on being vilified by Trump: 'The far right feels that their voice has been heard'", "sentences": ["They came to the US after a spell in Dubai, and live in a smart but unflashy four-bedroom house on a tranquil bluff a few miles outside Charlottesville."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-20T13:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/20/slick-charming-and-well-produced-readers-review-super-mario-run", "tags": ["Super Mario", "Games", "Nintendo", "Technology"], "article": "After the disappointment of Miitomo, Nintendo has once again ventured into the world of smartphone gaming with Super Mario Run.  Following on from the success of the release of Pok\u00e9mon Go in the summer, the anticipation from fans craving the nostalgia of classic Nintendo games has come to an end. But with some unhappy about the price of the iOS exclusive app we asked readers what they really think of the game.      \u2018Hardcore gamers might prefer to stick to their console versions\u2019 Rating: 3.5 out of 5  The inability to run backwards is often quite frustrating. With previous Super Mario games it\u2019s fun to explore each level to make sure you\u2019ve covered all ground. Because Mario is running forward continuously, it feels like you\u2019re running past hidden features. I think it\u2019s more a game for the busy commuter who likes to pass the time by fiddling with their iPhone. It only really requires half your attention; I feel as though Nintendo deliberately tapped into that market to get people who don\u2019t normally play games to download the app. But you can\u2019t help but question how much you\u2019re really \u2018playing\u2019 the game when you\u2019re merely tapping the screen.  You can actually leave Mario up to his own devices for a while and he\u2019ll do his own thing. It would be the perfect game for zombies. Apart from that the look of the game is awesome. It\u2019s very sleek and shiny and looks especially good on an iPad Air screen, much better than Super Mario on the 3DS. I think it\u2019s great that they\u2019re developing games as an app; you can basically choose your own hardware now.  I can\u2019t believe people are upset that they\u2019ve had to pay 8 quid to then discover they don\u2019t like it, especially considering they get the first three levels for free. Because it\u2019s an app they feel they are entitled to it for nothing. My advice is, if you don\u2019t think you can face the disappointment of not liking it, don\u2019t buy it. Hardcore gamers might prefer to stick to their console versions.  Jonathan Chadwick, Sydney      \u2018Slick, charming, and well-produced\u2019 Rating: 3.5 out of 5  Nintendo have a long, celebrated history of creating and perfecting platform games, so it comes as no surprise that Super Mario Run has the tight mechanics and precision-based jumping that we\u2019ve come to expect from the world\u2019s most famous gaming mascot.  At a price of \u00a37.99, they have exceeded what the casual mobile gamer is willing to pay for on-the-go entertainment. Additionally, it\u2019s only playable with an internet connection, which seems like a ludicrous caveat when you\u2019ve already paid almost \u00a38.  The game itself is a slick, charming, and well-produced endless runner that is playable with one hand. The level-design is fantastic; each of the 24 stages has been crafted to be re-playable with harder difficulties in the shape of collectible coloured coins. I happily repeated the same levels several times, trying to figure out the exact route I needed to take, and when executed correctly it felt very rewarding. Super Mario Run is a polished, meticulously designed, and ultimately fun mobile title that does more than just appeal to nostalgia. However, it comes at a price that many casual gamers will find hard to justify.  Zia Murad, Dubai      \u2018I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast\u2019 Rating: 4 out of 5  I think the one hand operation is good. Most people dislike that Mario moves automatically, but I think this makes the game more challenging - like getting pink coins or grey coins. Most people just play the first three levels and stop, but I think the game just gets started from that point! I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast =(  For 9.99 the price is a bit high. It would be great if it was a free game but a one time payment is fine. It would be better if there was more of a social aspect, mini game option, or even the ability to battle with friends.  M, Hong Kong      \u2018My favourite thing about the game is they let me pay for it\u2019 Rating: 4.5 out of 5  Nintendo has built a Mario game that feels like a Mario game, but is not hampered by the limits of a mobile. Mario looks like Mario, sounds like Mario, and most importantly for a Mario game jumps like Mario. Unlike an endless runner the stages are handcrafted, built to provide a modest challenge with precise positioning of coins, blocks, and enemies. The challenge of collecting five specific coloured coins drives you to retry each stage multiple times, and when you succeed, the five coins will be placed elsewhere.  It\u2019s a great game for a quick dip in and out of. A run takes mere moments which is perfect. It handles wonderfully, one thumb touch which does everything you want it to do. The design choice of having a chunk of unused space at the bottom of the screen means that unlike most mobile games I never feel like my touching the screen gets in the way of seeing the action. But my favourite thing about Super Mario Run: they let me pay for it. A one off payment unlocks everything I need. There is nothing pushing me to drop more money to buy new lives, or buy gems which are needed to purchase levels or anything like that. A one off \u00a38 payment for a quality game single handedly solves every problem I\u2019ve had with other mobile games. I look forward to completing it during the excessive loading times when fast travelling in Final Fantasy XV.  John Price, Plymouth     Sullivan, Brooklyn    \u2018Terrible marketing\u2019 Rating: 2.5 out of 5  Paying 10 bucks after a few levels is terrible marketing. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve checked out popular games but the money comes in the items not the actual gameplay. If I have to pay 99 cents for a special move, fine, but I shouldn\u2019t have to pay money to play the next level.  Sullivan, Brooklyn      \u2018A crafted product with depth and replay value\u2019 Rating: 4.5 out of 5  I can\u2019t get my head around the negative reaction to this game. Its easily worth \u00a37.99 in my opinion. You play the first three levels, then decide if you want to pay - seems perfectly reasonable to me. I don\u2019t know why so many people expected to play the whole game for free.  This isn\u2019t your average iOS shovel-ware - it\u2019s a crafted product with depth and replay value. On one hand it concerns me that people don\u2019t seem to be able to tell the difference - on the other, I suppose this is an inherent risk when aiming a product at the mass market. Yesterday, I spent \u00a36.50 for two coffees and a slice of shortcake, and \u00a37.99 for Super Mario Run. I know which purchase I think was better value. Dani Thomas, Cardiff      \u2018Mario for the modern world\u2019 Rating: 5 out of 5  Super Mario Run is a seemingly simple, yet deceptively complex mobile version of a gaming legend. The auto-run-forward of the portly plumber detracts nothing from the side scrolling platform action, instead allowing more attention to be paid to the at times frustrating pixel perfect jump. Speaking of pixels, the graphics are detailed and hi-res enough to satisfy modern eyes.  The Nintendo charm is ever present throughout and fans of Mario will be pleased with the look and tone of the package. Yes, the package. People bemoaned the \u00a37.99 charge upon reaching the first Koopa confrontation. However, in my opinion there is enough to satisfy. Six worlds, three levels and a boss battle in each. There\u2019s also a road rally which shifts the emphasis of the platforming action to style over course completion and enemy squashing. This leads to village building and toad pleasing mini games. There\u2019s more than enough here to justify eight quid and it\u2019s a few notches above other mobile gaming fare as well, as like it or lump it, Nintendo are still masters of the video game. This is Mario for the modern world. Quick bursts on the loo, on the tram/train/bus, while you wait for your wife to look through the whole shop and for some, while they walk around narrowly avoiding lampposts. Buy it. Enjoy it.

But GoMetro is an app from South Africa and Careem is an Uber-style firm working across the Middle East and north Africa. They are typical of some of the innovative partnerships in the global south producing ideas from which many western governments and companies could learn.    Related: Why does it still take so long to drive across Africa? | Tunde Kehinde     The GoMetro mobile app was developed by Justin Coetzee in 2011 after he was left standing on a Cape Town train platform, delayed again without explanation. This is not an uncommon problem in South Africa, where people using public transport spend on average two and a half times longer commuting than Europeans. It occurred to Coetzee that real-time updates on a mobile device would make a big difference. Working closely with the Public Rail Agency of South Africa, Coetzee and his team developed the app to provide updated information and announcements on public transport timetables. GoMetro provides this service to the agency free of charge; its income comes from advertising on the app. While many European countries do have transport apps, Coetzee says patchy mobile connectivity is a barrier to this technology \u2013 something highlighted in a new report from the National Infrastructure Commission on how poor UK mobile connectivity is affecting the country\u2019s businesses. The UK is 54th  in the world for 4G coverage, lagging behind countries such as Romania, Albania, Panama and Peru. The average UK user is able to connect to the network a mere 53% of the time. But being innovative isn\u2019t just about technology. Another approach to transport has been pioneered by Careem, a ride-hailing service founded in Dubai by two consultants, Mudassir Sheikha and Magnus Olsson, who had travelled widely and realised the need for quick, reliable transport. So far, so Uber, you might say. But Careem prides itself on treating its fleet of more than 100,000 drivers, referred to as captains, fairly. Careem drivers are typically paid 30% more than comparable taxi drivers and the employees own around half the company, so they benefit when the company grows.    Related: Jordan cracks down on Uber and Careem as congestion clogs its capital    Sheikha says the company has been successful by understanding local problems, such as a service for women in countries like Saudi Arabia, where they are not permitted to drive.    Careem is now turning its attention to public transport. \u201cOur region does not have an elaborate public transport infrastructure,\u201d explains Sheikha. They are working on driverless \u201cpods\u201d that he says will enable the firm to build a highly efficient public transport infrastructure that leapfrogs the traditional way public transport has been built in the rest of the world.  Other public transport solutions can be found elsewhere. A 21-metre-long straddling bus was unveiled this year in China that runs along tracks two metres above the road, allowing cars to pass underneath, at speeds of up to 37mph. Each bus can transport 1,400 passengers at a time and several can be attached together. Those behind the project believe one straddling bus could replace 40 conventional buses. Urban regeneration researcher Deborah Talbot says the rapidly growing hubs of the global south are \u201callowing for innovation in transportation with a wild imagination we don\u2019t have in the UK\u201d. Concepts like the microbus, for instance, could help solve the need for a more frequent, smaller capacity service in rural areas of the UK. A team of students from Nairobi recently won the Hult prize for their Magic Bus ticketing company, an offline app for bus drivers in rural communities which offers precisely this type of service. Previously, many minibuses would not leave the depot until they were at capacity, which meant subsequently passing people on the roadside who could be there for hours. This app allows drivers to see those who have booked along the route, so they do not have to wait to leave until the bus is full. Passengers also get to track the vehicle along the journey, which helps to combat the risk of rural isolation.

It was August 2008. Christina Aguilera had serenaded hundreds of guests, each of whom had been given an iPod in their doggy bag after feasting on cake dusted with flakes of gold. \u201cI was standing there in the valet line waiting for my beat-up Mitsubishi to arrive in a sea of Bentleys, a sea of excess,\u201d she recalls. Chang had been invited as a journalist working for a luxury magazine. On the drive home she turned to her friend and said: \u201c\u2018Everything\u2019s going to collapse.\u2019 I remember thinking there\u2019s another story here that I really wanted to tell \u2013 a story set at a point when it was all going to change. I wanted to write about fracture, but I also wanted to write a different type of immigrant story: one that I hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d A fortnight later, Lehman Brothers filed the biggest bankruptcy petition in US history, forcing the US to confront its descent into recession. In The Wangs Vs the World, self-made millionaire Charles Wang has just suffered his own Lehmans moment, after the banks foreclosed on his cosmetics business. The first few pages of the novel were the first that Chang wrote, starting with three outraged paragraphs:  Charles Wang was mad at America. Actually, Charles Wang was mad at history. If the death-bent Japanese had never invaded China, if a million \u2013 a billion \u2013 misguided students and serfs had never idolised a balding academic who parroted Russian madmen and couldn\u2019t pay for his promises, then Charles wouldn\u2019t be standing here staring out the window of his beloved Bel-Air home, holding an aspirin in his hand, waiting for those calculating assholes from the bank \u2013 the bank that had once gotten down on its Italianate-marble knees and kissed his ass \u2013 to come over and repossess his life.  Packing his family into a 30-year-old station wagon, borrowed back from the woman who used to be his nanny, he sets off on a riotous 3,500-mile road trip from Los Angeles to hole up with his eldest daughter in New York, en route to fulfilling his dream of reclaiming his ancestral lands in China. With him in the car are his two younger children, wannabe standup Andrew and private-school brat Grace, and his second wife, Barbra \u2013 self-named after Barbra Streisand, to the cruel derision of her stepchildren.   Related: The Wangs Vs the World by Jade Chang review \u2013 a richly entertaining debut    The Wangs are both an embodiment of America and at at odds with it. On a literal level, their riches-to-rags story takes them in the opposite direction to most classic road-trip fiction, from west to east. The illusions of belonging that were shored up by extreme wealth are dashed when they take to the highway. \u201cSo, where are you from?\u201d asks a paramedic after their car spins off the road. \u201cNo, but where are you from from?\u201d he repeats, when a dazed Grace tries to insist that she\u2019s from LA. Chang, who lives and until recently worked as a journalist in Los Angeles, describes herself as \u201c100% Chinese, 100% American and 100% Asian, all at the same time\u201d. Though the novel is not autobiographical, the Wangs\u2019 history mirrors that of her own family, and one of the ways in which this is not the typical immigrant yarn is that neither family arrived impoverished in search of a better life.  She was born in 1976 in Ohio, the older of two daughters to Chinese parents who met at graduate school in the US. Both sides of the family had owned land in China, which they had lost under communism. \u201cThey had to flee the country and, along with many other people, fled with the nationalist army to Taiwan \u2013 not literally, but as part of the pretty widespread diaspora,\u201d she explains, \u201cThey grew up in a Taiwan that they basically colonised: only Mandarin was allowed to be spoken. A lot of native Taiwanese worked as cooks and nannies.\u201d It\u2019s a history that gave her an understanding of Charles Wang\u2019s yearning for the land that he feels is rightfully his, and an ear for his voice: \u201crageful, funny, ridiculous, kind of dumb in some ways but smart in others. Once I had Charles\u2019s voice I had the world and the family.\u201d Chang grew up speaking Mandarin at home and has peppered the dialogue with Chinese sentences, written in the English alphabet. \u201cI wanted people to have a sense of what it felt like to be in the car with the family and the way they would be speaking. I wanted readers to be able to sound out the words. I didn\u2019t actually translate any of it but it\u2019s all there in the context.\u201d She\u2019s intrigued that some readers have reported finding the Chinese dialogue \u201cdestabilising\u201d, pointing out that there are several different languages in the book, which readers may or may not understand. Charles\u2019s oldest daughter, Saina, is an artist provocateur who has suffered her own downfall after playing one stunt too many. \u201cIf you\u2019re really familiar with the art world you will have a different understanding of the story, just as you will if you\u2019re familiar with the fashion world or with finance. All the characters have to learn to understand each other\u2019s worlds and trust each other\u2019s interpretations of them.\u201d Both Saina and Andrew suffer for being unable to \u201cread\u201d the unwritten rules on racial representation and good taste. In one of the novel\u2019s most excruciating scenes, Andrew tanks at an open-mic comedy session in Austin, Texas. \u201cYou know what white people really, really, really love?\u201d he burbles. \u201cWhen Asian comedians make fun of their parents. Yep, because you guys just want an excuse to laugh at Asian actors. Black people, no offence, but in this joke you basically count as white people. Admit it, as soon as I came up, you thought to yourselves, \u2018oh man, I hope he says lots of R words, just tons of them.\u2019\u201d To understand what she was putting her character through, Chang enrolled on an improvisation course. The first three classes left her wondering if she was \u201cthis undiscovered comic genius \u2013 pitching situations is easy for me\u201d. But once it came to embodying the situations she had pitched, she fell flat on her face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be an Italian shopkeeper who\u2019s hobbled by holding a giant Parma ham and think about what to say at the same time.\u201d Though there is a lot of embarrassment in a novel that was described as \u201crichly entertaining\u201d in the Guardian, it always falls short of humiliation. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in putting something out in the world that leaves people feeling diminished in any way,\u201d she says. \u201cI like satire, but I\u2019m not interested in writing it because it\u2019s important to me to write something with a generosity of spirit and I don\u2019t think satire has that generosity. Like the protagonist of Paul Beatty\u2019s The Sellout, the Wangs come from Los Angeles. Though not as fast and furious as Beatty\u2019s Booker winner, the novel shares something of The Sellout\u2019s stroppy refusal to euphemise its characters\u2019 experience. \u201cI like to describe it as The Sellout meets Little Miss Sunshine, because I think that\u2019s funny but it\u2019s also spiritually accurate,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see it as The Corrections meets Crazy Rich Asians, but I think in intention and emotion that\u2019s not really it.\u201d For all the eccentricity of their predicament \u2013 and a diversity of viewpoint that extends to some passages being narrated by a car \u2013 the Wangs carry with them a weight of communal history, which is pointed out from time to time with Dickensian omniscience:  All across the country, one by one, foreclosed home by shuttered business, in cold bedrooms and empty boardrooms and cars turned into homes, people had the same thoughts. I couldn\u2019t rescue myself. I will never win. My failure will always be epic and my sorrow will always be great.  This is precisely the hardship and the social solipsism that propelled the UK out of Europe and Donald Trump into the White House.

While she might not have been a global household name like her US counterpart and friend Anna Wintour, she was undoubtedly a giant of Italian fashion. The industry has responded accordingly. In a tribute published on the American Vogue website, Wintour describes her as \u201cthe hardest-working person I have known, and with an envy-inducing ease with multitasking\u201d. A post on Marc Jacobs\u2019 Instagram reads: \u201cHer incredible contribution to fashion will be missed.\u201d     Sozzani in 2013 with the chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, Jonathan Newhouse, Naomi Campbell and Donatella Versace in 2013. Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for the Dubai Mall    At the helm of the Italy\u2019s most prominent fashion magazine for 28 years, Sozzani became known for working with photographers including Bruce Weber, Paolo Roversi and Steven Meisel on a magazine that was known for cutting-edge, talking-point visuals that often provoked debate. Sozzani produced an all-black issue in 2008, with only black models featured. It was reprinted three times. A plus-size issue followed three years later. She was the first to embrace the rise of reality TV stars, putting Kim Kardashian on the cover of L\u2019Uomo Vogue (which she also edited) in 2012, two years before American Vogue did the same.  Sometimes Sozzani\u2019s work was more controversial when the commercial nature of fashion jarred with issues of body image and gender politics. One shoot, in 2005, was based on women having plastic surgery; another, in 2014, prompted by the rise of domestic violence in Italy, featured girls running from knife-wielding men. \u201cFashion isn\u2019t really about clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about life.\u201d Sozzani saw anything that was part of the cultural conversation as fair game for a fashion shoot. She wanted to join that conversation.      Sozzani\u2019s famous \u2018Black Issue\u2019, which was devoted entirely to the celebration of black women\u2019s beauty. Photograph: Vogue    Her work shouted loudly, but Sozzani herself was a quieter presence on the fashion circuit, familiar to those in the know for her long-blond hair, uniform of 50s-style flared skirts, white shirts, diamond teardrop earrings and beatific smile. This continued until very recently. Despite being on oxygen, she appeared at the fashion awards in London earlier this month, to accept her award for positive change. Her final Instagram is a post of her, Wintour and Karl Lagerfeld at the Chanel show in Paris the same week.  The Sozzani family is a dynasty at the heart of Italian fashion. Her sister Carla founded the concept store Corso Como, and her son, Francesco Carrozzini, is a video director who worked with Lana Del Rey and Beyonc\u00e9. His last film, Franca: Chaos and Creation, a documentary six years in the making, was a portrait of his mother. It will be released in early 2017.

Related: Roger Federer\u2019s tumble at Wimbledon reminds us we are all human | Jacob Steinberg    \u201cAm I surprised Andy Murray is No1? No. I always expected him to be No1 at some point but finishing the year [in that position] is a different animal. I really respect Andy was able to get it done this way. It\u2019s going to be hard for Novak the next few months [in defending ranking points] because of the domination he had at the beginning of 2016. I think Andy is going to hang on for a while but it\u2019s going to be a neck-and-neck race for the next six months.\u201d Federer was for many years in that privileged position but the 35-year-old begins his 19th season on Tour at 16th in the ATP rankings, the first time since 2001 he has been outside the top\u00a010. His chances of adding to his 17 majors are slim and he will do well to make the second week of the Australian Open, which starts in Melbourne on 14\u00a0January, but he seemed to be in good spirits after the longest layoff of his career. He struggled for months with the effects of a freak injury in Melbourne a year ago when he twisted his knee while running a bath for one of his children, and resorted to surgery in March, the first such experience of his career. He fell heavily on his injured knee during his semi-final defeat to Milos Raonic at Wimbledon and has not played competitively since but he resumed hitting on court a month ago. \u201cThe goal was to be fully fit by the end of November, early December,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew it was going to take a while to give the knee sufficient rest, not to hurry in the beginning. I went on vacation at the beginning of November for two weeks. The last few weeks have been crucial, to see how much load I can put on my legs. We quickly realised [when he resumed training] I wasn\u2019t 100% but it went very well, no setbacks. It\u2019s all great. \u201cThe good thing about the layoff is I didn\u2019t have to have surgery after Wimbledon, two surgeries in the same year. I just had to rest. I could play tennis, standing or walking \u2013 but I didn\u2019t need to do it. Just before the US Open I had a bit of a reaction, so it was too early. It was always a great feeling to get on the court because I was spending a lot of time in the gym. It\u2019s always refreshing to get back on the tennis court. \u201cI played well [in practice this month], struggling to find the serve but that is coming on very well. I might practise on the 26th and 27th, and fly to the Hopman Cup on the 28th. I finished my last [fitness] session two days ago with Pierre [Paganini]. In previous years, after a short off-season, I tried to pack in too much. Also it\u2019s important to be around family and kids at Christmas.\u201d Federer denied the layoff had drawn him closer towards retirement. He said he had enjoyed the opportunity to relax at home with his wife Mirka and their four children \u2013 who will all be travelling to Australia with him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I missed anything. It just felt right, the perfect way for me to take a rest for my body and my game. I\u2019m always travelling with my family, always see them, but it was just nice to see them in one place. Nice to settle, get good routines for the kids. It felt good but also I cranked it up in the gym the last couple of months, It felt good to be busy. It was the right moment to have it. \u201cThis year is unique. Maybe more than any time before I do need matches. There is a different intensity. I remember playing Hopman Cup against Lleyton Hewitt [in 2001] and was in pain for a week with muscle pain. I\u2019ve played over 15 sets in practice the last few weeks and I feel I am there. It\u2019s been a great preparation.\u201d Asked if the record $50m prize money on offer for the first major of the season in Melbourne suggested the game might direct more funds towards hunting down users of performance-enhancing drugs, Federer said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to tell but with all the money there is in the sport you would think there would be more anti-doping money. We\u2019ve had issues in the past. \u201cI would like to see more funding, especially in the off-season; this is when the players work hardest. There are a few countries who test and other countries never test.

The four-hour standoff with negotiators from Malta and Libya ended on Friday when the two men came out of the Afriqiyah Airways plane with a crewmember who was their final hostage, and were led away in handcuffs. The crew and 116 other passengers on board were allowed to leave the plane in batches, after which the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, tweeted:    Hijackers surrendered, searched and taken in custody.&mdash; Joseph Muscat (@JosephMuscat_JM) December 23, 2016    In a later tweet, he said initial examinations had shown that the weapons used were replicas. The Airbus A320, operated by the state-owned airline, was hijacked on an internal route between the cities of Sabha and Tripoli. During the negotiations, one of the hijackers told Libya\u2019s Channel TV in a phone call that he headed a party supporting Gaddafi, and had organised the incident to promote the group. But the men\u2019s exact demands, relayed to a team of Libyan and Maltese officials after Muscat spoke with his Libyan counterpart, remained unclear even after the negotiations were wrapped up.  Muscat said the negotiators had refused to open discussions until all passengers had been released and denied a report from the Libyan foreign minister that the men had claimed political asylum. \u201cThe hijackers were told that in order for any discussions to be entertained, they should release all passengers first,\u201d Muscat said. \u201cThis request was negotiated and eventually accepted and passengers were released in groups.\u201d The men\u2019s party was apparently called the New Al-Fateh, a reference to the 1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power, Reuters reported. Photos from Malta appeared to show a hijacker standing outside the plane with a green flag like those used by Gaddafi supporters. Libya\u2019s autocratic former leader was toppled and killed in a 2011 uprising, during which three of his sons also died. Since then, much of the oil-rich, sparsely populated country has descended into chaos. Rival governments are vying for control, with western nations backing the UN-brokered administration as the best hope for uniting Libya, while a parliament that meets in the far east refuses to accept the government\u2019s authority.     One of the hijackers waves a Gaddafi-era Libyan flag outside the plane. Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters    The power vacuum has allowed affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida to take root and fuelled human trafficking along the coast. In recent years Libya\u2019s beaches have become a key jumping-off point for migrants and refugees attempting the dangerous sea journey to Europe. The chaos in Libya may also have allowed the men to smuggle their weapons on board.  The men initially told the pilot to fly to Malta, 220 miles (350km) north of Tripoli, but then briefly headed back towards Libya, and finally turned around again to land in Malta, an Afriqiyah Airways official said. The pilot had tried to persuade the hijackers to land in Libya, Reuters quoted a security source at the main airport as saying. \u201cThe pilot reported to the control tower in Tripoli that they were being hijacked, then they lost communication with him,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe pilot tried very hard to have them land at the correct destination.\u201d All flights to and from Malta\u2019s airport were cancelled or diverted during the standoff, and security forces gathered near the plane, which sat on the runway with its engines running long after it had landed.

Malta has been a destination for hijackers before. In 1985, an EgyptAir flight from Athens to Cairo was forced to land on the island, where a 24-hour ordeal ended with the death of 60 hostages. Many of them were killed when Egyptian commandos stormed the plane in what was considered a botched operation.     Some passengers disembark from the hijacked Libyan Afriqiyah Airways flight on the runway at Malta airport. Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters    Twelve years earlier, the then prime minister, Dom Mintoff, negotiated a successful conclusion to another hijacking. A KLM flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo was hijacked over Iraqi airspace, then flew to Malta after it was refused landing permission everywhere else. Mintoff secured the release of 247 passengers and eight crewmembers in return for fuel, and the plane headed to Dubai, where the remaining hostages were released.

For Scott Dann and company though, change is almost certainly in the south London air. One of the first things Sam Allardyce did on taking charge at Sunderland was to begin firing off frequent emails to every player. Packed with video clips, the accompanying attachments both deconstructed their own strengths and weaknesses and provided detailed briefings on future opponents.   Related: Sam Allardyce the organiser will bring normality back to Crystal Palace    When they came into training the next day, recipients were not only expected to be fully conversant with the party pieces and vulnerabilities of rivals included in these mini dossiers but able to demonstrate enhanced understanding of their own games. \u201cIf a player digests his own statistical information in his own time, on his own laptop, tablet or whatever, without a coach standing over him, it makes it easier for him,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cIt helps with the pressure. There\u2019s a fear factor but spending time at home analysing things can help control it.\u201d He will expect such \u201cempowerment\u201d to produce sufficiently improved results to enable Palace to take a break in the Gulf \u2013 most likely Dubai or Doha \u2013 in February. A big believer in the benefits of Vitamin D derived direct from strong sunshine, he implored Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s owner, to fund a squad trip to the United Arab Emirates last season and credited it as a big reason why, against all odds, the club avoided relegation. \u201cHistorically almost every team I\u2019ve managed has returned from even just a five-day break with improved physical output,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cBolton, Blackburn, West Ham, Sunderland; Dubai had a big impact on them. The players are knackered after Christmas but we get them relaxed.\u201d He is equally keen on exposure to extreme cold. Cryotherapy is probably not unknown to his latest charges but Allardyce is so convinced of the merits of near daily post-training visits to a minus-135-degree ice chamber that he installed a state-of-the-art machine at Sunderland in an effort to accelerate muscle recovery. Jermain Defoe \u2013 who previously hired a mobile cryotherapy unit for \u00a31,000 per two-minute visit \u2013 swore by it, though certain team-mates were less enthusiastic. A blend of old school and the surprisingly progressive, the 62-year-old retains personal perspective by performing transcendental meditation most days. On Wearside Allardyce felt encouraging his players to follow suit might be a field too far but he did encourage them to visit the then newly recruited club psychologist. Meanwhile he harboured no compunction about boring his backline to tears courtesy of training sessions devoted to the ABC of rudimentary defending. Sometimes manhandling senior professionals while working on body shape and positioning in assorted situations, he prompted a radical improvement in, among others, Patrick van Aanholt, Sunderland\u2019s left-back, but admitted: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone so far back to basics, I\u2019m boring myself.\u201d That sentiment was shared by DeAndre Yedlin, the right-back then on loan from Tottenham Hotspur but now at Newcastle. \u201cEvery Thursday at Sunderland every defender would do strict defensive drills, with no attacking at all,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe hated it because it was not the most fun thing to do but it worked. And Sam made something click in my head. He made me think like a defender.\u201d Given the five goals Palace recently conceded at Swansea followed by a further three at Hull, Dann and friends should brace themselves for similar treatment.     Jermain Defoe was one of several key players who thrived under Sam Allardyce at Sunderland. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters    Once Defoe convinced Allardyce to stop accepting received wisdoms and deploy him as a lone forward, Sunderland settled into a 4-1-4-1 formation with certain gifted players \u2013 most notably Defoe and Wahbi Khazri \u2013 granted creative licence while some were asked to sacrifice their talent for the team. Selhurst Park regulars can expect Andros Townsend to be offered Khazri-style freedoms by a man who has long coveted the England winger but it may be different for others. Fabio Borini morphed from flamboyant striker into no-frills wide midfielder last season, with tracking back his new speciality. \u201cI call my job a blind role because people don\u2019t notice you, sometimes it\u2019s more about going backwards than forwards,\u201d said Sunderland\u2019s Italian forward last spring. \u201cBut it makes others\u2019 roles easier.\u201d   Related: The 100 best footballers in the world 2016 \u2013 interactive    Not that Borini disliked Allardyce. \u201cSam\u2019s a very straight guy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what he\u2019s thinking and, even if you don\u2019t, he\u2019s going to tell you.\u201d Indeed Dick Advocaat\u2019s successor was largely popular among his old Wearside squad who seemed to relish the amalgam of sometimes unreconstructed blokeishness with an unexpectedly subtle understanding of their assorted religions and cultures. Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, disillusioned with Advocaat, looked reborn under Allardyce, swiftly appearing a different player while also agreeing to serve as a de facto minder for his fellow the French speakers, Khazri, Lamine Kon\u00e9 and Yann M\u2019Vila. \u201cSam knows the Premier League better than his own family,\u201d said Kaboul, now at Watford, last spring. \u201cHe knows how to upset teams, stay in games and win them. I don\u2019t think he needed much time to understand us as footballers or people. One week of training was enough.\u201d Behind the sometimes uncomfortably brash exterior lurks sufficient emotional intelligence for Allardyce to be acutely alive to dressing room ecosystems and, endeavouring to improve Sunderland\u2019s chemistry, he duly offloaded Costel Pantilimon and Steven Fletcher last January before signing Kon\u00e9, Khazri and Jan Kirchhoff. On his watch the squad remained astonishingly injury free, with his use of sports science to tailor individual regimes keeping even the notoriously frail Kirchhoff on the pitch. This fascination with data dictates that Allardyce, unlike Alan Pardew, will be comfortable debating analytics and its potential transfer market deployment alongside Palace\u2019s American backers. Indeed he adores discussing algorithms, Moneyball and his field trip to meet Billy Beane, the famous, analytics pioneering, general manager of Oakland Athletics baseball club. The \u201cAllardyce Algorithm\u201d is a little different from Beane\u2019s but, when it comes to survival, appears unrivalled.", "title": "The Sam Allardyce Algorithm may be new to Crystal Palace but it succeeds", "sentences": ["There\u2019s a fear factor but spending time at home analysing things can help control it.\u201d He will expect such \u201cempowerment\u201d to produce sufficiently improved results to enable Palace to take a break in the Gulf \u2013 most likely Dubai or Doha \u2013 in February.", "\u201cBolton, Blackburn, West Ham, Sunderland; Dubai had a big impact on them."], "publicationDate": "2016-12-25T16:59:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/football-transfer-rumour-mill-chelsea-manchester-city-steven-nzonzi", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Transfer window", "Chelsea", "Manchester City", "Arsenal", "Leicester City", "Swansea City"], "article": "Chelsea and Manchester City are engaged in a Christmas cracker of a ding-dong transfer battle, with both Antonio Conte and Pep Guardiola apparently desperate to fortify their midfield by spending \u00a326m on the former Stoke and Blackburn star Steven N\u2019Zonzi, who was playing very much under their noses and yet was unwanted by the Premier League giants until he moved to Sevilla for just more than a quarter of that sum \u2013 a paltry \u00a37m \u2013 last summer. But Chelsea\u2019s primary midfield focus could lie elsewhere, given the existence of a rival rumour linking them with a \u00a325m move for Atalanta\u2019s Franck Kessi\u00e9, while they are also one of a number of clubs \u2013 including Internazionale, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 said to be keen on the Fiorentina forward Federico Bernardeschi, who is unlikely to go anywhere before the end of the season.   Related: Leicester City agree deal to sign Genk midfielder Wilfred Ndidi for \u00a315m    Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is already considering replacements for contractual trouble-makers Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez, and has placed the Borussia Dortmund pair of Marco Reus and Christian Pulisic high on his list, though he might have to out-wrestle J\u00fcrgen Klopp if he is to stop Liverpool from swooping for them first. One potential Arsenal signing that is likely to be less hotly contested is that of Cohen Bramall, a 20-year-old left-winger spotted playing for Hednesford Town in the Evo-Stik Northern League Premier Division \u2013 and previously rejected by both Crewe and Leek Town \u2013 who apparently impressed so much on a recent two-day trial that a contract offer is imminent. Manchester United are ready to firm up their rumoured interest in Benfica\u2019s Nelson Semedo with a \u00a335m bid, though the right-back\u2019s transfer is unlikely to be completed before the summer, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho about to splash his entire allocation of January cash on another Benfica defender, Victor Lindelof. That much-mooted move might not go exactly as planned, however, with newspapers in Portugal predicting that the Swede will instead sign a new deal with the Portuguese giants, raising his buy-out clause to a chequebook-bothering \u00a350m. Newcastle plan to respond to their post-Christmas slide to second in the Championship by spending even more money, with Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson seen as the man to fire them back to the top of the table. They are also said to be \u201cleading the race\u201d to sign Chelsea\u2019s Ruben Loftus-Cheek on loan, though there are \u201cup to 10 clubs\u201d involved in that particular sprint. Middlesbrough, meanwhile, are keen on Udinese\u2019s Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu, though the Ghana midfielder\u2019s involvement in the African Cup of Nations might put a spanner in the works. A man who spent \u00a34,000 on the number plate VAR9Y in the hope of flogging it on to Jamie Vardy at a profit has sold it again for just \u00a32,080 after he was unable to contact the Leicester ace, who already has a personalised number plate on his blue Bentley. Despite that setback there will be some new arrivals at the Leicester training ground in January, with a deal for Racing Genk\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi all but complete and Claudio Ranieri handed a \u00a330m mid-season war chest, according to the Telegraph. The Watford striker Jerome Sinclair looks certain to spend the second half of the season on loan in the Championship, with Norwich, Reading, Brentford and Cardiff all interested in recruiting him. The latter club need a striker to replace Marouane Chamakh, who may only have played 46 minutes of league football this season but has been named on their substitutes\u2019 bench a few times, and could jet off to al-Arabi in Qatar in the new year. Who\u2019s going to be the new Swansea manager? The Sun exclusively reveal that Roy Hodgson \u201chas emerged as the strong candidate\u201d for the role suddenly and involuntarily vacated by bungling Bob Bradley on Tuesday, but elsewhere Ryan Giggs is near-unanimously considered the most likely hot-seat-sitter. And finally, another top Premier League star is being courted by China\u2019s Super League, who plan to offer a massive salary boost in an attempt to get their man.
